                        Representatives:</hi></p>
                <p>The Congress assembles this year under the shadow of a great calamity. On the
                    sixth of September, Presidert McKinley was shot by an anarchist while attending
                    the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo, and died in that city on the fourteenth
                    of that month.</p>
                <p>Of the last seven elected Presidents, he is the third who has been murdered, and
                    the bare recital of this fact is sufficient to justify grave alarm among all
                    loyal American citizens. Moreover, the circumstances of this, the third
                    assassination of an American President, have a peculiarly sinister significance.
                    Both President Lincoln and President Garfield were killed by assassins of types
                    unfortunately not uncommon in history; President Lincoln falling a victim to the
                    terrible passions aroused by four years of civil war, and President Garfield to
                    the revengeful vanity of a disappointed office-seeker. President McKinley was
                    killed by an utterly depraved criminal belonging to that body of criminals who
                    object to all governments, good and bad alike, who are against any form of
                    popular liberty if it is guaranteed by even the most just and liberal laws, and
                    who are as hostile to the upright exponent of a free people’s sober will as to
                    the tyrannical and irresponsible despot.</p>
                <p>It is not too much to say that at the time of President McKinley’s death he was
                    the most widely loved man in all the United States; while we have never had any
                    public man of his position who has been so wholly free from the bitter
                    animosities incident to public life. His political opponents were the first to
                    bear the heartiest and most generous tribute to the broad kindliness of nature,
                    the sweetness and gentleness of character which so endeared him to his close
                    associates. To a standard of lofty integrity in public life he united the tender
                    affections and home virtues which are all-important in the make-up of national
                    character. A gallant soldier in the great war for the Union, he also shone as an
                    example to all our people because of his conduct in the most sacred and intimate
                    of home relations. There could be no personal hatred of him, for he never acted
                        <pb n="X" xml:id="pg_X" facs="0010"/>with aught but consideration for the
                    welfare of others. No one could fail to respect him who knew him in public or
                    private life. The defenders of those murderous criminals who seek to excuse
                    their criminality by asserting that it is exercised for political ends, inveigh
                    against wealth and irresponsible power. But for this assassination even this
                    base apology cannot be urged.</p>
                <p>President McKinley was a man of moderate means, a man whose stock sprang from,
                    the sturdy tillers of the soil, who had himself belonged among the wage-workers,
                    who had entered the Army as a private soldier. Wealth was not struck at when the
                    President was assassinated, but the honest toil which is content with moderate
                    gains after a lifetime of unremitting labor, largely in the service of the
                    public. Still less was power struck at in the sense that power is irresponsible
                    or centered in the hands of any one individual. The blow was not aimed at
                    tyranny or wealth. It was aimed at one of the strongest champions the
                    wage-worker has ever had; at one of the most faithful representatives of the
                    system of public rights and representative government who has ever risen to
                    public office. President McKinley filled that political office for which the
                    entire people vote, and no President—not even Lincoln himself—was ever more
                    earnestly anxious to represent the well thought-out wishes of the people; his
                    one anxiety in every crisis was to keep in closest touch with the people—to find
                    out what they thought and to endeavor to give expression to their thought, after
                    having endeavored to guide that thought aright. He had just been re-elected to
                    the Presidency because the majority of our citizens, the majority of our farmers
                    and wage-workers, believed that he had faithfully upheld their interests for
                    four years. They felt themselves in close and intimate touch with him. They felt
                    that he represented so well and so honorably all their ideals and aspirations
                    that they wished him to continue for another four years to represent them.</p>
                <p>And this was the man at whom the assassin struck! That there might be nothing
                    lacking to complete the Judas-like infamy of his act, he took advantage of an
                    occasion when the President was meeting the people generally; and advancing as
                    if to take the hand outstretched to him in kindly and brotherly fellowship, he
                    turned the noble and generous confidence of the victim into an opportunity to
                    strike the fatal blow. There is no baser deed in all the annals of crime.</p>
                <p>The shock, the grief of the country, are bitter in the minds of all who saw the
                    dark days, while the President yet hovered between <pb n="XI" xml:id="pg_XI"
                        facs="0011"/>life and death. At last the light was stilled in the kindly
                    eyes and the breath went from the lips that even in mortal agony uttered no
                    words save of forgiveness to his murderer, of love for his friends, and of
                    unfaltering trust in the will of the Most High. Such a death, crowning the glory
                    of such a life, leaves us with infinite sorrow, but with such pride in what he
                    had accomplished and in his own personal character, that we feel the blow not as
                    struck at him, but as struck at the Nation. We mourn a good and great President
                    who is dead; but while we mourn we are lifted up by the splendid achievements of
                    his life and the grand heroism with which he met his death.</p>
                <p>When we turn from the man to the Nation, the harm done is so great as to excite
                    our gravest apprehensions and to demand our wisest and most resolute action.
                    This criminal was a professed anarchist, inflamed by the teachings of professed
                    anarchists, and probably also by the reckless utterances of those who, on the
                    stump and in the public press, appeal to the dark and evil spirits of malice and
                    greed, envy and sullen hatred. The wind is sowed by the men who preach such
                    doctrines, and they cannot escape their share of responsibility for the
                    whirlwind that is reaped. This applies alike to the deliberate demagogue, to the
                    exploiter of sensationalism, and to the crude and foolish visionary who, for
                    whatever reason, apologizes for crime or excites aimless discontent.</p>
                <p>The blow was aimed not at this President, but at all Presidents; at every symbol
                    of government. President McKinley was as emphatically the embodiment of the
                    popular will of the Nation expressed through the forms of law as a New England
                    town meeting is in similar fashion the embodiment of the law-abiding purpose and
                    practice of the people of the town. On no conceivable theory could the murder of
                    the President be accepted as due to protest against “inequalities in the social
                    order,” save as the murder of all the freemen engaged in a town meeting could be
                    accepted as a protest against that social inequality which puts a malefactor in
                    jail. Anarchy is no more an expression of “social discontent” than picking
                    pockets or wife-beating.</p>
                <p>The anarchist, and especially the anarchist in the United States, is merely one
                    type of criminal, more dangerous than any other because he represents the same
                    depravity in a greater degree. The man who advocates anarchy directly or
                    indirectly, in any shape or fashion, or the man who apologizes for anarchists
                    and their deeds, makes himself morally accessory to murder before the fact. The
                        <pb n="XII" xml:id="pg_XII" facs="0012"/>anarchist is a criminal whose
                    perverted instincts lead him to prefer confusion and chaos to the most
                    beneficent form of social order. His protest of concern for workingmen is
                    outrageous in its impudent falsity; for if the political institutions of this
                    country do not afford opportunity to every honest and intelligent son of toil,
                    then the door of hope is forever closed against him. The anarchist is everywhere
                    not merely the enemy of system and of progress, but the deadly foe of liberty.
                    If ever anarchy is triumphant, its triumph will last for but one red moment, to
                    be succeeded for ages by the gloomy night of despotism.</p>
                <p>For the anarchist himself, whether he preaches or practices his doctrines, we
                    need not have one particle more concern than for any ordinary murderer. He is
                    not the victim of social or political injustice. There are no wrongs to remedy
                    in his case. The cause of his criminality is to be found in his own evil
                    passions and in the evil conduct of those who urge him on, not in any failure by
                    others or by the State to do justice to him or his. He is a malefactor and
                    nothing else. He is in no sense, in no shape or way, a “product of social
                    conditions,” save as a highwayman is “produced” by the fact that an unarmed man
                    happens to have a purse. It is a travesty upon the great and holy names of
                    liberty and freedom to permit them to be invoked in such a cause. No man or body
                    of men preaching anarchistic doctrines should be allowed at large any more than
                    if preaching the murder of some specified private individual. Anarchistic
                    speeches, writings, and meetings are essentially seditious and treasonable.</p>
                <p>I earnestly recommend to the Congress that in the exercise of its wise discretion
                    it should take into consideration the coming to this country of anarchists or
                    persons professing principles hostile to all government and justifying the
                    murder of those placed in authority. Such individuals as those who not long ago
                    gathered in open meeting to glorify the murder of King Humbert of Italy
                    perpetrate a crime, and the law should ensure their rigorous punishment. They
                    and those like them should be kept out of this country; and if found here they
                    should be promptly deported to the country whence they came; and far-reaching
                    provision should be made for the punishment of those who stay. No matter calls
                    more urgently for the wisest thought of the Congress.</p>
                <p>The Federal courts should be given jurisdiction over any man who kills or
                    attempts to kill the President or any man who by the Constitution or by law is
                    in line of succession for the Presidency, <pb n="XIII" xml:id="pg_XIII"
                        facs="0013"/>while the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be
                    proportioned to the enormity of the offense against our institutions.</p>
                <p>Anarchy is a crime against the whole human race; and all mankind should band
                    against the anarchist. His crime should be made an offense against the law of
                    nations, like piracy and that form of manstealing known as the slave trade; for
                    it is of far blacker infamy than either. It should be so declared by treaties
                    among all civilized powers. Such treaties would give to the Federal Government
                    the power of dealing with the crime.</p>
                <p>A grim commentary upon the folly of the anarchist position was afforded by the
                    attitude of the law toward this very criminal who had just taken the life of the
                    President. The people would have torn him limb from limb if it had not been that
                    the law he defied was at once invoked in his behalf. So far from his deed being
                    committed on behalf of the people against the Government, the Government was
                    obliged at once to exert its full police power to save him from instant death at
                    the hands of the people. Moreover, his deed worked not the slightest dislocation
                    in our governmental system, and the danger of a recurrence of such deeds, no
                    matter how great it might grow, would work only in the direction of
                    strengthening and giving harshness to the forces of order. No man will ever be
                    restrained from becoming President by any fear as to his personal safety. If the
                    risk to the President’s life became great, it would mean that the office would
                    more and more come to be filled by men of a spirit which would make them
                    resolute and merciless in dealing with every friend of disorder. This great
                    country will not fall into anarchy, and if anarchists should ever become a
                    serious menace to its institutions, they would not merely be stamped out, but
                    would involve in their own ruin every active or passive sympathizer with their
                    doctrines. The American people are slow to wrath, but when their wrath is once
                    kindled it burns like a consuming flame.</p>
                <p>During the last five years business confidence has been restored, and the Nation
                    is to be congratulated because of its present abounding prosperity. Such
                    prosperity can never be created by law alone, although it is easy enough to
                    destroy it by mischievous laws. If the hand of the Lord is heavy upon any
                    country, if flood or drought comes, human wisdom is powerless to avert the
                    calamity. Moreover, no law can guard us against the consequences of our own
                    folly. The men who are idle or credulous, the men who seek gains not by genuine
                    work with head or hand but by gambling in any form, are <pb n="XIV"
                        xml:id="pg_XIV" facs="0014"/>always a source of menace not only to
                    themselves but to others. If the business world loses its head, it loses what
                    legislation cannot supply. Fundamentally the welfare of each citizen, and
                    therefore the welfare of the aggregate of citizens which makes the Nation, must
                    rest upon individual thrift and energy, resolution and intelligence. Nothing can
                    take the place of this individual capacity; but wise legislation and honest and
                    intelligent administration can give it the fullest scope, the largest
                    opportunity to work to good effect.</p>
                <p>The tremendous and highly complex industrial development which went on with ever
                    accelerated rapidity during the latter half of the nineteenth century brings us
                    face to face, at the beginning of the twentieth, with very serious social
                    problems. The old laws, and the old customs which had almost the binding force
                    of law, were once quite sufficient to regulate the accumulation and distribution
                    of wealth. Since the industrial changes which have so enormously increased the
                    productive power of mankind, they are no longer sufficient.</p>
                <p>The growth of cities has gone on beyond comparison faster than the growth of the
                    country, and the upbuilding of the great industrial centers has meant a
                    startling increase, not merely in the aggregate of wealth, but in the number of
                    very large individual, and especially of very large corporate, fortunes. The
                    creation of these great corporate fortunes has not been due to the tariff nor to
                    any other governmental action, but to natural causes in the business world,
                    operating in other countries as they operate in our own.</p>
                <p>The process has aroused much antagonism, a great part of which is wholly without
                    warrant. It is not true that as the rich have grown richer the poor have grown
                    poorer. On the contrary, never before has the average man, the wage-worker, the
                    farmer, the small trader, been so well off as in this country and at the present
                    time. There have, been abuses connected with the accumulation of wealth; yet it
                    remains true that a fortune accumulated in legitimate business can be
                    accumulated by the person specially benefited only on condition of conferring
                    immense incidental benefits upon others. Successful enterprise, of the type
                    which benefits all mankind, can only exist if the conditions are such as to
                    offer great prizes as the rewards of success.</p>
                <p>The captains of industry who have driven the railway systems across this
                    continent, who have built up our commerce, who have developed our manufactures,
                    have on the whole done great good <pb n="XV" xml:id="pg_XV" facs="0015"/>to our
                    people. Without them the material development of which we are so justly proud
                    could never have taken place. Moreover, we should recognize the immense
                    importance to this material development of leaving as unhampered as is
                    compatible with the public good the strong and forceful men upon whom the
                    success of business operations inevitably rests. The slightest study of business
                    conditions will satisfy anyone capable of forming a judgment that the personal
                    equation is the most important factor in a business operation; that the business
                    ability of the man at the head of any business concern, big or little, is
                    usually the factor which fixes the gulf between striking success and hopeless
                    failure.</p>
                <p>An additional reason for caution in dealing with corporations is to be found in
                    the international commercial conditions of to-day. The same business conditions
                    which have produced the great aggregations of corporate and individual wealth
                    have made them very potent factors in international commercial competition.
                    Business concerns which have the largest means at their disposal and are managed
                    by the ablest men are naturally those which take the lead in the strife for
                    commercial supremacy among the nations of the world. America has only just begun
                    to assume that commanding position in the international business world which we
                    believe will more and more be hers. It is of the utmost importance that this
                    position be not jeoparded, especially at a time when the overflowing abundance
                    of our own natural resources and the skill, business energy, and mechanical
                    aptitude of our people make foreign markets essential. Under such conditions it
                    would be most unwise to cramp or to fetter the youthful strength of our
                    Nation.</p>
                <p>Moreover, it cannot too often be pointed out that to strike with ignorant
                    violence at the interests of one set of men almost inevitably endangers the
                    interests of all. The fundamental rule in our national life—the rule which
                    underlies all others—is that, on the whole, and in the long run, we shall go up
                    or down together. There are exceptions; and in times of prosperity some will
                    prosper far more, and in times of adversity some will suffer far more, than
                    others; but speaking generally, a period of good times means that all share more
                    or less in them, and in a period of hard times all feel the stress to a greater
                    or less degree. It surely ought not to be necessary to enter into any proof of
                    this statement; the memory of the lean years which began in 1893 still vivid,
                    and we can contrast them with the conditions in this very year which is now
                    closing. Disaster to great business enterprises can never have its effects
                    limited <pb n="XVI" xml:id="pg_XVI" facs="0016"/>to the men at the top. It
                    spreads throughout, and while it is bad for everybody, it is worst for those
                    farthest down. The capitalist may be shorn of his luxuries; but the wage-worker
                    may be deprived of even bare necessities.</p>
                <p>The mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must be taken
                    not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance. Many of those who
                    have made it their vocation to denounce the great industrial combinations which
                    are popularly, although with technical inaccuracy, known as “trusts,” appeal
                    especially to hatred and fear. These are precisely the two emotions,
                    particularly when combined with ignorance, which unfit men for the exercise of
                    cool and steady judgment. In facing new industrial conditions, the whole history
                    of the world shows that legislation will generally be both unwise and
                    ineffective unless undertaken after calm inquiry and with sober self-restraint.
                    Much of the legislation directed at the trusts would have been exceedingly
                    mischievous had it not also been entirely ineffective. In accordance with a
                    well-known sociological law, the ignorant or reckless agitator has been the
                    really effective friend of the evils which he has been nominally opposing. In
                    dealing with business interests, for the Government to undertake by crude and
                    ill-considered legislation to do what may turn out to be bad, would be to incur
                    the risk of such far-reaching national disaster that it would be preferable to
                    undertake nothing at all. The men who demand the impossible or the undesirable
                    serve as the allies of the forces with which they are nominally at war, for they
                    hamper those who would endeavor to find out in rational fashion what the wrongs
                    really are and to what extent and in what manner it is practicable to apply
                    remedies.</p>
                <p>All this is true; and yet it is also true that there are real and grave evils,
                    one of the chief being over-capitalization because of its many baleful
                    consequences; and a resolute and practical effort must be made to correct these
                    evils.</p>
                <p>There is a widespread conviction in the minds of the American people that the
                    great corporations known as trusts are in certain of their features and
                    tendencies hurtful to the general welfare. This springs from no spirit of envy
                    or uncharitableness, nor lack of pride in the great industrial achievements that
                    have placed this country at the head of the nations struggling for commercial
                    supremacy. It does not rest upon a lack of intelligent appreciation of the
                    necessity of meeting changing and changed conditions of trade with new methods,
                    nor upon ignorance of the fact that combination of capital <pb n="XVII"
                        xml:id="pg_XVII" facs="0017"/>in the effort to accomplish great things is
                    necessary when the world’s progress demands that great things be done. It is
                    based upon sincere conviction that combination and concentration should be, not
                    prohibited, but supervised and within reasonable limits controlled; and in my
                    judgment this conviction is right.</p>
                <p>It is no limitation upon property rights or freedom of contract to require that
                    when men receive from Government the privilege of doing business under corporate
                    form, which frees them from individual responsibility, and enables them to call
                    into their enterprises the capital of the public, they shall do so upon
                    absolutely truthful representations as to the value of the property in which the
                    capital is to be invested. Corporations engaged in interstate commerce should be
                    regulated if they are found to exercise a license working to the public injury.
                    It should be as much the aim of those who seek for social betterment to rid the
                    business world of crimes of cunning as to rid the entire body politic of crimes
                    of violence. Great corporations exist only because they are created and
                    safeguarded by our institutions; and it is therefore our right and our duty to
                    see that they work in harmony with these institutions.</p>
                <p>The first essential in determining how to deal with the great industrial
                    combinations is knowledge of the facts—publicity. In the interest of the public,
                    the Government should have the right to inspect and examine the workings of the
                    great corporations engaged in interstate business. Publicity is the only sure
                    remedy which we can now invoke. What further remedies are needed in the way of
                    governmental regulation, or taxation, can only be determined after publicity has
                    been obtained, by process of law, and in the course of administration. The first
                    requisite is knowledge, full and complete—knowledge which may be made public to
                    the world.</p>
                <p>Artificial bodies, such as corporations and joint stock or other associations,
                    depending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges, should be
                    subject to proper governmental supervision, and full and accurate information as
                    to their operations should be made public regularly at reasonable intervals.</p>
                <p>The large corporations, commonly called trusts, though organized in one State,
                    always do business in many States, often doing very little business in the State
                    where they are incorporated. There is utter lack of uniformity in the State laws
                    about them; and as no State has any exclusive interest in or power over their
                    acts, it has in practice proved impossible to get adequate regulation through
                    State action. Therefore, in the interest of the whole people, the Nation <pb
                        n="XVIII" xml:id="pg_XVIII" facs="0018"/>should, without interfering with
                    the power of the States in the matter itself, also assume power of supervision
                    and regulation over all corporations doing an interstate business. This is
                    especially true where the corporation derives a portion of its wealth from the
                    existence of some monopolistic element or tendency in its business. There would
                    be no hardship in such supervision; banks are subject to it, and in their case
                    it is now accepted as a simple matter of course. Indeed, it is probable that
                    supervision of corporations by the National Government need not go so far as is
                    now the case with the supervision exercised over them by so conservative a State
                    as Massachusetts, in order to produce excellent results.</p>
                <p>When the Constitution was adopted, at the end of the eighteenth century, no human
                    wisdom could foretell the sweeping changes, alike in industrial and political
                    conditions, which were to take place by the beginning of the twentieth century.
                    At that time it was accepted as a matter of course that the several States were
                    the proper authorities to regulate, so far as was then necessary, the
                    comparatively insignificant and strictly localized corporate bodies of the day.
                    The conditions are now wholly different and wholly different action is called
                    for. I believe that a law can be framed which will enable the National
                    Government to exercise control along the lines above indicated; profiting by the
                    experience gained through the passage and administration of the
                    Interstate-Commerce Act. If, however, the judgment of the Congress is that it
                    lacks the constitutional power to pass such an act, then a constitutional
                    amendment should be submitted to confer the power.</p>
                <p>There should be created a Cabinet officer, to be known as Secretary of Commerce
                    and Industries, as provided in the bill introduced at the last session of the
                    Congress. It should be his province to deal with commerce in its broadest sense;
                    including among many other things whatever concerns labor and all matters
                    affecting the great business corporations and our merchant marine.</p>
                <p>The course proposed is one phase of what should be a comprehensive and
                    far-reaching scheme of constructive statesmanship for the purpose of broadening
                    our markets, securing our business interests on a safe basis, and making firm
                    our new position in the international industrial world; while scrupulously
                    safeguarding the rights of wage-worker and capitalist, of investor and private
                    citizen, so as to secure equity as between man and man in this Republic.</p>
                <p>With the sole exception of the farming interest, no one matter is of such vital
                    moment to our whole people as the welfare of the <pb n="XIX" xml:id="pg_XIX"
                        facs="0019"/>wage-workers. If the farmer and the wage-worker are well off,
                    it is absolutely certain that all others will be well off too. It is therefore a
                    matter for hearty congratulation that on the whole wages are higher to-day in
                    the United States than ever before in our history, and far higher than in any
                    other country. The standard of living is also higher than ever before. Every
                    effort of legislator and administrator should be bent to secure the permanency
                    of this condition of things and its improvement wherever possible. Not only must
                    our labor be protected by the tariff, but it should also be protected so far as
                    it is possible from the presence in this country of any laborers brought over by
                    contract, or of those who, coming freely, yet represent a standard of living so
                    depressed that they can undersell our men in the labor market and drag them to a
                    lower level. I regard it as necessary, with this end in view, to re-enact
                    immediately the law excluding Chinese laborers and to strengthen it wherever
                    necessary in order to make its enforcement entirely effective.</p>
                <p>The National Government should demand the highest quality of service from its
                    employees; and in return it should be a good employer. If possible legislation
                    should be passed, in connection with the Interstate Commerce Law, which will
                    render effective the efforts of different States to do away with the competition
                    of convict contract labor in the open labor market. So far as practicable under
                    the conditions of Government work, provision should be made to render the
                    enforcement of the eight-hour law easy and certain. In all industries carried on
                    directly or indirectly for the United States Government women and children
                    should be protected from excessive hours of labor, from night work, and from
                    work under unsanitary conditions. The Government should provide in its contracts
                    that all work should be done under “fair” conditions, and in addition to setting
                    a high standard should uphold it by proper inspection, extending if necessary to
                    the subcontractors. The Government should forbid all night work for women and
                    children, as well as excessive overtime. For the District of Columbia a good
                    factory law should be passed; and, as a powerful indirect aid to such laws,
                    provision should be made to turn the inhabited alleys, the existence of which is
                    a reproach to our Capital City, into minor streets, where the inhabitants can
                    live under conditions favorable to health and morals.</p>
                <p>American wage-workers work with their heads as well as their hands. Moreover,
                    they take a keen pride in what they are doing; <pb n="XX" xml:id="pg_XX"
                        facs="0020"/>so that, independent of the reward, they wish to turn out a
                    perfect job. This is the great secret of our success in competition with the
                    labor of foreign countries.</p>
                <p>The most vital problem with which this country, and for that matter the whole
                    civilized world, has to deal, is the problem which has for one side the
                    betterment of social conditions, moral and physical, in large cities, and for
                    another side the effort to deal with that tangle of far-reaching questions which
                    we group together when we speak of “labor.” The chief factor in the success of
                    each man—wage-worker, farmer, and capitalist alike—must ever be the sum total of
                    his own individual qualities and abilities. Second only to this comes the power
                    of acting in combination or association with others. Very great good has been
                    and will be accomplished by associations or unions of wage-workers, when managed
                    with forethought, and when they combine insistence upon their own rights with
                    law-abiding respect for the rights of others. The display of these qualities in
                    such bodies is a duty to the Nation no less than to the associations themselves.
                    Finally, there must also in many cases be action by the Government in order to
                    safeguard the rights and interests of all. Under our Constitution there is much
                    more scope for such action by the State and the municipality than by the Nation.
                    But on points such as those touched on above the National Government can
                    act.</p>
                <p>When all is said and done, the rule of brotherhood remains as the indispensable
                    prerequisite to success in the kind of national life for which we strive. Each
                    man must work for himself, and unless he so works no outside help can avail him;
                    but each man must remember also that he is indeed his brother’s keeper, and that
                    while no man who refuses to walk can be carried with advantage to himself or
                    anyone else, yet that each at times stumbles or halts, that each at times needs
                    to have the helping hand outstretched to him. To be permanently effective, aid
                    must always take the form of helping a man to help himself; and we can all best
                    help ourselves by joining together in the work that is of common interest to
                    all.</p>
                <p>Our present immigration laws are unsatisfactory. We need every honest and
                    efficient immigrant fitted to become an American citizen, every immigrant who
                    comes here to stay, who brings here a strong body, a stout heart, a good head,
                    and a resolute purpose to do his duty well in every way and to bring up his
                    children as law-abiding and God-fearing members of the community. But there
                    should be a comprehensive law enacted with the object of working <pb n="XXI"
                        xml:id="pg_XXI" facs="0021"/>a threefold improvement over our present
                    system. First, we should aim to exclude absolutely not only all persons who are
                    known to be believers in anarchistic principles or members of anarchistic
                    societies, but also all persons who are of a low moral tendency or of unsavory
                    reputation. This means that we should require a more thorough system of
                    inspection abroad and a more rigid system of examination at our immigration
                    ports, the former being especially necessary.</p>
                <p>The second object of a proper immigration law ought to be to secure by a careful
                    and not merely perfunctory educational test some intelligent capacity to
                    appreciate American institutions and act sanely as American citizens. This would
                    not keep out all anarchists, for many of them belong to the intelligent criminal
                    class. But it would do what is also in point, that is, tend to decrease the sum
                    of ignorance, so potent in producing the envy, suspicion, malignant passion, and
                    hatred of order, out of which anarchistic sentiment inevitably springs. Finally,
                    all persons should be excluded who are below a certain standard of economic
                    fitness to enter our industrial field as competitors with American labor. There
                    should be proper proof of personal capacity to earn an American living and
                    enough money to insure a decent start under American conditions. This would stop
                    the influx of cheap labor, and the resulting competition which gives rise to so
                    much of bitterness in American industrial life; and it would dry up the springs
                    of the pestilential social conditions in our great cities, where anarchistic
                    organizations have their greatest possibility of growth.</p>
                <p>Both the educational and economic tests in a wise immigration law should be
                    designed to protect and elevate the general body politic and social. A very
                    close supervision should be exercised over the steamship companies which mainly
                    bring over the immigrants, and they should be held to a strict accountability
                    for any infraction of the law.</p>
                <p>There is general acquiescence in our present tariff system as a national policy.
                    The first requisite to our prosperity is the continuity and stability of this
                    economic policy. Nothing could be more unwise than to disturb the business
                    interests of the country by any general tariff change at this time. Doubt,
                    apprehension, uncertainty are exactly what we most wish to avoid in the interest
                    of our commercial and material well-being. Our experience in the past has shown
                    that sweeping revisions of the tariff are apt to <pb n="XXII" xml:id="pg_XXII"
                        facs="0022"/>produce conditions closely approaching panic in the business
                    world. Yet it is not only possible, but eminently desirable, to combine with the
                    stability of our economic system a supplementary system of reciprocal benefit
                    and obligation with other nations. Such reciprocity is an incident and result of
                    the firm establishment and preservation of our present economic policy. It was
                    specially provided for in the present tariff law.</p>
                <p>Reciprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protection. Our first duty is to
                    see that the protection granted by the tariff in every case where it is needed
                    is maintained, and that reciprocity be sought for so far as it can safely be
                    done without injury to our home industries. Just how far this is must be
                    determined according to the individual case, remembering always that every
                    application of our tariff policy to meet our shifting national needs must be
                    conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties must never be reduced below
                    the point that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad.
                    The well-being of the wage-worker is a prime consideration of our entire policy
                    of economic legislation.</p>
                <p>Subject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to our industrial
                    well-being at home, the principle of reciprocity must command our hearty
                    support. The phenomenal growth of our export trade emphasizes the urgency of the
                    need for wider markets and for a liberal policy in dealing with foreign nations.
                    Whatever is merely petty and vexatious in the way of trade restrictions should
                    be avoided. The customers to whom we dispose of our surplus products in the long
                    run, directly or indirectly, purchase those surplus products by giving us
                    something in return. Their ability to purchase our products should as far as
                    possible be secured by so arranging our tariff as to enable us to take from them
                    those products which we can use without harm to our own industries and labor, or
                    the use of which will be of marked benefit to us.</p>
                <p>It is most important that we should maintain the high level of our present
                    prosperity. We have now reached the point in the development of our interests
                    where we are not only able to supply our own markets but to produce a constantly
                    growing surplus for which we must find markets abroad. To secure these markets
                    we can utilize existing duties in any case where they are no longer needed for
                    the purpose of protection, or in any case where the article is not produced here
                    and the duty is no longer necessary for revenue, as giving us something to offer
                    in exchange for what we <pb n="XXIII" xml:id="pg_XXIII" facs="0023"/>ask. The
                    cordial relations with other nations which are so desirable will naturally be
                    promoted by the course thus required by our own interests.</p>
                <p>The natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be in connection
                    with those of our productions which no longer require all of the support once
                    needed to establish them upon a sound basis, and with those others where either
                    because of natural or of economic causes we are beyond the reach of successful
                    competition.</p>
                <p>I ask the attention of the Senate to the reciprocity treaties laid before it by
                    my predecessor.</p>
                <p>The condition of the American merchant marine is such as to call for immediate
                    remedial action by the Congress. It is discreditable to us as a Nation that our
                    merchant marine should be utterly insignificant in comparison to that of other
                    nations which we overtop in other forms of business. We should not longer submit
                    to conditions under which only a trifling portion of our great commerce is
                    carried in our own ships. To remedy this state of things would not merely serve
                    to build up our shipping interests, but it would also result in benefit to all
                    who are interested in the permanent establishment of a wider market for American
                    products, and would provide an auxiliary force for the Navy. Ships work for
                    their own countries just as railroads work for their terminal points. Shipping
                    lines, if established to the principal countries with which we have dealings,
                    would be of political as well as commercial benefit. From every standpoint it is
                    unwise for the United States to continue to rely upon the ships of competing
                    nations for the distribution of our goods. It should be made advantageous to
                    carry American goods in American-built ships.</p>
                <p>At present American shipping is under certain great disadvantages when put in
                    competition with the shipping of foreign countries. Many of the fast foreign
                    steamships, at a speed of fourteen knots or above, are subsidized; and all our
                    ships, sailing vessels and steamers alike, cargo carriers of slow speed and mail
                    carriers of high speed, have to meet the fact that the original cost of building
                    American ships is greater than is the case abroad; that the wages paid American
                    officers and seamen are very much higher than those paid the officers and seamen
                    of foreign competing countries; and that the standard of living on our ships is
                    far superior to the standard of living on the ships of our commercial
                    rivals.</p>
                <pb n="XXIV" xml:id="pg_XXIV" facs="0024"/>
                <p>Our Government should take such action as will remedy these inequalities. The
                    American merchant marine should be restored to the ocean.</p>
                <p>The Act of March 14, 1900, intended unequivocally to establish gold as the
                    standard money and to maintain at a parity therewith all forms of money medium
                    in use with us, has been shown to be timely and judicious. The price of our
                    Government bonds in the world’s market, when compared with the price of similar
                    obligations issued by other nations, is a flattering tribute to our public
                    credit. This condition it is evidently desirable to maintain.</p>
                <p>In many respects the National Banking Law furnishes sufficient liberty for the
                    proper exercise of the banking function; but there seems to be need of better
                    safeguards against the deranging influence of commercial crises and financial
                    panics. Moreover, the currency of the country should be made responsive to the
                    demands of our domestic trade and commerce.</p>
                <p>The collections from duties on imports and internal taxes continue to exceed the
                    ordinary expenditures of the Government, thanks mainly to the reduced army
                    expenditures. The utmost care should be taken not to reduce the revenues so that
                    there will be any possibility of a deficit; but, after providing against any
                    such contingency, means should be adopted which will bring the revenues more
                    nearly within the limit of our actual needs. In his report to the Congress the
                    Secretary of the Treasury considers all these questions at length, and I ask
                    your attention to the report and recommendations.</p>
                <p>I call special attention to the need of strict economy in expenditures. The fact
                    that our national needs forbid us to be niggardly in providing whatever is
                    actually necessary to our well-being, should make us doubly careful to husband
                    our national resources, as each of us husbands his private resources, by
                    scrupulous avoidance of anything like wasteful or reckless expenditure. Only by
                    avoidance of spending money on what is needless or unjustifiable can we
                    legitimately keep our income to the point required to meet our needs that are
                    genuine.</p>
                <p>In 1887 a measure was enacted for the regulation of interstate railways, commonly
                    known as the Interstate Commerce Act. The cardinal provisions of that act were
                    that railway rates should be just and reasonable and that all shippers,
                    localities, and commodities should be accorded equal treatment. A commission was
                    created <pb n="XXV" xml:id="pg_XXV" facs="0025"/>and endowed with what were
                    supposed to be the necessary powers to execute the provisions of this act.</p>
                <p>That law was largely an experiment. Experience has shown the wisdom of its
                    purposes, but has also shown, possibly that some of its requirements are wrong,
                    certainly that the means devised for the enforcement of its provisions are
                    defective. Those who complain of the management of the railways allege that
                    established rates are not maintained; that rebates and similar devices are
                    habitually resorted to; that these preferences are usually in favor of the large
                    shipper; that they drive out of business the smaller competitor; that while many
                    rates are too low, many others are excessive; and that gross preferences are
                    made, affecting both localities and commodities. Upon the other hand, the
                    railways assert that the law by its very terms tends to produce many of these
                    illegal practices by depriving carriers of that right of concerted action which
                    they claim is necessary to establish and maintain non-discriminating rates.</p>
                <p>The act should be amended. The railway is a public servant. Its rates should be
                    just to and open to all shippers alike. The Government should see to it that
                    within its jurisdiction this is so and should provide a speedy, inexpensive, and
                    effective remedy to that end. At the same time it must not be forgotten that our
                    railways are the arteries through which the commercial lifeblood of this Nation
                    flows. Nothing could be more foolish than the enactment of legislation which
                    would unnecessarily interfere with the development and operation of these
                    commercial agencies. The subject is one of great importance and calls for the
                    earnest attention of the Congress.</p>
                <p>The Department of Agriculture during the past fifteen years has steadily
                    broadened its work on economic lines, and has accomplished results of real value
                    in upbuilding domestic and foreign trade. It has gone into new fields until it
                    is now in touch with all sections of our country and with two of the island
                    groups that have lately come under our jurisdiction, whose people must look to
                    agriculture as a livelihood. It is searching the world for grains, grasses,
                    fruits, and vegetables specially fitted for introduction into localities in the
                    several States and Territories where they may add materially to our resources.
                    By scientific attention to soil survey and possible new crops, to breeding of
                    new varieties of plants, to experimental shipments, to animal industry and
                    applied chemistry, very practical aid has been given our farming and
                    stock-growing interests. The <pb n="XXVI" xml:id="pg_XXVI" facs="0026"/>products
                    of the farm have taken an unprecedented place in our export trade during the
                    year that has just closed.</p>
                <p>Public opinion throughout the United States has moved steadily toward a just
                    appreciation of the value of forests, whether planted or of natural growth. The
                    great part played by them in the creation and maintenance of the national wealth
                    is now more fully realized than ever before.</p>
                <p>Wise forest protection does not mean the withdrawal of forest resources, whether
                    of wood, water, or grass, from contributing their full share to the welfare of
                    the people, but, on the contrary, gives the assurance of larger and more certain
                    “supplies. The fundamental idea of forestry is the perpetuation of forests by
                    use. Forest protection is not an end of itself; it is a means to increase and
                    sustain the resources of our country and the industries which depend upon them.
                    The preservation of our forests is an imperative business necessity. We have
                    come to see clearly that whatever destroys the forest, except to make way for
                    agriculture, threatens our well-being.</p>
                <p>The practical usefulness of the national forest reserves to the mining, grazing,
                    irrigation, and other interests of the regions in which the reserves lie has led
                    to a widespread demand by the people of the West for their protection and
                    extension. The forest reserves will inevitably be of still greater use in the
                    future than in the past. Additions should be made to them whenever practicable,
                    and their usefulness should be increased by a thoroughly business-like
                    management.</p>
                <p>At present the protection of the forest reserves rests with the General Land
                    Office, the mapping and description of their timber with the United States
                    Geological Survey, and the preparation of plans for their conservative use with
                    the Bureau of Forestry, which is also charged with the general advancement of
                    practical forestry in the United States. These various functions should be
                    united in the Bureau of Forestry, to which they properly belong. The present
                    diffusion of responsibility is bad from every standpoint. It prevents that
                    effective cooperation between the Government and the men who utilize the
                    resources of the reserves, without which the interests of both must suffer. The
                    scientific bureaus generally should be put under the Department of Agriculture.
                    The President should have by law the power of transferring lands for use as
                    forest reserves to the Department of Agriculture. He already has such power in
                    the case of lands needed by the Departments of War and the Navy.</p>
                <pb n="XXVII" xml:id="pg_XXVII" facs="0027"/>
                <p>The wise administration of the forest reserves will be not less helpful to the
                    interests which depend on water than to those which depend on wood and grass.
                    The water supply itself depends upon the forest. In the arid region it is water,
                    not land, which measures production. The western half of the United States would
                    sustain a population greater than that of our whole country to-day if the waters
                    that now run to waste were saved and used for irrigation. The forest and water
                    problems are perhaps the most vital internal questions of the United States.</p>
                <p>Certain of the forest reserves should also be made preserves for the wild forest
                    creatures. All of the reserves should be better protected from fires. Many of
                    them need special protection because of the great injury done by live stock,
                    above all by sheep. The increase in deer, elk, and other animals in the
                    Yellowstone Park shows what may be expected when other mountain forests are
                    properly protected by law and properly guarded. Some of these areas have been so
                    denuded of surface vegetation by overgrazing that the ground breeding birds,
                    including grouse and quail, and many mammals, including deer, have been
                    exterminated or driven away. At the same time the water-storing capacity of the
                    surface has been decreased or destroyed, thus promoting floods in times of rain
                    and diminishing the flow of streams between rains.</p>
                <p>In cases where natural conditions have been restored for a few years, vegetation
                    has again carpeted the ground, birds and deer are coming back, and hundreds of
                    persons, especially from the immediate neighborhood, come each summer to enjoy
                    the privilege of camping. Some at least of the forest reserves should afford
                    perpetual protection to the native fauna and flora, safe havens of refuge to our
                    rapidly diminishing wild animals of the larger kinds, and free camping grounds
                    for the ever-increasing numbers of men and women who have learned to find rest,
                    health, and recreation in the splendid forests and flower-clad meadows of our
                    mountains. The forest reserves should be set apart forever for the use and
                    benefit of our people as a whole and not sacrificed to the shortsighted greed of
                    a few.</p>
                <p>The forests are natural reservoirs. By restraining the streams in flood and
                    replenishing them in drought they make possible the use of waters otherwise
                    wasted. They prevent the soil from washing, and so protect the storage
                    reservoirs from filling up with silt. Forest conservation, is therefore an
                    essential condition of water conservation.</p>
                <pb n="XXVIII" xml:id="pg_XXVIII" facs="0028"/>
                <p>The forests alone cannot, however, fully regulate and conserve the waters of the
                    arid region. Great storage works are necessary to equalize the flow of streams
                    and to save the flood waters. Their construction has been conclusively shown to
                    be an undertaking too vast for private effort. Nor can it be best accomplished
                    by the individual States acting alone. Far-reaching interstate problems are
                    involved; and the resources of single States would often be inadequate. It is
                    properly a national function, at least in some of its features. It is as right
                    for the National Government to make the streams and rivers of the arid region
                    useful by engineering works for water storage as to make useful the rivers and
                    harbors of the humid region by engineering works of another kind. The storing of
                    the floods in reservoirs at the headwaters of our rivers is but an enlargement
                    of our present policy of river control, under which levees are built on the
                    lower reaches of the same streams.</p>
                <p>The Government should construct and maintain these reservoirs as it does other
                    public works. Where their purpose is to regulate the flow of streams, the water
                    should be turned freely into the channels in the dry season to take the same
                    course under the same laws as the natural flow.</p>
                <p>The reclamation of the unsettled arid public lands presents a different problem.
                    Here it is not enough to regulate the flow of streams. The object of the
                    Government is to dispose of the land to settlers who will build homes upon it.
                    To accomplish this object water must be brought within their reach.</p>
                <p>The pioneer settlers on the arid public domain chose their homes along streams
                    from which they could themselves divert the water to reclaim their holdings.
                    Such opportunities are practically gone. There remain, however, vast areas of
                    public land which can be made available for homestead settlement, but only by
                    reservoirs and main-line canals impracticable for private enterprise. These
                    irrigation works should be built by the National Government. The lands reclaimed
                    by them should be reserved by the Government for actual settlers, and the cost
                    of construction should so far as possible be repaid by the land reclaimed. The
                    distribution of the water, the division of the streams among irrigators, should
                    be left to the settlers themselves in conformity with State laws and without
                    interference with those laws or with vested rights. The policy of the National
                    Government should be to aid irrigation in the several States and Territories in
                    such manner as will enable the people in the local communities to help
                    themselves, and as will stimulate <pb n="XXIX" xml:id="pg_XXIX" facs="0029"
                    />needed reforms in the State laws and regulations governing irrigation.</p>
                <p>The reclamation and settlement of the arid lands will enrich every portion of our
                    country, just as the settlement of the Ohio and Mississippi valleys brought
                    prosperity to the Atlantic States. The increased demand for manufactured
                    articles will stimulate industrial production, while wider home markets and the
                    trade of Asia will consume the larger food supplies and effectually prevent
                    Western competition with Eastern agriculture. Indeed, the products of irrigation
                    will be consumed chiefly in upbuilding local centers of mining and other
                    industries, which would otherwise not come into existence at all. Our people as
                    a whole will profit, for successful home-making is but another name for the
                    upbuilding of the Nation.</p>
                <p>The necessary foundation has already been laid for the inauguration of the policy
                    just described. It would be unwise to begin by doing too much, for a great deal
                    will doubtless be learned, both as to what can and what cannot be safely
                    attempted, by the early efforts, which must of necessity be partly experimental
                    in character. At the very beginning the Government should make clear, beyond
                    shadow of doubt, its intention to pursue this policy on lines of the broadest
                    public interest. No reservoir or canal should ever be built to satisfy selfish
                    personal or local interests; but only in accordance with the advice of trained
                    experts, after long investigation has shown the locality where all the
                    conditions combine to make the work most needed and fraught with the greatest
                    usefulness to the community as a whole. There should be no extravagance, and the
                    believers in the need of irrigation will most benefit their cause by seeing to
                    it that it is free from the least taint of excessive or reckless expenditure of
                    the public moneys.</p>
                <p>Whatever the Nation does for the extension of irrigation should harmonize with,
                    and tend to improve, the condition of those now living on irrigated land. We are
                    not at the starting point of this development. Over two hundred millions of
                    private capital has already been expended in the construction of irrigation
                    works, and many million acres of arid land reclaimed. A high degree of
                    enterprise and ability has been shown in the work itself; but as much cannot be
                    said in reference to the laws relating thereto. The security and value of the
                    homes created depend largely on the stability of titles to water; but the
                    majority of these rest on the uncertain foundation of court decisions rendered
                    in ordinary suits at law. With a few creditable exceptions, the arid States have
                    failed to <pb n="XXX" xml:id="pg_XXX" facs="0030"/>provide for the certain and
                    just division of streams in times of scarcity. Lax and uncertain laws have made
                    it possible to establish rights to water in excess of actual uses or
                    necessities, and many streams have already passed into private ownership, or a
                    control equivalent to ownership.</p>
                <p>Whoever controls a stream practically controls the land it renders productive,
                    and the doctrine of private ownership of water apart from land cannot prevail
                    without causing enduring wrong. The recognition of such ownership, which has
                    been permitted to grow up in the arid regions, should give way to a more
                    enlightened and larger recognition of the rights of the public in the control
                    and disposal of the public water supplies. Laws founded upon conditions
                    obtaining in humid regions, where water is too abundant to justify hoarding it,
                    have no proper application in a dry country.</p>
                <p>In the arid States the only right to water which should be recognized is that of
                    use. In irrigation this right should attach to the land reclaimed and be
                    inseparable therefrom. Granting perpetual water rights to others than users,
                    without compensation to the public, is open to all the objections which apply to
                    giving away perpetual franchises to the public utilities of cities. A few of the
                    Western States have already recognized this, and have incorporated in their
                    constitutions the doctrine of perpetual State ownership of water.</p>
                <p>The benefits which have followed the unaided development of the past justify the
                    Nation’s aid and cooperation in the more difficult and important work yet to be
                    accomplished. Laws so vitally affecting homes as those which control the water
                    supply will only be effective when they have the sanction of the irrigators;
                    reforms can only be final and satisfactory when they come through the
                    enlightenment of the people most concerned. The larger development which
                    national aid insures should, however, awaken in every arid State the
                    determination to make its irrigation system equal in justice and effectiveness
                    that of any country in the civilized world. Nothing could be more unwise than
                    for isolated communities to continue to learn everything experimentally, instead
                    of profiting by what is already known elsewhere. We are dealing with a new and
                    momentous question, in the pregnant years while institutions are forming, and
                    what we do will affect not only the present but future generations.</p>
                <p>Our aim should be not simply to reclaim the largest area of land and provide
                    homes for the largest number of people, but to create <pb n="XXXI"
                        xml:id="pg_XXXI" facs="0031"/>for this new industry the best possible social
                    and industrial conditions; and this requires that we not only understand the
                    existing situation, but avail ourselves of the best experience of the time in
                    the solution of its problems. A careful study should be made, both by the Nation
                    and the States, of the irrigation laws and conditions ehre and abroad.
                    Ultimately it will probably be necessary for the Nation to cooperate with the
                    several arid States in proportion as these States by their legislation and
                    administration show themselves fit to receive it.</p>
                <p>In Hawaii our aim must be to develop the Territory on the traditional American
                    lines. We do not wish a region of large estates tilled by cheap labor; we wish a
                    healthy American community of men who themselves till the farms they own. All
                    our legislation for the islands should be shaped with this end in view; the
                    well-being of the average home-maker must afford the true test of the healthy
                    development of the islands. The land policy should as nearly as possible be
                    modeled on our homestead system.</p>
                <p>It is a pleasure to say that it is hardly more necessary to report as to Porto
                    Rico than as to any State or Territory within our continental limits. The island
                    is thriving as never before, and it is being administered efficiently and
                    honestly. Its people are now enjoying liberty and order under the protection of
                    the United States, and upon this fact we congratulate them and ourselves. Their
                    material welfare must be as carefully and jealously considered as the welfare of
                    any other portion of our country. We have given them the great gift of free
                    access for their products to the markets of, the United States. I ask the
                    attention of the Congress to the need of legislation concerning the public lands
                    of Porto Rico.</p>
                <p>In Cuba such progress has been made toward putting the independent government of
                    the island upon a firm footing that before the present session of the Congress
                    closes this will be an accomplished fact. Cuba will then start as her own
                    mistress; and to the beautiful Queen of the Antilles, as she unfolds this new
                    page of her destiny, we extend our heartiest greetings and good wishes.
                    Elsewhere I have discussed the question of reciprocity. In the case of Cuba,
                    however, there are weighty reasons of morality and of national interest why the
                    policy should be held to have a peculiar application, and I most earnestly ask
                    your attention to the wisdom, indeed to the vital need, of providing for a
                    substantial reduction in the tariff duties on Cuban imports into the United
                    States. Cuba has in her constitution <pb n="XXXII" xml:id="pg_XXXII" facs="0032"
                    />affirmed what we desired, that she should stand, in international matters, in
                    closer and more friendly relations with us than with any other power; and we are
                    bound by every consideration of honor and expediency to pass commercial measures
                    in the interest of her material well-being.</p>
                <p>In the Philippines our problem is larger. They are very rich tropical islands,
                    inhabited by many varying tribes, representing widely different stages of
                    progress toward civilization. Our earnest effort is to help these people upward
                    along the stony and difficult path that leads to self-government. We hope to
                    make our administration of the islands honorable to our Nation by making it of
                    the highest benefit to the Filipinos themselves; and as an earnest of what we
                    intend to do, we point to what we have done. Already a greater measure of
                    material prosperity and of governmental honesty and efficiency has been attained
                    in the Philippines than ever before in their history.</p>
                <p>It is no light task for a nation to achieve the temperamental qualities without
                    which the institutions of free government are but an empty mockery. Our people
                    are now successfully governing themselves, because for more than a thousand
                    years they have been slowly fitting themselves, sometimes consciously, sometimes
                    unconsciously, toward this end. What has taken us thirty generations to achieve,
                    we cannot expect to see another race accomplish out of hand, especially when
                    large portions of that race start very far behind the point which our ancestors
                    had reached even thirty generations ago. In dealing with the Philippine people
                    we must show both patience and strength, forbearance and steadfast resolution.
                    Our aim is high. We do not desire to do for the islanders merely what has
                    elsewhere been done for tropic peoples by even the best foreign governments. We
                    hope to do for them what has never before been done for any people of the
                    tropics—to make them fit for self-government after the fashion of the really
                    free nations.</p>
                <p>History may safely be challenged to show a single instance in which a masterful
                    race such as ours, having been forced by the exigencies of war to take
                    possession of an alien land, has behaved to its inhabitants with the
                    disinterested zeal for their progress that our people have shown in the
                    Philippines. To leave the islands at this time would mean that they would fall
                    into a welter of murderous anarchy. Such desertion of duty on our part would be
                    a crime against humanity. The character of Governor Taft and of his associates
                    and subordinates is a proof, if such be needed, of the sincerity of our effort
                    to give the islanders a constantly increasing <pb n="XXXIII" xml:id="pg_XXXIII"
                        facs="0033"/>measure of self-government, exactly as fast as they show
                    themselves fit to exercise it. Since the civil government was established not an
                    appointment has been made in the islands with any reference to considerations of
                    political influence, or to aught else save the fitness of the man and the needs
                    of the service.</p>
                <p>In our anxiety for the welfare and progress of the Philippines, it may be that
                    here and there we have gone too rapidly in giving them local self-government. It
                    is on this side that our error, if any, has been committed. No competent
                    observer, sincerely desirous of finding out the facts and influenced only by a
                    desire for the welfare of the natives, can assert that we have not gone far
                    enough. We have gone to the very verge of safety in hastening the process. To
                    have taken a single step farther or faster in advance would have been folly and
                    weakness, and might well have been crime. We are extremely anxious that the
                    natives shall show the power of governing themselves. We are anxious, first for
                    their sakes, and next, because it relieves us of a great burden. There need not
                    be the slightest fear of our not continuing to give them all the liberty for
                    which they are fit.</p>
                <p>The only fear is lest in our overanxiety we give them a degree of independence
                    for which they are unfit, thereby inviting reaction and disaster. As fast as
                    there is any reasonable hope that in a given district the people can govern
                    themselves, self-government has been given in that district. There is not a
                    locality fitted for self-government which has not received it. But it may well
                    be that in certain cases it will have to be withdrawn because the inhabitants
                    show themselves unfit to exercise it; such instances have already occurred. In
                    other words, there is not the slightest chance of our failing to show a
                    sufficiently humanitarian spirit. The danger comes in the opposite
                    direction.</p>
                <p>There are still troubles ahead in the islands. The insurrection has become an
                    affair of local banditti and marauders, who deserve no higher regard than the
                    brigands of portions of the Old World. Encouragement, direct or indirect, to
                    these insurrectos stands on the same footing as encouragement to hostile Indians
                    in the days when we still had Indian wars. Exactly as our aim is to give to the
                    Indian who remains peaceful the fullest and amplest consideration, but to have
                    it understood that we will show no weakness if he goes on the warpath, so we
                    must make it evident, unless we are false to our own traditions and to the
                    demands of civilization and humanity, that while we will do everything in our
                    power for the Filipino who <pb n="XXXIV" xml:id="pg_XXXIV" facs="0034"/>is
                    peaceful, we will take the sternest measures with the Filipino who follows the
                    path of the insurrecto and the ladrone.</p>
                <p>The heartiest praise is due to large numbers of the natives of the islands for
                    their steadfast loyalty. The Macabebes have been conspicuous for their courage
                    and devotion to the flag. I recommend that the Secretary of War be empowered to
                    take some systematic action in the way of aiding those of these men who are
                    crippled in the service and the families of those who are killed.</p>
                <p>The time has come when there should be additional legislation for the
                    Philippines. Nothing better can be done for the islands than to introduce
                    industrial enterprises. Nothing would benefit them so much as throwing them open
                    to industrial development. The connection between idleness and mischief is
                    proverbial, and the opportunity to do remunerative work is one of the surest
                    preventives of war. Of course no business man will go into the Philippines
                    unless it is to his interest to do so; and it is immensely to the interest of
                    the islands that he should go in. It is therefore necessary that the Congress
                    should pass laws by which the resources of the islands can be developed; so that
                    franchises (for limited terms of years) can be granted to companies doing
                    business in them, and every encouragement be given to the incoming of business
                    men of every kind.</p>
                <p>Not to permit this is to do a wrong to the Philippines. The franchises must be
                    granted and the business permitted only under regulations which will guarantee
                    the islands against any kind of improper exploitation. But the vast natural
                    wealth of the islands must be developed, and the capital willing, to develop it
                    must be given the opportunity. The field must be thrown open to individual
                    enterprise, which has been the real factor in the development of every region
                    over which our flag has flown. It is urgently necessary to enact suitable laws
                    dealing with general transportation, mining, banking, currency, homesteads, and
                    the use and ownership of the lands and timber. These laws will give free play to
                    industrial enterprise; and the commercial development which will surely follow
                    will afford to the people of the islands the best proofs of the sincerity of our
                    desire to aid them.</p>
                <p>I call your attention most earnestly to the crying need of a cable to Hawaii and
                    the Philippines, to be continued from the Philippines to points in Asia. We
                    should not defer a day longer than necessary the construction of such a cable.
                    It is demanded not merely for commercial but for political and military
                    considerations.</p>
                <pb n="XXXV" xml:id="pg_XXXV" facs="0035"/>
                <p>Either the Congress should immediately provide for the construction of a
                    Government cable, or else an arrangement should be made by which like advantages
                    to those accruing from a Government cable may be secured to the Government by
                    contract with a private cable company.</p>
                <p>No single great material work which remains to be undertaken on this continent is
                    of such consequence to the American people as the building of a canal across the
                    Isthmus connecting North and South America. Its importance to the Nation is by
                    no means limited merely to its material effects upon our business prosperity;
                    and yet with view to these effects alone it would be to the last degree
                    important for us immediately to begin it. While its beneficial effects would
                    perhaps be most marked upon the Pacific Coast and the Gulf and South Atlantic
                    States, it would also greatly benefit other sections. It is emphatically a work
                    which it is for the interest of the entire country to begin and complete as soon
                    as possible; it is one of those great works which only a great nation can
                    undertake with prospects of success, and which when done are not only permanent
                    assets in the nation’s material interests, but standing monuments to its
                    constructive ability.</p>
                <p>I am glad to be able to announce to you that our negotiations on this subject
                    with Great Britain, conducted on both sides in a spirit of friendliness and
                    mutual good will and respect, have resulted in my being able to lay before the
                    Senate a treaty which if ratified will enable us to begin preparations for an
                    Isthmian canal at any time, and which guarantees to this Nation every right that
                    it has ever asked in connection with the canal. In this treaty, the old
                    Clayton-Bulwer treaty, so long recognized as inadequate to supply the base for
                    the construction and maintenance of a necessarily American ship canal, is
                    abrogated. It specifically provides that the United States alone shall do the
                    work of building and assume the responsibility of safeguarding the canal and
                    shall regulate its neutral use by all nations on terms of equality without the
                    guaranty or interference of any outside nation from any quarter. The signed
                    treaty will at once be laid before the Senate, and if approved the Congress can
                    then proceed to give effect to the advantages it secures us by providing for the
                    building of the canal.</p>
                <p>The true end of every great and free people should be self-respecting peace; and
                    this Nation most earnestly desires sincere and <pb n="XXXVI" xml:id="pg_XXXVI"
                        facs="0036"/>cordial friendship with all others. Over the entire world, of
                    recent years, wars between the great civilized powers have become less and less
                    frequent. Wars with barbarous or semi-barbarous peoples come in an entirely
                    different category, being merely a most regrettable but necessary international
                    police duty which must be performed for the sake of the welfare of mankind.
                    Peace can only be kept with certainty where both sides wish to keep it; but more
                    and more the civilized peoples are realizing the wicked folly of war and are
                    attaining that condition of just and intelligent regard for the rights of others
                    which will in the end, as we hope and believe, make world-wide peace possible.
                    The peace conference at The Hague gave definite expression to this hope and
                    belief and marked a stride toward their attainment.</p>
                <p>This same peace conference acquiesced in our statement of the Monroe Doctrine as
                    compatible with the purposes and aims of the conference.</p>
                <p>The Monroe Doctrine should be the cardinal feature of the foreign policy of all
                    the nations of the two Americas, as it is of the United States. Just
                    seventy-eight years have passed since President Monroe in his Annual Message
                    announced that “The American continents are henceforth not to be considered as
                    subjects for future colonization by any European power.” In other words, the
                    Monroe Doctrine is a declaration that there must be no territorial
                    aggrandizement by any non-American power at the expense of any American power on
                    American soil. It is in no wise intended as hostile to any nation in the Old
                    World. Still less is it intended to give cover to any aggression by one New
                    World power at the expense of any other. It is simply a step, and a long step,
                    toward assuring the universal peace of the world by securing the possibility of
                    permanent peace on this hemisphere.</p>
                <p>During the past century other influences have established the permanence and
                    independence of the smaller states of Europe. Through the Monroe Doctrine we
                    hope to be able to safeguard like independence and secure like permanence for
                    the lesser among the New World nations.</p>
                <p>This doctrine has nothing to do with the commercial relations of any American
                    power, save that it in truth allows each of them to form such as it desires. In
                    other words, it is really a guaranty of the commercial independence of the
                    Americas. We do not ask under this doctrine for any exclusive commercial
                    dealings with any other American state. We do not guarantee any state against
                    punishment <pb n="XXXVII" xml:id="pg_XXXVII" facs="0037"/>if it misconducts
                    itself, provided that punishment does not take the form of the acquisition of
                    territory by any non-American power.</p>
                <p>Our attitude in Cuba is a sufficient guaranty of our own good faith. We have not
                    the slightest desire to secure any territory at the expense of any of our
                    neighbors. We wish to work with them hand in hand, so that all of us may be
                    uplifted together, and we rejoice over the good fortune of any of them, we
                    gladly hail their material prosperity and political stability, and are concerned
                    and alarmed if any of them fall into industrial or political chaos. We do not
                    wish to see any Old World military power grow up on this continent, or to be
                    compelled to become a military power ourselves. The peoples of the Americas can
                    prosper best if left to work out their own salvation in their own way.</p>
                <p>The work of upbuilding the Navy must be steadily continued. No one point of our
                    policy, foreign or domestic, is more important than this to the honor and
                    material welfare, and above all to the peace, of our Nation in the future.
                    Whether we desire it or not, we must henceforth recognize that we have
                    international duties no less than international rights. Even if our flag were
                    hauled down in the Philippines and Porto Rico, even if we decided not to build
                    the Isthmian Canal, we should need a thoroughly trained Navy of adequate size,
                    or else be prepared definitely and for all time to abandon the idea that our
                    Nation is among those whose sons go down to the sea in ships. Unless our
                    commerce is always to be carried in foreign bottoms, we must have war craft to
                    protect it.</p>
                <p>Inasmuch, however, as the American people have no thought of abandoning the path
                    upon which they have entered, and especially in view of the fact that the
                    building of the Isthmian Canal is fast becoming one of the matters which the
                    whole people are united in demanding, it is imperative that our Navy should be
                    put and kept in the highest state of efficiency, and should be made to answer to
                    our growing needs. So far from being in any way a provocation to war, an
                    adequate and highly trained navy is the best guaranty against war, the cheapest
                    and most effective peace insurance. The cost of building and maintaining such a
                    navy represents the very lightest premium for insuring peace which this Nation
                    can possibly pay.</p>
                <p>Probably no other great nation in the world is so anxious for peace as we are.
                    There is not a single civilized power which has <pb n="XXXVIII"
                        xml:id="pg_XXXVIII" facs="0038"/>anything whatever to fear from
                    aggressiveness on our part. All we want is peace; and toward this end we wish to
                    be able to secure the same respect for our rights from others which we are eager
                    and anxious to extend to their rights in return, to insure fair treatment to us
                    commercially, and to guarantee the safety of the American people.</p>
                <p>Our people intend to abide by the Monroe Doctrine and to insist upon it as the
                    one sure means of securing the peace of the Western Hemisphere. The Navy offers
                    us the only means of making our insistence upon the Monroe Doctrine anything but
                    a subject of derision to whatever nation chooses to disregard it. We desire the
                    peace which comes as of right to the just man armed; not the peace granted on
                    terms of ignominy to the craven and the weakling.</p>
                <p>It is not possible to improvise a navy after war breaks out. The ships must be
                    built and the men trained long in advance. Some auxiliary vessels can be turned
                    into makeshifts which will do in default of any better for the minor work, and a
                    proportion of raw men can be mixed with the highly trained, their shortcomings
                    being made good by the skill of their fellows; but the efficient fighting force
                    of the Navy when pitted against an equal opponent will be found almost
                    exclusively in the war ships that have been regularly built and in the officers
                    and men who through years of faithful performance of sea duty have been trained
                    to handle their formidable but complex and delicate weapons with the highest
                    efficiency. In the late war with Spain the ships that dealt the decisive blows
                    at Manila and Santiago had been launched from two to fourteen years, and they
                    were able to do as they did because the men in the conning towers, the gun
                    turrets, and the engine-rooms had through long-years of practice at sea learned
                    how to do their duty.</p>
                <p>Our present Navy was begun in 1882. At that period our Navy consisted of a
                    collection of antiquated wooden ships, already almost as out of place against
                    modern war vessels as the galleys of Alcibiades and Hamilcar—certainly as the
                    ships of Tromp and Blake. Nor at that time did we have men fit to handle a
                    modern man-of-war. Under the wise legislation of the Congress and the successful
                    administration of a succession of patriotic Secretaries of the Navy, belonging
                    to both political parties, the work of upbuilding the Navy went on, and ships
                    equal to any in the world of their kind were continually added; and what was
                    even more important, these ships were exercised at sea singly and in squadrons
                    until the men aboard them were able to get the best possible service out of
                    them. The result was seen <pb n="XXXIX" xml:id="pg_XXXIX" facs="0039"/>in the
                    short war with Spain, which was decided with such rapidity because of the
                    infinitely greater preparedness of our Navy than of the Spanish Navy.</p>
                <p>While awarding the fullest honor to the men who actually commanded and manned the
                    ships which destroyed the Spanish sea forces in the Philippines and in Cuba, we
                    must not forget that an equal meed of praise belongs to those without whom
                    neither blow could have been struck. The Congressmen who voted years in advance
                    the money to lay down the ships, to build the guns, to buy the armor-plate; the
                    Department officials and the business men and wage-workers who furnished what
                    the Congress had authorized; the Secretaries of the Navy who asked for and
                    expended the appropriations; and finally the officers who, in fair weather and
                    foul, on actual sea service, trained and disciplined the crews of the ships when
                    there was no war in sight—all are entitled to a full share in the glory of
                    Manila and Santiago, and the respect accorded by every true American to those
                    who wrought such signal triumph for our country. It was forethought and
                    preparation which secured us the overwhelming triumph of 1898. If we fail to
                    show forethought and preparation now, there may come a time when disaster will
                    befall us instead of triumph; and should this time come, the fault will rest
                    primarily, not upon those whom the accident of events puts in supreme command at
                    the moment, but upon those who have failed to prepare in advance.</p>
                <p>There should be no cessation in the work of completing our Navy. So far ingenuity
                    has been wholly unable to devise a substitute for the great war craft whose
                    hammering guns beat out the mastery of the high seas. It is unsafe and unwise
                    not to provide this year for several additional battle ships and heavy armored
                    cruisers, with auxiliary and lighter craft in proportion; for the exact numbers
                    and character I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Navy. But there
                    is something we need even more than additional ships, and this is additional
                    officers and men. To provide battle ships and cruisers and then lay them up,
                    with the expectation of leaving them unmanned until they are needed in actual
                    war, would be worse than folly; it would be a crime against the Nation.</p>
                <p>To send any war ship against a competent enemy unless those aboard it have been
                    trained by years of actual sea service, including incessant gunnery practice,
                    would be to invite not merely disaster, but the bitterest shame and humiliation.
                    Four thousand additional seamen and one thousand additional marines should be
                    provided; <pb n="XL" xml:id="pg_XL" facs="0040"/>and an increase in the officers
                    should be provided by making a large addition to the classes at Annapolis. There
                    is one small matter which should be mentioned in connection with Annapolis. The
                    pretentious and unmeaning title of “naval cadet” should be abolished; the title
                    of “midshipman,” full of historic association, should be restored.</p>
                <p>Even in time of peace a war ship should be used until it wears out, for only so
                    can it be kept fit to respond to any emergency. The officers and men alike
                    should be kept as much as possible on blue water, for it is there only they can
                    learn their duties as they should be learned. The big vessels should be
                    manœuvred in squadrons containing not merely battle ships, but the necessary
                    proportion of cruisers and scouts. The torpedo boats should be handled by the
                    younger officers in such manner as will best fit the latter to take
                    responsibility and meet the emergencies of actual warfare.</p>
                <p>Every detail ashore which can be performed by a civilian should be so performed,
                    the officer being kept for his special duty in the sea service. Above all,
                    gunnery practice should be unceasing. It is important to have our Navy of
                    adequate size, but it is even more important that ship for ship it should equal
                    in efficiency any navy in the world. This is possible only with highly drilled
                    crews and officers, and this in turn imperatively demands continuous and
                    progressive instruction in target practice, ship handling, squadron tactics, and
                    general discipline. Our ships must be assembled in squadrons actively cruising
                    away from harbors and never long at anchor. The resulting wear upon engines and
                    hulls must be endured; a battle ship worn out in long training of officers and
                    men is well paid for by the results, while, on the other hand, no matter in how
                    excellent condition, it is useless if the crew be not expert.</p>
                <p>We now have seventeen battle ships appropriated for, of which nine are completed
                    and have been commissioned for actual service. The remaining eight will be ready
                    in from two to four years, but it will take at least that time to recruit and
                    train the men to fight them. It is of vast concern that we have trained crews
                    ready for the vessels by the time they are commissioned. Good ships and good
                    guns are simply good weapons, and the best weapons are useless save in the hands
                    of men who know how to fight with them. The men must be trained and drilled
                    under a thorough and well-planned system of progressive instruction, while the
                    recruiting must be carried on with still greater vigor. Every effort must be
                    made to <pb n="XLI" xml:id="pg_XLI" facs="0041"/>exalt the main function of the
                    officer—the command of men. The leading graduates of the Naval Academy should be
                    assigned to the combatant branches, the line and marines.</p>
                <p>Many of the essentials of success are already recognized by the General Board,
                    which, as the central office of a growing staff, is moving steadily toward a
                    proper war efficiency and a proper efficiency of the whole Navy, under the
                    Secretary. This General Board, by fostering the creation of a general staff, is
                    providing for the official and then the general recognition of our altered
                    conditions as a Nation and of the true meaning of a great war fleet, which
                    meaning is, first, the best men, and, second, the best ships.</p>
                <p>The Naval Militia forces are State organizations, and are trained for coast
                    service, and in event of war they will constitute the inner line of defense.
                    They should receive hearty encouragement from the General Government.</p>
                <p>But in addition we should at once provide for a National Naval Reserve, organized
                    and trained under the direction of the Navy Department, and subject to the call
                    of the Chief Executive whenever war becomes imminent. It should be a real
                    auxiliary to the naval seagoing peace establishment, and offer material to be
                    drawn on at once for manning our ships in time of war. It should be composed of
                    graduates of the Naval Academy, graduates of the Naval Militia, officers and
                    crews of coast-line steamers, longshore schooners, fishing vessels, and steam
                    yachts, together with the coast population about such centers as life-saving
                    stations and light-houses.</p>
                <p>The American people must either build and maintain an adequate navy or else make
                    up their minds definitely to accept a secondary position in international
                    affairs, not merely in political, but in commercial, matters. It has been well
                    said that there is no surer way of courting national disaster than to be
                    “opulent, aggressive, and unarmed.”</p>
                <p>It is not necessary to increase our Army beyond its present size at this time.
                    But it is necessary to keep it at the highest point of efficiency. The
                    individual units who as officers and enlisted men compose this Army, are, we
                    have good reason to believe, at least as efficient as those of any other army in
                    the entire world. It is our duty to see that their training is of a kind to
                    insure the highest possible expression of power to these units when acting in
                    combination.</p>
                <p>The conditions of modern war are such as to make an infinitely heavier demand
                    than ever before upon the individual character and <pb n="XLII" xml:id="pg_XLII"
                        facs="0042"/>capacity of the officer and the enlisted man, and to make it
                    far more difficult for men to act together with effect. At present the fighting
                    must be done in extended order, which means that each man must act for himself
                    and at the same time act in combination with others with whom he is no longer in
                    the old-fashioned elbow-to-elbow touch. Under such conditions a few men of the
                    highest excellence are worth more than many men without the special skill which
                    is only found as the result of special training applied to men of exceptional
                    physique and morale. But nowadays the most valuable fighting man and the most
                    difficult to perfect is the rifleman who is also a skillful and daring
                    rider.</p>
                <p>The proportion of our cavalry regiments has wisely been increased. The American
                    cavalryman, trained to manœuvre and fight with equal facility on foot and on
                    horseback, is the best type of soldier for general purposes now to be found in
                    the world. The ideal cavalryman of the present day is a man who can fight on
                    foot as effectively as the best infantryman, and who is in addition unsurpassed
                    in the care and management of his horse and in his ability to fight on
                    horseback.</p>
                <p>A general staff should be created. As for the present staff and supply
                    departments, they should be filled by details from the line, the men so detailed
                    returning after a while to their line duties. It is very undesirable to have the
                    senior grades of the Army composed of men who have come to fill the positions by
                    the mere fact of seniority. A system should be adopted by which there shall be
                    an elimination grade by grade of those who seem unfit to render the best service
                    in the next grade. Justice to the veterans of the Civil War who are still in the
                    Army would seem to require that in the matter of retirements they be given by
                    law the same privileges accorded to their comrades in the Navy.</p>
                <p>The process of elimination of the least fit should be conducted in a manner that
                    would render it practically impossible to apply political or social pressure on
                    behalf of any candidate, so that each man may be judged purely on his own
                    merits. Pressure for the promotion of civil officials for political reasons is
                    bad enough, but it is tenfold worse where applied on behalf of officers of the
                    Army or Navy. Every promotion and every detail under the War Department must be
                    made solely with regard to the good of the service and to the capacity and merit
                    of the man himself. No pressure, political, social, or personal, of any kind,
                    will be permitted to exercise the least effect in any question of promotion or
                    detail; and if <pb n="XLIII" xml:id="pg_XLIII" facs="0043"/>there is reason to
                    believe that such pressure is exercised at the instigation of the officer
                    concerned, it will be held to militate against him. In our Army we cannot afford
                    to have rewards or duties distributed save on the simple ground that those who
                    by their own merits are entitled to the rewards get them, and that those who are
                    peculiarly fit to do the duties are chosen to perform them.</p>
                <p>Every effort should be made to bring the Army to a constantly increasing state of
                    efficiency. When on actual service no work save that directly in the line of
                    such service should be required. The paper work in the Army, as in the Navy,
                    should be greatly reduced. What is needed is proved power of command and
                    capacity to work well in the field. Constant care is necessary to prevent dry
                    rot in the transportation and commissary departments.</p>
                <p>Our Army is so small and so much scattered that it is very difficult to give the
                    higher officers (as well as the lower officers and the enlisted men) a chance to
                    practice manœuvres in mass and on a comparatively large scale. In time of need
                    no amount of individual excellence would avail against the paralysis which would
                    follow inability to work as a coherent whole, under skillful and daring
                    leadership. The Congress should provide means whereby it will be possible to
                    have field exercises by at least a division of regulars, and if possible also a
                    division of national guardsmen, once a year. These exercises might take the form
                    of field manœuvres; or, if on the Gulf Coast or the Pacific or Atlantic
                    Seaboard, or in the region of the Great Lakes, the army corps when assembled
                    could be marched from some inland point to some point on the water, there
                    embarked, disembarked after a couple of days’ journey at some other point,
                    and-again marched inland. Only by actual handling and providing for men in
                    masses while they are marching, camping, embarking, and disembarking, will it be
                    possible to train the higher officers to perform their duties well and
                    smoothly.</p>
                <p>A great debt is owing from the public to the men of the Army and Navy. They
                    should be so treated as to enable them to reach the highest point of efficiency,
                    so that they may be able to respond instantly to any demand made upon them to
                    sustain the interests of the Nation and the honor of the flag. The individual
                    American enlisted man is probably on the whole a more formidable fighting man
                    than the regular of any other army. Every consideration should be shown him, and
                    in return the highest standard of usefulness should be exacted from him. It is
                    well worth while for the Congress to consider whether the pay of enlisted men
                    upon second <pb n="XLIV" xml:id="pg_XLIV" facs="0044"/>and subsequent
                    enlistments should not be increased to correspond with the increased value of
                    the veteran soldier.</p>
                <p>Much good has already come from the act reorganizing the Army, passed early in
                    the present year. The three prime reforms, all of them of literally inestimable
                    value, are, first, the substitution of four-year details from the line for
                    permanent appointments in the so-called staff divisions; second, the
                    establishment of a corps of artillery with a chief at the head; third, the
                    establishment of a maximum and minimum limit for the Army. It would be difficult
                    to overestimate, the improvement in the efficiency of our Army which these three
                    reforms are making, and have in part already effected.</p>
                <p>The reorganization provided for by the act has been substantially accomplished.
                    The improved conditions in the Philippines have enabled the War Department
                    materially to reduce the military charge upon our revenue and to arrange the
                    number of soldiers so as to bring this number much nearer to the minimum than to
                    the maximum limit established by law. There is, however, need of supplementary
                    legislation. Thorough military education must be provided, and in addition to
                    the regulars the advantages of this education should be given to the officers of
                    the National Guard and others in civil life who desire intelligently to fit
                    themselves for possible military duty. The officers should be given the chance
                    to perfect themselves by study in the higher branches of this art. At West Point
                    the education should be of the kind most apt to turn out men who are good in
                    actual field service; too much stress should not be laid on mathematics, nor
                    should proficiency therein be held to establish the right of entry to a corps
                    d’élite. The typical American officer of the best kind need not be a good
                    mathematician; but he must be able to master himself, to control others, and to
                    show boldness and fertility of resource in every emergency.</p>
                <p>Action should be taken in reference to the militia and to the raising of
                    volunteer forces. Our militia law is obsolete and worthless. The organization
                    and armament of the National Guard of the several States, which are treated as
                    militia in the appropriations by the Congress, should be made identical with
                    those provided for the regular forces. The obligations and duties of the Guard
                    in time of war should be carefully defined, and a system established by law
                    under which the method of procedure of raising volunteer forces should be
                    prescribed in advance. It is utterly impossible in the excitement and haste of
                    impending war to do this satisfactorily if the arrangements <pb n="XLV"
                        xml:id="pg_XLV" facs="0045"/>have not been made long beforehand. Provision
                    should be made for utilizing in the first volunteer organizations called out the
                    training of those citizens who have already had experience under arms, and
                    especially for the selection in advance of the officers of any force which may
                    be raised; for careful selection of the kind necessary is impossible after the
                    outbreak of war.</p>
                <p>That the Army is not at all a mere instrument of destruction has been shown
                    during the last three years. In the Philippines, Cuba, and Porto Rico it has
                    proved itself a great constructive force, a most potent implement for the
                    upbuilding of a peaceful civilization.</p>
                <p>No other citizens deserve so well of the Republic as the veterans, the survivors
                    of those who saved the Union. They did the one deed which if left undone would
                    have meant that all else in our history went for nothing. But for their
                    steadfast prowess in the greatest crisis of our history, all our annals would be
                    meaningless, and our great experiment in popular freedom and self-government a
                    gloomy failure. Moreover, they not only left us a united Nation, but they left
                    us also as a heritage the memory of the mighty deeds by which the Nation was
                    kept united. We are now indeed one Nation, one in fact as well as in name; we
                    are united in our devotion to the flag which is the symbol of national greatness
                    and unity; and the very completeness of our union enables us all, in every part
                    of the country, to glory in the valor shown alike by the sons of the North and
                    the sons of the South in the times that tried men’s souls.</p>
                <p>The men who in the last three years have done so well in the East and the West
                    Indies and on the mainland of Asia have shown that this remembrance is not lost.
                    In any serious crisis the United States must rely for the great mass of its
                    fighting men upon the volunteer soldiery who do not make a permanent profession
                    of the military career; and whenever such a crisis arises the deathless memories
                    of the Civil War will give to Americans the lift of lofty, purpose which comes
                    to those whose fathers have stood valiantly in the forefront of the battle.</p>
                <p>The merit system of making appointments is in its essence as democratic and.
                    American as the common school system itself. It simply means that in clerical
                    and other positions where the duties are entirely non-political, all applicants
                    should have a fair field and no favor, each standing on his merits as he is able
                    to show them by practical test. Written competitive examinations offer the only
                        <pb n="XLVI" xml:id="pg_XLVI" facs="0046"/>available means in many cases for
                    applying this system. In other cases, as where laborers are employed, a system
                    of registration undoubtedly can be widely extended. There are, of course, places
                    where the written competitive examination cannot be applied, and others where it
                    offers by no means an ideal solution, but where under existing political
                    conditions it is, though an imperfect means, yet the best present means of
                    getting satisfactory results.</p>
                <p>Wherever the conditions have permitted the application of the merit system in its
                    fullest and widest sense, the gain to the Government has been immense. The
                    navy-yards and postal service illustrate, probably better than any other
                    branches of the Government, the great gain in economy, efficiency, and honesty
                    due to the enforcement of this principle.</p>
                <p>I recommend the passage of a law which will extend the classified service to the
                    District of Columbia, or will at least enable the President thus to extend it.
                    In my judgment all laws providing for the temporary employment of clerks should
                    hereafter contain a provision that they be selected under the Civil Service
                    Law.</p>
                <p>It is important to have this system obtain at home, but it is even more important
                    to have it applied rigidly in our insular possessions. Not an office should be
                    filled in the Philippines or Porto Rico with any regard to the man’s partisan
                    affiliations or services, with any regard to the political, social, or personal
                    influence which he may have at his command; in short, heed should be paid to
                    absolutely nothing save the man’s own character and capacity and the needs of
                    the service.</p>
                <p>The administration of these islands should be as wholly free from the suspicion
                    of partisan politics as the administration of the Army and Navy. All that we ask
                    from the public servant in the Philippines or Porto Rico is that he reflect
                    honor on his country by the way in which he makes that country’s rule a benefit
                    to the peoples who have come under it. This is all that we should ask, and we
                    cannot afford to be content with less.</p>
                <p>The merit system is simply one method of securing honest and efficient
                    administration of the Government; and in the long run the sole justification of
                    any type of government lies in its proving itself both honest and efficient.</p>
                <p>The consular service is now organized under the provisions of a law passed in
                    1856, which is entirely inadequate to existing conditions. The interest shown by
                    so many commercial bodies through <pb n="XLVII" xml:id="pg_XLVII" facs="0047"
                    />out the country in the reorganization of the service is heartily commended to
                    your attention. Several bills providing for a new consular service have in
                    recent years been submitted to the Congress. They are based upon the just
                    principle that appointments to the service should be made only after a practical
                    test of the applicant’s fitness, that promotions should be governed by
                    trustworthiness, adaptability, and zeal in the performance of duty, and that the
                    tenure of office should be unaffected by partisan considerations.</p>
                <p>The guardianship and fostering of our rapidly expanding foreign commerce, the
                    protection of American citizens resorting to foreign countries in lawful pursuit
                    of their affairs, and the maintenance of the dignity of the Nation abroad,
                    combine to make it essential that our consuls should be men of character,
                    knowledge, and enterprise. It is true that the service is now, in the main,
                    efficient, but a standard of excellence cannot be permanently maintained until
                    the principles set forth in the bills heretofore submitted to the Congress on
                    this subject are enacted into law.</p>
                <p>In my judgment the time has arrived when we should definitely make up our minds
                    to recognize the Indian as an individual and not as a member of a tribe. The
                    General Allotment Act is a mighty pulverizing engine to break up the tribal
                    mass. It acts directly upon the family and the individual. Under its provisions
                    some sixty thousand Indians have already become citizens of the United States.
                    We should now break up the tribal funds, doing for them what allotment does for
                    the tribal lands; that is, they should be divided into individual holdings.
                    There will be a transition period during which the funds will in many cases have
                    to be held in trust. This is the case also with the lands. A stop should be put
                    upon the indiscriminate permission to Indians to lease their allotments. The
                    effort should be steadily to make the Indian work like any other man on his own
                    ground. The marriage laws of the Indians should be made the same as those of the
                    whites.</p>
                <p>In the schools the education should be elementary and largely industrial. The
                    need of higher education among the Indians is very, very limited. On the
                    reservations care should be taken to try to suit the teaching to the needs of
                    the particular Indian. There is no use in attempting to induce agriculture in a
                    country suited only for cattle raising, where the Indian should be made a stock
                    grower. The ration system, which is merely the corral and the reservation
                    system, is highly detrimental to the Indians. It promotes beggary, <pb
                        n="XLVIII" xml:id="pg_XLVIII" facs="0048"/>perpetuates pauperism, and
                    stifles industry. It is an effectual barrier to progress. It must continue to a
                    greater or less degree as long as tribes are herded on reservations and have
                    everything in common. The Indian should be treated as an individual—like the
                    white man. During the change of treatment inevitable hardships will occur; every
                    effort should be made to minimize these hardships; but we should not because of
                    them hesitate to make the change. There should be a continuous reduction in the
                    number of agencies.</p>
                <p>In dealing with the aboriginal races few things are more important than to
                    preserve them from the terrible physical and moral degradation resulting from
                    the liquor traffic. We are doing all we can to save our own Indian tribes from
                    this evil. Wherever by international” agreement this same end can be attained as
                    regards races where we do not possess exclusive control, every effort should be
                    made to bring it about.</p>
                <p>I bespeak the most cordial support from the Congress and the people for the St.
                    Louis Exposition to Commemorate the One Hundredth Anniversary of the Louisiana
                    Purchase. This purchase was the greatest instance of expansion in our history.
                    It definitely decided that we were to become a great continental republic, by
                    far the foremost power in the Western Hemisphere. It is one of three or four
                    great landmarks in our history—the great turning points in our development. It
                    is eminently fitting that all our people should join with heartiest good will in
                    commemorating it, and the citizens of St. Louis, of Missouri, of all the
                    adjacent region, are entitled to every aid in making the celebration a
                    noteworthy event in our annals. We earnestly hope that foreign nations will
                    appreciate the deep interest our country takes in this Exposition, and our view
                    of its importance from every standpoint, and that they will participate in
                    securing its success. The National Government should be represented by a full
                    and complete set of exhibits.</p>
                <p>The people of Charleston, with great energy and civic spirit, are carrying on an
                    Exposition which will continue throughout most of the present session of the
                    Congress. I heartily commend this Exposition to the good will of the people. It
                    deserves all the encouragement that can be given it. The managers of the
                    Charleston Exposition have requested the Cabinet officers to place thereat the
                    Government exhibits which have been at Buffalo, promising to pay <pb n="XLIX"
                        xml:id="pg_XLIX" facs="0049"/>the necessary expenses. I have taken the
                    responsibility of directing that this be done, for I feel that it is due to
                    Charleston to help her in her praiseworthy effort. In my opinion the management
                    should not be required to pay all these expenses. I earnestly recommend that the
                    Congress appropriate at once the small sum necessary for this purpose.</p>
                <p>The Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo has just closed. Both from the industrial
                    and the artistic standpoint this Exposition has been in a high degree creditable
                    and useful, not merely to Buffalo but to the United States. The terrible tragedy
                    of the President’s assassination interfered materially with its being a
                    financial success. The Exposition was peculiarly in harmony with the trend of
                    our public policy, because it represented an effort to bring into closer touch
                    all the peoples of the Western Hemisphere, and give them an increasing sense of
                    unity. Such an effort was a genuine service to the entire American public.</p>
                <p>The advancement of the highest interests of national science and learning and the
                    custody of objects of art and of the valuable results of scientific expeditions
                    conducted by the United States have been committed to the Smithsonian
                    Institution. In furtherance of its declared purpose—for the “increase and
                    diffusion of knowledge among men”—the Congress has from time to time given it
                    other important functions. Such trusts have been executed by the Institution
                    with notable fidelity. There should be no halt in the work of the Institution,
                    in accordance with the plans which its Secretary has presented, for the
                    preservation of the vanishing races of great North American animals in the
                    National Zoological Park. The urgent needs of the National Museum are
                    recommended to the favorable consideration of the Congress.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most characteristic educational movement of the past fifty years is
                    that which has created the modern public library and developed it into broad and
                    active service. There are now over five thousand public libraries in the United
                    States, the product of this period. In addition to accumulating material, they
                    are also striving by organization, by improvement in method, and by cooperation,
                    to give greater efficiency to the material they hold, to make it more widely
                    useful, and by avoidance of unnecessary duplication in process to reduce the
                    cost of its administration.</p>
                <pb n="L" xml:id="pg_L" facs="0050"/>
                <p>In these efforts they naturally look for assistance to the Federal library,
                    which, though still the Library of Congress, and so entitled, is the one
                    national library of the United States. Already the largest single collection of
                    books on the Western Hemisphere, and certain to increase more rapidly than any
                    other through purchase, exchange, and the operation of the copyright law, this
                    library has a unique opportunity to render to the libraries of this country—to
                    American scholarship—service of the highest importance. It is housed in a
                    building which is the largest and most magnificent yet erected for library uses.
                    Resources are now being provided which will develop the collection properly,
                    equip it with the apparatus and service necessary to its effective use, render
                    its bibliographic work widely available, and enable it to become, not merely a
                    center of research, but the chief factor in great cooperative efforts for the
                    diffusion of knowledge and the advancement of learning.</p>
                <p>For the sake of good administration, sound economy, and the advancement of
                    science, the Census Office as now constituted should be made a permanent
                    Government bureau. This would insure better, cheaper, and more satisfactory
                    work, in the interest not only of our business but of statistic, economic, and
                    social science.</p>
                <p>The remarkable growth of the postal service is shown in the fact that its
                    revenues have doubled and its expenditures have nearly doubled within twelve
                    years. Its progressive development compels constantly increasing outlay, but in
                    this period of business energy and prosperity its receipts grow so much faster
                    than its expenses that the annual deficit has been steadily reduced from
                    $11,411,779 in 1897 to $3,923,727 in 1901. Among recent postal advances the
                    success of rural free delivery wherever established has been so marked, and
                    actual experience has made its benefits so plain, that the demand for its
                    extension is general and urgent.</p>
                <p>It is just that the great agricultural population should share in the improvement
                    of the service. The number of rural routes now in operation is 6,009,
                    practically all established within three years, and there are 6,000 applications
                    awaiting action. It is expected that the number in operation at the close of the
                    current fiscal year will reach 8,600. The mail will then be daily carried to the
                    doors of 5,700,000 of our people who have heretofore been dependent upon distant
                    offices, and one-third of all that portion of the country which is adapted to it
                    will be covered by this kind of service.</p>
                <pb n="LI" xml:id="pg_LI" facs="0051"/>
                <p>The full measure of postal progress which might be realized has long been
                    hampered and obstructed by the heavy burden imposed on the Government through
                    the intrenched and well-understood abuses which have grown up in connection with
                    second-class mail matter. The extent of this burden appears when it is stated
                    that while the second-class matter makes nearly three-fifths of the weight of
                    all the mail, it paid for the last fiscal year only $4,294,445 of the aggregate
                    postal revenue of $111,631,193. If the pound rate of postage, which produces the
                    large loss thus entailed, and which was fixed by the Congress with the purpose
                    of encouraging the dissemination of public information, were limited to the
                    legitimate newspapers and periodicals actually contemplated by the law, no just
                    exception could be taken. That expense would be the recognized arid accepted
                    cost of a liberal public policy deliberately adopted for a justifiable end. But
                    much of the matter which enjoys the privileged rate is wholly outside of the
                    intent of the law, and has secured admission only through an evasion of its
                    requirements or through lax construction. The proportion of such wrongly
                    included matter is estimated by postal experts to be one-half of the whole
                    volume of second-class mail. If it be only one-third or one-quarter, the
                    magnitude of the burden is apparent. The Post-Office Department has now
                    undertaken to remove the abuses so far as is possible by a stricter application
                    of the law; and it should be sustained in its effort.</p>
                <p>Owing to the rapid growth of our power and our interests on the Pacific, whatever
                    happens in China must be of the keenest national concern to us.</p>
                <p>The general terms of the settlement of the questions growing out of the
                    antiforeign uprisings in China of 1900, having been formulated in a joint note
                    addressed to China by the representatives of the injured powers in December
                    last, were promptly accepted by the Chinese Government. After protracted
                    conferences the plenipotentiaries of the several powers were able to sign a
                    final protocol with the Chinese plenipotentiaries on the 7th of last September,
                    setting forth the measures taken by China in compliance with the demands of the
                    joint note, and expressing their satisfaction therewith. It will be laid before
                    the Congress, with a report of the plenipotentiary on behalf of the United
                    States, Mr. William Woodville Rockhill, to whom high praise is due for the tact,
                    good judgment, and energy he has displayed in performing an exceptionally
                    difficult and delicate task.</p>
                <pb n="LII" xml:id="pg_LII" facs="0052"/>
                <p>The agreement reached disposes in a manner satisfactory to the powers of the
                    various grounds of complaint, and will contribute materially to better future
                    relations between China and the powers. Reparation has been made by China for
                    the murder of foreigners during the uprising and punishment has been inflicted
                    on the officials, however high in rank, recognized as responsible for or having
                    participated in the outbreak. Official examinations have been forbidden for a
                    period of five years in all cities in which foreigners have been murdered or
                    cruelly treated, and edicts have been issued making all officials directly
                    responsible for the future safety of foreigners and for the suppression of
                    violence against them.</p>
                <p>Provisions have been made for insuring the future safety of the foreign
                    representatives in Peking by setting aside for their exclusive use a quarter of
                    the city which the powers can make defensible and in which they can if necessary
                    maintain permanent military guards; by dismantling the military works between
                    the capital and the sea; and by allowing the temporary maintenance of foreign
                    military posts along this line. An edict has been issued by the Emperor of China
                    prohibiting for two years the importation of arms and ammunition into China.
                    China has agreed to pay adequate indemnities to the states, societies, and
                    individuals for the losses sustained by them and for the expenses of the
                    military expeditions sent by the various powers to protect life and restore
                    order.</p>
                <p>Under the provisions of the joint note of December, 1900, China has agreed to
                    revise the treaties of commerce and navigation and to take such other steps for
                    the purpose of facilitating foreign trade as the foreign powers may decide to be
                    needed.</p>
                <p>The Chinese Government has agreed to participate financially in the work of
                    bettering the water approaches to Shanghai and to Tientsin, the centers of
                    foreign trade in central and northern China, and an international conservancy
                    board, in which the Chinese Government is largely represented, has been provided
                    for the improvement of the Shanghai River and the control of its navigation. In
                    the same line of commercial advantages a revision of the present tariff on
                    imports has been assented to for the purpose of substituting specific for <hi
                        rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> duties, and an expert has been sent abroad on
                    the part of the United States to assist in this work. A list of articles to
                    remain free of duty, including flour, cereals, and rice, gold and silver coin
                    and bullion, has also been agreed upon in the settlement.</p>
                <p>During these troubles our Government has unswervingly advocated moderation, and
                    has materially aided in bringing about an <pb n="LIII" xml:id="pg_LIII"
                        facs="0053"/>adjustment which tends to enhance the welfare of China and to
                    lead to a more beneficial intercourse between the Empire and the modern world;
                    while in the critical period of revolt and massacre we did our full share in
                    safeguarding life and property, restoring order, and vindicating the national
                    interest and honor. It behooves us to continue in these paths, doing what lies
                    in our power to foster feelings of good will, and leaving no effort untried to
                    work out the great policy of full and fair intercourse between China and the
                    nations, on a footing of equal rights and advantages to all. We advocate the
                    “open door” with all that it implies; not merely the procurement of enlarged
                    commercial opportunities on the coasts, but access to the interior by the
                    waterways with which China has been so extraordinarily favored. Only by bringing
                    the people of China into peaceful and friendly community of trade with all the
                    peoples of the earth can the work now auspiciously begun be carried to fruition.
                    In the attainment of this purpose we necessarily claim parity of treatment,
                    under the conventions, throughout the Empire for our trade and our citizens with
                    those of all other powers.</p>
                <p>We view with lively interest and keen hopes of beneficial results the proceedings
                    of the Pan-American Congress, convoked at the invitation of Mexico, and now
                    sitting at the Mexican capital. The delegates of the United States are under the
                    most liberal instructions to cooperate with their colleagues in all matters
                    promising advantage to the great family of American commonwealths, as well in
                    their relations among themselves as in their domestic advancement and in their
                    intercourse with the world at large.</p>
                <p>My predecessor communicated to the Congress the fact that the Weil and La Abra
                    awards against Mexico have been adjudged by the highest courts of our country to
                    have been obtained through fraud and perjury on the part of the claimants, and
                    that in accordance with the acts of the Congress the money remaining in the
                    hands of the Secretary of State on these awards has been returned to Mexico. A
                    considerable portion of the money received from Mexico on these awards had been
                    paid by this Government to the claimants before the decision of the courts was
                    rendered. My judgment is that the Congress should return to Mexico an amount
                    equal to the sums thus already paid to the claimants.</p>
                <p>The death of Queen Victoria caused the people of the United States deep and
                    heartfelt sorrow, to which the Government gave full expression. When President
                    McKinley died, our Nation in turn <pb n="LIV" xml:id="pg_LIV" facs="0054"
                    />received from every quarter of the British Empire expressions of grief and
                    sympathy no less sincere. The death of the Empress Dowager Frederick of Germany
                    also aroused the genuine sympathy of the American people; and this sympathy was
                    cordially reciprocated by Germany when the President was assassinated. Indeed,
                    from every quarter of the civilized world we received, at the time of the
                    President’s death, assurances of such grief and regard as to touch the hearts of
                    our people. In the midst of our affliction we reverently thank the Almighty that
                    we are at peace with the nations of mankind; and we firmly intend that our
                    policy shall be such as to continue unbroken these international relations of
                    mutual respect and good will.</p>

                            erroneous in point of fact. It is for the aggrieved party to produce

                            embassy should not be burdened with such cases, it is entirely proper

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that I
                            rejected the application of one Mr. Frank H. Bowers for a passport on
                            the following facts which are respectfully submitted for your approval
                            or revision as the case may require:</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bowers was born of American parents in the city of Buenos Ayres,
                            Argentine Republic, on the 17th day of February, 1880, in which city he
                            has since resided, with the exception of some two years while absent at
                            school. Being nearly 21 years of age he now proposes to go to the United
                            States with the intention of making his permanent residence in the city
                            of Boston, Mass., where he intends to engage in business—probably as the
                            other end of the business here—and where his mother now resides, having
                            recently removed from this city to that place. As Mr. Bowers desired to
                            spend a few weeks traveling in Europe before proceeding to his
                            destination in the United States, he made application to this legation
                            for a passport as an American citizen under the provision of section
                            1993, Revised Statutes of the United States; but, in view of the
                            provision of section 1 of Article I of the Argentine law, No. 346, of
                            October 8, 1869, declaring all persons born within the territory of the
                            Argentine Republic, though of foreign parentage, to be Argentine
                            citizens, I did not feel warranted in granting his application for a
                            passport.</p>
                        <p>I deem it proper to say, upon the facts as stated, that I was first
                            inclined to grant Mr. Bowers’s application for a passport, intending to
                            inform him that it furnished him no security against any claim that the
                            Argentine Government might assert to his allegiance or service while he
                            remained within the Argentine jurisdiction; but a subsequent reading of
                            the opinion of Mr. Attorney-General Hoar to Mr. Secretary of State Fish,
                            dated the 12th of June, 1869, led me to the conclusion that persons born
                            of American parents in the Argentine Republic, which declares them to be
                            citizens thereof, could not avail themselves of the provisions of
                            section 1993 to obtain a certificate of their American citizenship while
                            they continue within the Argentine territory, nor, possibly, until they
                            should come within the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the United
                            States.</p>

                            No. 89, of the 12th ultimo, reporting that you had rejected the
                            application of Mr. Frank H. Bowers for a passport.</p>
                        <p>It appears that Mr. Bowers was born of American parents in Buenos Ayres
                            on February 17, 1880, in which city he has since resided with an
                            exception of two years’ absence at school. He desired the passport to
                            use in Europe while en route to the United States, where he expects to
                            reside.</p>
                        <p>In reply I have to say that the Department is of opinion that you should
                            have issued the passport, as Mr. Bowers was clearly an American citizen,
                            under section 1993, Revised Statutes, being born abroad of American
                            parents.</p>
                        <p>You need not have concerned yourself with the conflict between the United
                            States and Argentine laws, as it does not appear that the Argentine
                            Government had made any claim to Mr. Bowers’s allegiance, and he was,
                            moreover, about to leave the Republic finally, and to come to the United
                            States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my cablegram of the 5th
                            instant, relative to the state of siege in this capital, I beg to say
                            that the street disturbances or public disorders which caused the
                            executive power, with the sanction of Congress, to issue a decree
                            declaring this capital to be in a state of siege for six months, grew
                            out of opposition to a bill for unifying the public debt.</p>
                        <p>During the present year there has been considerable discussion in the
                            press as to the advisability of consolidating the public debt, which
                            consists of some thirty loans bearing different rates of interest, into
                            one loan with a uniform interest. In the progress of this discussion, it
                            was not apparent that there was any serious objection to the adoption
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0083"/>of a financial measure which
                            should accomplish this object without increasing the public debt or
                            pledging the customs revenue for its payment. While it was not
                            positively known that a proposition was on foot looking to the
                            unification of these loans having the approval of the Government, it was
                            surmised—and it was intimated— that Dr. Cárlos Pellegrini, a leading
                            senator, and Mr. Ernesto Tornquist, a prominent financier of this city,
                            who were then in Europe, had been authorized by the Government to treat
                            with its creditors and ascertain the terms on which a unification of the
                            public debt could be effected. This supposition led to much talk and
                            discussion concerning the terms and conditions which should form the
                            basis of a measure of this character and also to some apprehension,
                            quite freely expressed, that the opportunity afforded in dealing with
                            such measure would be used for speculation to the detriment of the
                            Government’s credit and interests.</p>
                        <p>When Congress opened its session in May last, there was a good deal of
                            curiosity exhibited to know what the President would say in his message
                            about consolidating the public debt and a good deal of surprise
                            expressed that he should have made no mention nor reference to that
                            subject. But, as Dr. Pellegrini had not returned from Europe to resume
                            his seat in the senate, it was surmised that he was delayed on account
                            of not having been able to arrange satisfactory terms, and to this fact
                            the public attributed the President’s reticence to unification in his
                            message. So the discussion went on growing more intense, but not
                            heated.</p>
                        <p>About a month after the opening of Congress, Dr. Pellegrini returned to
                            Buenos Ayres, resumed his seat in the Senate, and took part in its
                            discussions, giving no intimation of nor making any reference to the
                            subject of unification. As the finances were known to be in desperate
                            straits and some remedy for their improvement considered to be of
                            paramount importance, the belief still prevailed that some sort of
                            scheme for the unification of the public debt would be proposed,
                            notwithstanding the silence of Dr. Pelligrini and the reticence of
                            Government officials. The consequence was that the press became more
                            vigorous in its comments and criticisms on the action of the Government
                            and the people more expectant and agitated.</p>
                        <p>At last the President sent a message to Congress recommending a bill for
                            consolidating the public debt, the chief features of which bill were to
                            be as stated: (1) The decrease of the service of the debt by $5,000,000;
                            (2) the consolidation of the thirty existing loans into one, with a
                            uniform rate of interest and an amortization, and (3) the payment of the
                            balance of the ‘floating debt, maturing in this year and next, amounting
                            to $18,000,000 gold. The public debt is about $385,000,000 and the
                            unification bill included it and some other items, making the whole sum
                            of $435,000,000. The bill provided that 70 per cent of the customs
                            receipts should be turned over daily, not into the national treasury,
                            but a certain bank designated by the creditors, to be applied to the
                            obligations incurred. It will be seen, therefore, that the scheme for
                            consolidating the public debt increased its amount and pledged a portion
                            of the only gold revenue of the nation to meet its obligations. The bill
                            was presented by Dr. Pelligrini in the Senate with a short speech in
                            support of it. Without further discussion it passed the Senate with only
                            two dissentient votes, and was sent to the House of Deputies, where it
                            was referred to a committee, who reported favorably upon it.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0084"/>
                        <p>The bill was bitterly opposed by the press, and the hostility of the
                            people began to manifest itself. The object of the bill was to improve
                            the public credit. It was declared that no logic could demonstrate that
                            an increase of the public debt combined with the mortgage of the public
                            revenues could be a betterment of the public credit, nor, on the other
                            hand, that the recovery of a lost credit could be achieved by mortgaging
                            its revenues. * * *</p>
                        <p>The public mind was greatly agitated, and a spirit of discontentment
                            began to manifest itself among the people. Some meetings were called for
                            purposes of protest. The university students, numbering over 1,000,
                            marched to Congress and presented a petition and protest, which was
                            evidently written by some older head, and on their return were joined by
                            a great crowd of the discontented, crying out “Down with the President,”
                            “Down with the unification bill,” etc. This was the initiation of the
                            disturbances. The President’s house was attacked, and it was rumored
                            that he and his family took refuge in the Royal Hotel. The mob attacked
                            Dr. Pellegrini, whom they met in the street, but he was rescued by
                            friends, and then passed down Florida street, until they reached the
                            office of El País, when they proceeded to smash its windows, not,
                            however, without meeting with some resistance from the inmates of the
                            building. Turbulence and disorder began now to spread and affect the
                            peace and business of the city. The office of the Tribuna was also
                            attacked, but without much damage. In the meantime the police were
                            reenforced, and their efforts to disperse the crowd and restore order
                            partially succeeded. The next day, however, a large and menacing crowd
                            gathered on the plaza in front of the Government building, and, not
                            dispersing at the command of the police, a charge was ordered of mounted
                            police to clear the plaza and streets adjoining, and a collision took
                            place in which shots were freely exchanged, wounding several and killing
                            a few. The mob finally began to give way and, being hard pressed, to
                            break into several bodies, and the police, being at the same time
                            reenforced by firemen with Mauser rifles, succeeded in dispersing them
                            and in partially restoring order, though the spirit, of rebellion and
                            resistance against the constituted authorities was not entirely
                            subdued.</p>
                        <p>At this crisis the President asked and Congress granted him authority to
                            declare the city in a state of siege. Troops from the provinces were
                            quietly brought into the city, quartered in barracks, and reviewed,
                            ostensibly as a preparation for the usual ninth of July parade
                            (independence day), but actually to preserve public order in the event
                            their services should be needed. Sunday morning (July 7) opened on a
                            comparatively quiet day. There were no large gatherings of crowds nor
                            acts of turbulence.</p>
                        <p>The President is an able and conciliatory man. He had been popular with
                            the people, who had shown him frequent manifestations of their favor and
                            good will. He undoubtedly felt that popular sentiment against the
                            unification bill must be appeased. On the 8th instant he sent a message
                            to the Chamber of Deputies withdrawing the unification bill, which was
                            awaiting its consideration. The Chamber immediately passed a resolution
                            adjourning sine die the further consideration of the bill. This action
                            is supposed to signify an entire change of the financial policy of the
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Still, there were those who thought that a hostile demonstration would be
                            liable to occur on independence day, and great precautions <pb n="5"
                                xml:id="pg_5" facs="0085"/>were taken to forestall it and preserve
                            the public peace. The President gave his customary banquet to the
                            diplomatic corps and prominent officials of his Government on Monday
                            evening, and on Tuesday (independence day) the same officials attended
                            the Te Deum at the cathedral by his invitation and witnessed the review
                            of troops from the balconies of the Government building. Everything
                            passed off quietly, peaceably, and in the usual manner, except that the
                            crowd of citizens was smaller as compared with former occasions and few
                            cheers greeted the President.</p>
                        <p>As a consequence of the withdrawal of the unification bill, the minister
                            of finance, Señor Enrique Berduc, tendered his resignation which was
                            accepted by the President. The minister of agriculture, Señor Ezequiel
                            Ramos Mexía, also resigned in consequence, it is said, of party ties
                            connecting him with Dr. Pellegrini. The ministers of war and marine also
                            tendered their resignations in order to give the President an
                            opportunity to reorganize his cabinet, but they were requested to retain
                            their respective posts.</p>
                        <p>The act of withdrawing the bill seems to have given satisfaction to
                            public opinion. The state of siege still exists, but all evidences of
                            turbulence and discontent have disappeared. The city wears its wonted
                            aspect of peace, businesses pursuing its accustomed channels, and public
                            order and quiet prevail.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the unification bill, I have never doubted but that the
                            President was animated by an honest purpose and laudable zeal to better
                            the condition of finances and maintain the public credit in his support
                            of that measure, conceding that the bill itself was liable to serious
                            objection. To sum up, it appears that the recent street disturbances and
                            acts of violence in this city were caused by the press inveighing
                            against the unification bill, and producing in the public mind the
                            belief that it boded evil to the good name and financial credit of the
                            nation, and that the action of the President in withdrawing such
                            unification bill had the effect to allay popular passion * * *</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since the withdrawal of the unification
                            bill, referred to in my No. 128, of the 11th instant, there have been no
                            street tumults disturbing the public peace or menacing official
                            authority. Public order and quiet prevail throughout the city. The press
                            generally approves the action of the President in withdrawing the bill,
                            as well as some recent public utterances in which he declares it to be
                            his intention to give due consideration to public opinion in matters of
                            public concern. In view of <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0086"/>this

                            the death of William McKinley, President of the United States, in the
                            city of Buffalo, at fifteen minutes past 2 in the morning of to-day,

                            filled, but by the people of all friendly nations, whose messages of
                            sympathy and of hope while hope was possible have been most consolatory
                            in this time of sore trial.</p>
                        <p>Now that the end has come, I request you, sir, to be the medium of

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department is frequently in receipt of
                            information that naturalized citizens who receive passports suppose
                            themselves to be thereby rendered exempt from the operation of the
                            military laws and laws relating to expatriation of the country of their
                            origin upon their return, and occasionally they complain that they were
                            not informed by the Department when they received the passport of the
                            limits of the protection it would afford. Of course, whenever
                            information has been asked, the Department has given such as it
                            possessed, but it has not heretofore furnished this information in
                            advance of a request for it. It has been determined to inaugurate a new
                            system by which no American citizen of foreign birth shall receive
                            passports without being informed of those general provisions of law of
                            the land of his birth which it is important for him to know before he
                            returns to it. He will therefore receive with his passport a brief and
                            easily comprehended statement applicable to his case. Inclosed is the
                                draft<note n="b" xml:id="d10fnb">Not printed.</note> of the notice

                            military service between the ages of nineteen and forty-two years.</p>
                        <p>Under the terms of the treaty between the United States and
                            Austria-Hungary a former subject of that country now a naturalized
                            citizen of the United States is treated upon his return as a citizen of
                            the United States. If he violated any of the criminal laws of
                            Austria-Hungary before the date of emigration he remains liable to trial
                            and punishment, unless the right to punish has been lost by lapse of
                            time as provided by law. A naturalized American citizen formerly a
                            subject of Austria-Hungary may be arrested and punished under the
                            military laws only in the following cases: (1) If he was accepted and
                            enrolled as a recruit in the army before the date of emigration,
                            although he had not been put in service; (2) if he was a soldier when he
                            emigrated, either in active service or on leave of absence; (3) if he
                            was summoned by notice or by proclamation before his emigration to serve
                            in the reserve or militia, and failed to obey the call; (4) if he
                            emigrated after war had broken out.</p>
                        <p>A naturalized American citizen of Austro-Hungarian origin on arriving in
                            that country should at once show his passport to the proper authorities;
                            and if, on inquiry, it is found that his name is on the military rolls,
                            he should request it to be struck off, calling attention to the treaty
                            of September 20, 1870, between this country and Austria-Hungary.</p>
                        <p>The laws of Austria-Hungary require every stranger to produce a passport
                            on entering. This provision is not usually enforced, but may be at any
                            time. Travelers are usually called upon to establish their identity and
                            are advised to provide themselves with passports. They do not ordinarily
                            require to be visaed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 18th day of January, 1901, the
                            consul at Reichenberg informed me that John Richter, an Austrian-born
                            naturalized citizen of the United States, bearing a passport, had been
                            expelled from his native country, where he was sojourning.</p>
                        <p>I sent the consul a copy of the treaty of 1870, with directions to send
                            it to the bezirkshauptmann at Schluckenau, and to invite his attention
                            to the fact that Richter was not subject to arrest or expulsion. I also
                            addressed a note to the foreign office, a copy whereof is inclosed.</p>
                        <p>In a few days I had a letter from the consul stating that the
                            bezirkshauptmann had notified Richter that he might return. A letter
                            lately received from the consul is to the effect that Richter had made
                            no further complaint, and it is thought he has returned to America.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime a carefully prepared note came down from the foreign
                            office, a translation whereof is inclosed.</p>
                        <p>I would not report the case except for the fact that it will be noticed
                            the authorities for the first time put a new interpretation on the
                            treaty <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0089"/>of 1870, to the effect that
                            there is no fixed time during which an American may sojourn in
                            Austria-Hungary, and therefore His Majesty’s Government may expel any
                            American at pleasure.</p>
                        <p>I do not entertain this view; but I have felt that it was better to lay
                            the matter before you for instructions. If you do not consent to this
                            construction of the treaty, I recommend that a clear and firm protest be
                            made to the foreign office, so that the case may not be taken as a
                            precedent.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: I regret that I am
                                compelled to invite the attention of your excellency to the
                                following case, reported to this legation from the United States
                                consul at Reichenberg. He reports:</p>
                            <p>That John Richter was born in Bohemia in 1873. That at the age of 14½
                                years he was taken by his mother as an emigrant to the United
                                States, where he resided continuously until about the month of
                                October, 1900, when he returned to Schluckenau, the place of his
                                nativity. He was naturalized as a citizen of the United States on
                                October 12, 1896, in the circuit court of Cook County, State of
                                Illinois (Chicago). He holds a passport issued to him by Col. John
                                Hay, Secretary of State of the United States, dated September 26,
                                1900.</p>
                            <p>The consul reports that the bezirkshauptmann at Schluckenau refused
                                to recognize the treaty rights of Mr. Richter, although shown the
                                said passport, and ordered him to leave the bezirk within eight days
                                or he would be expelled by force. Thereupon the consul addressed a
                                letter to the bezirkshauptmann caking attention to the fact that Mr.
                                Richter was a citizen of the United States and had a right to
                                sojourn in this country, and also instructed Mr. Richter to explain
                                to the bezirkshauptmann the fact that he was lawfully at
                                Schluckenau, which he did. Whereupon the bezirkshauptmann declared
                                “the American representatives in this country could do nothing in
                                the case,” and required a gendarme to drive him out of the bezirk,
                                and said to Mr. Richter that he would be arrested if he returned.
                                Mr. Richter, to avoid further trouble, under protest obeyed the
                                commands of the bezirkshauptmann and is temporarily elsewhere.</p>
                            <p>I respectfully ask that your excellency will cause the facts to be
                                inquired into, and if found substantially as herein stated, to
                                direct the bezirkshauptmann to revoke his order of expulsion, and to
                                inform Mr. Richter, through the consul or otherwise, that his
                                conduct was in violation of the treaty of 1870, and that he has the
                                right to return to and sojourn in Schluckenau, and to be treated as
                                a citizen of the United States.</p>

                            <p>The imperial and royal ministry for foreign affairs did not fail to
                                communicate, in due course of time, the contents of the esteemed
                                note of the 23d of January of this year, concerning the matter of
                                the expulsion of the naturalized American citizen John Richter, to
                                the imperial and royal ministry of the interior, in order that the
                                case might be treated accordingly.</p>
                            <p>The ministry of the interior at once caused the necessary
                                investigations to be made with reference thereto, which, when
                                examined, result in the following:</p>
                            <p>John Richter, who, while still an Austrian subject, emigrated in the
                                year 1887 without authorization (according to the provision of
                                paragraph 54 of the law of October 2, 1882, Imperial and Royal Law
                                Bulletin No. 153, then in force), thereby made himself guilty of a
                                transgression (according to paragraph 35 of the military law <pb
                                    n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0090"/>of the 11th of April, 1889,
                                Imperial and Royal Law Bulletin No. 41, and to paragraph 23 of the
                                Military Regulations, first part, respectively), by his failure to
                                report for conscription, and of the crime, eventually transgression,
                                of desertion (according to paragraphs 44 and 45 of the law referred
                                to, and to paragraph 80 of the Military Regulations, first part,
                                respectively). Therefore, if Richter had remained an Austrian
                                subject, he would have to be called to account for the said
                                punishable actions, and, moreover (according to paragraph 38, last
                                item, of the military law), would have to be held to perform his
                                neglected liability of presenting himself for military examination,
                                with the eventual consequences of removal from the age class and
                                conscription number and increased service in the sense of paragraph
                                44 of the military law.</p>
                            <p>But in view of the fact that Richter is—according to article I of the
                                treaty concluded with the United States of America on the 20th of
                                September, 1870 (Imperial and Royal Law Bulletin No. 74, ex 1871)—to
                                be treated as an American citizen, he can not be held liable to
                                trial and punishment under Article II of that treaty, for the
                                nonfulfillment of his military duty, nor be held subsequently to
                                perform this duty.</p>
                            <p>The provisions of this treaty were in no way violated by the imperial
                                and royal Bezirkshauptmannschaft at Schluckenau.</p>
                            <p>It is true that the imperial and royal Bezirkshauptmannschaft did
                                order John Richter to leave the district within eight days; but this
                                procedure can not be regarded as in contradiction to the treaty
                                referred to, as the latter contains no provision with reference to
                                the right of stay in Austria of American citizens, and in particular
                                does not grant them the right of indefinite stay. This right of stay
                                is therefore subjected to all those limitations which have been
                                established by the general binding laws of this country, and by
                                those which public considerations may require; to this applies in
                                particular item 5 of paragraph 2 of the law of the 27th of July,
                                1871, Imperial and Royal Law Bulletin No. 88, according to which
                                persons who are not Austrian subjects may be expelled either from
                                the entire territory in which that law has jurisdiction, or from a
                                certain part of it, if their stay in it becomes inadmissible for
                                reasons of public order or safety.</p>
                            <p>According to the investigations made, the ostentatious manner in
                                which Richter evaded his legal duty to do military service is
                                causing public scandal, and may very easily give others an impetus
                                to similar demoralizing acts. This apprehension is strengthened by
                                the fact that more than thirty persons from the district of
                                Schlukenau, who are liable to military presentation, are in
                                America.</p>
                            <p>In consideration of this fact the procedure of the imperial and royal
                                Bezirkshauptmannschaft in Schluckenau appears to be legally based,
                                and in view of the protection required by public interests also
                                appears to be fully justified; and the imperial and royal ministry
                                of the interior is therefore, to its regret, not in a position to
                                issue any order in behalf of John Richter.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of
                            dispatch No. 188, of April 26, 1901, reporting the expulsion case of
                            John Richter, a nat uralized American citizen of Austrian birth.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Harris states that the Austro-Hungarian authorities claim that under
                            the naturalization treaty between the two countries there is no fixed
                            time during which a naturalized American of Austrian origin may sojourn
                            in that country, and that they may “expel him at pleasure.” Mr. Harris
                            dissents from this view, but refers the matter to the Department.</p>
                        <p>The treaty contemplates that persons of Austrian origin naturalized in
                            the United States may resort to their native country. It does not,
                            however, fix the period of their sojourn there.</p>
                        <p>Whether such persons may be expelled from Austria, and when, would seem
                            to depend upon the particular circumstances of each case. <pb n="11"
                                xml:id="pg_11" facs="0091"/>Undoubtedly the Austro-Hungarian
                            Government has the right to expel from its territory persons injurious
                            to peace and good order, but it is the reasonable contention of the
                            United States Government that the pernicious character of the returning
                            person should be affirmatively shown in justification of the extreme
                            resort to expulsion, and that the right so claimed should not rest on a
                            vague and general theory of inconvenient example which might be
                            stretched to cover the cases of all Austro-Hungarians naturalized here
                            and returning to their original jurisdiction. The treaty undoubtedly
                            gives the right of inoffensive return, and that stipulation is not to be
                            impaired by any construction which would virtually annul the treaty in
                            an important particular. The Austrian law provides for the expulsion of
                            aliens whose presence is inadmissible for reasons of public order and
                            safety. The reason given by the Austrian foreign office for considering
                            Richter’s stay there undesirable is that “the ostentatious manner in
                            which he evaded his legal duty to do military service is causing public
                            scandal, and may very easily give others an impetus to similar
                            demoralizing acts.”</p>
                        <p>As Richter was only 14 years of age when his mother took him to the
                            United States, and would not have been subject to military service until
                            he reached the age of 19, it might be questioned whether he left for the
                            purpose of evading military duty. However, as Mr. Harris states that
                            Richter was informed by the Austrian authorities that he might return to
                            the place from which he was expelled and has made no further complaint,
                            it would not seem desirable to take up this case with the Austrian
                            Government.</p>

                            Department for instructions the following case:</p>
                        <p>On the 2d instant, Consul Donzelmann, at Prague, sent to this legation
                            the application for passport of one Carl Schimaneck, with the following
                            report: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>I have the honor to transmit to you, herewith inclosed, a
                                    passport application by one Carl Schimaneck, together with an
                                    old passport, a declaration of intention made by one Anton
                                    Schimaneck, who is claimed as having been the father of this
                                    applicant, a certificate of marriage establishing the fact of
                                    the applicant’s parents having been married in the United
                                    States, and a certificate of birth of this applicant. The facts
                                    in the case of this applicant, as he has stated in this
                                    consulate this day, are these, viz:</p>
                                <p>His father emigrated to the United States in 1876, and shortly
                                    after his arrival there declared his intention to become an
                                    American citizen, as evidenced by the certificate herewith
                                    inclosed. The father died before completing his American
                                    citizenship, and having married between the time of declaring
                                    his intention to become an American citizen and his death, as
                                    the issue of this marriage was this applicant who was born in
                                    the United States. The mother of this applicant returned to her
                                    and her deceased husband’s native country, which was Bohemia,
                                    belonging to the <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0092"/>Emperor
                                    of Austria as the sovereign, taking with her this applicant, her
                                    child. The mother never perfected her American citizenship, as
                                    provided by law, and has remained ever since her return to
                                    Bohemia, which was in the year 1881, an Austrian subject, and
                                    the child so brought over here never left Bohemia, never knew a
                                    word of the American language, and has married here in Bohemia
                                    another subject of Austria, thus evincing every desire to
                                    forever remain here in Austria. The facts, then, are that the
                                    applicant was born of foreign parents while they were sojourning
                                    in the United States of America, and under the facts stated
                                    heretofore this applicant did not become an American citizen
                                    simply because he happened to be born in the United States.
                                    Indeed, the declaration of intention made by the applicant’s
                                    deceased father is not valid in law, as it states that he
                                    declared himself to have been a subject of the Emperor of
                                    Germany, when in fact he never had been any other than a subject
                                    of the Emperor of Austria. But admitting for the sake of
                                    argument that this certificate is in conformity with the law
                                    governing the same, yet the applicant is not an American citizen
                                    because his mother, as well as himself, never complied with the
                                    law of the United States governing such cases. I do not think
                                    that our Government ought to be charged with the protection of
                                    this applicant, the law not permitting it.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>As section 1992, Revised Statutes of the United States, expressly
                            declares that “All persons born in the United States and not subject to
                            any foreign power * * * are declared to be citizens of the United
                            States,” Mr. Carl Schimaneck would appear to be a native citizen of the
                            United States. It is true that he left the United States when but 4
                            years of age and has resided in Bohemia, the native country of his
                            parents, ever since. It is also true that he has married an Austrian
                            subject, and he does not appear to have any interests in the United
                            States. And while he declares it to be his intention to return to the
                            United States within two years, Consul Donzelmann says Mr. Schimaneck’s
                            real purpose in applying for a new passport is to enable him to obtain a
                            license from the Bohemian authorities to engage in business in Bohemia.
                            In the application for passport made before this legation on the 2d of
                            August, 1894, Mr. Schimaneck also declared his intention to return to
                            the United States within two years. This intention he did not carry out.
                            But he has not applied for a passport since and it does not appear that
                            his case is one where trouble is to be feared from the military
                            authorities. He appears to desire the new passport solely for the
                            purpose of obtaining a new concession to enter into business, and I have
                            therefore the honor to lay the case before the Department with the
                            respectful request that full instructions may be sent to me in the
                            matter. Copies of the documents in the case as transmitted to me by
                            Consul Donzelmann are respectfully inclosed herewith.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department has received your No. 10 of
                            July 10, 1901, submitting the application for a passport of Carl
                            Schimaneck, and a presentation of his case by Consul Donzelman at
                            Prague, who thinks the applicant is not entitled to protection as a
                            citizen of the United States. It appears that he was born here; that his
                            father had declared his intention of becoming a citizen of the United
                            States before the son’s birth, but died before he secured
                            naturalization; that the mother never secured naturalization as a
                            citizen of the United States, and returned to Bohemia with the applicant
                            when he was four years of age, and that he has himself never been in the
                            United States since. He does not speak English, has married a Bohemian,
                            is engaged in local business, and, as it would seem, is permanently
                            settled in Bohemia. In considering the case, the question of the
                            citizenship of the applicant’s parents is not material, as Consul
                            Donzelman seems to think it is, because birth in the United States of
                            itself confers United States citizenship under the provisions of our
                            laws. In construing these provisions the legation has correctly followed
                            the numerous rulings on the subject by this Department (see The American
                            Passport, pp. 102, 104, 105), and the rulings are themselves in full
                            consonance with the decisons of the Federal courts. (See notably 35 Fed.
                            Rep., 354, and 169 U. S., 649.) If, therefore, the applicant were still
                            in his minority, or were only temporarily abroad, there would be no
                            doubt of his being entitled to the protection of a passport as a native
                            citizen of the United States. The question really involved, however, is
                            whether or not he has abandoned his right to that protection. The
                            Department’s circular instruction of March 27, 1899, on the subject of
                            “Passports for persons residing or sojourning abroad,” contained the
                            following quotation from Secretary Fish: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>When a person <hi rend="italic">who has attained his

                                    there, he is stamped with the national character of his new
                                    domicile; and <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0094"/>this is so,
                                    notwithstanding he may entertain a floating intention of
                                    returning to his original residence or citizenship at some
                                    future period, and the presumption of law with respect to
                                    residence in a foreign country, especially if it be protracted,
                                    is that the party is there <hi rend="italic">animo manendi</hi>,
                                    and it lies with him to explain it.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Obviously, these remarks apply with equal force to one who remains in a
                            foreign country after he has attained his majority. The circular further
                            says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>When an applicant has completely severed his relations with the

                                    married and established a home in a foreign land; has engaged in
                                    business or professional pursuits wholly in foreign countries;
                                    has so shaped his plans as to make it impossible or improbable
                                    that they will ever include a domicile in this country—these and
                                    similar circumstances should exercise an adverse influence in
                                    determining the question whether or not a passport should
                                    issue.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Each circumstance quoted above appears to be applicable to Mr.
                            Schimaneck, with the additional fact that in applying for the passport
                            issued him by your legation August 4, 1894, he swore that he intended to
                            return to the United States, which he has not done, and in his pending
                            application he makes the same promise, which there is strong reason for
                            believing he will not keep. The circular also says: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>If, in making application for a passport, he (the applicant)
                                    swears that he intends to return to the United States within a
                                    given period, and afterwards, in applying for a renewal of his
                                    passport, it appears that he did not fulfill his intention, this
                                    circumstance awakens a doubt as to his real purpose which he
                                    must dispel.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>So far from the doubt having been dispelled in this case, it appears to
                            have been confirmed. The Department is therefore of the opinion that,
                            there being no additional facts to change the aspect of the case, Mr.
                            Schimaneck’s application for a passport should not be granted and the
                            applicant informed that he must renew his residence in the United States
                            which was abandoned in his infancy, before he can expect to receive the
                            protection of this Government while he is abroad.</p>

                            information that naturalized citizens who receive its passports suppose
                            themselves to be thereby rendered exempt from the operation of the
                            military laws and laws relating to expatriation of the country of their
                            origin on their return. It has, therefore, been determined to send to
                            each person of foreign birth who receives a passport from this
                            Department a brief and easily comprehended statement, showing what

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: I am over in Europe making
                                historical researches for a new work on American history, and had a
                                nervous attack from overwork, whereon the doctor ordered me to go to
                                Middelkerke, a quiet seaside place, to spend a month. The inclosed
                                    <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0098"/>extract from an English
                                and French newspaper will tell you what happened to me, and as my
                                father was a South Carolina man, I think I ought to let you know. I
                                sent a claim for damages to the Hon. Lawrence Townsend, United
                                States minister plenipotentiary at Brussels. He was out of town when
                                I called, but the secretary told me that the Belgian Government
                                decline all responsibility for the acts of their village chiefs. The
                                vice-consul at Ghent said that they would give nothing for slapping
                                me in the face after taking me falsely into custody, and that the
                                consular rules order all consuls to keep on as good terms as
                                possible with foreign governments.</p>
                            <p>In consequence of this United States citizens are constantly
                                arrested, as they only give a letter of apology for it. These police
                                have thousands of photographs of thieves for whose capture high
                                rewards are offered, and if there is any resemblance they try to
                                find some excuse for searching all your papers. Some time ago a New
                                Yorker (well known) was arrested for sketching a tree in the
                                country, under the laws ordering arrest for sketching
                                fortifications. These arrests when known to one’s enemies do
                                tremendous damage, as they only tell half the story.</p>
                            <p>There ought to be a law (if our Government do not wish to enforce it)
                                holding foreign governments responsible for illegal acts of their
                                police chiefs, and also for unjustified arrests. Of course I would
                                not get large damages, as I only make $1,500 a year, but I have an
                                income of $1,500 from United States securities.</p>
                            <p>I don’t want to go to expense about this claim, but if a lawyer could
                                get a payment I would divide with him half of what I got as
                                compensation for his trouble.</p>
                            <p>I believe we are no worse off than any other nation, but it seems
                                outrageous that we can be so damaged and treated without
                                compensation.</p>
                            <p>The police only arrest people in moderate circumstances, as it is
                                more difficult to enforce a claim. I have been so upset by this
                                outrage that I can not write a decent letter yet.</p>
                            <p>Perhaps you can lend me a hand in this matter.</p>
                            <p>Believe me, etc.,</p>

                            <p>A singular incident has just occurred at Middelkerke, in Belgium,
                                where, owing to a mistake of a landlady and over officiousness on
                                the part of the police, an American gentleman, vice-president of a
                                bank, has been subjected to considerable annoyance and vexation.</p>
                            <p>It appears that he rented a room with the intention of passing the
                                season at Middelkerke. He had hardly taken possession of the room
                                when the landlady of the house sent men to remove a wardrobe which
                                had been forgotten. In shifting this wardrobe head downward some
                                jewelry, valued at 500 francs, slipped out of the top drawer and
                                fell into the body of the wardrobe.</p>
                            <p>The landlady, on finding the drawer empty, ran to the village police
                                office and brought the chief officer. This functionary rushed
                                violently at the new occupant of the room, pointed a revolver at his
                                head, and demanded, “Where have you hidden the stolen jewels?” Of
                                course, he denied all knowledge of the matter, but he was dragged
                                downstairs and handed over to a policeman, after being slapped in
                                the face by the chief. He was then conducted to various shops in the
                                place and asked where he had sold the jewels. The next step was to
                                take him to the police station, where he was stripped and all his
                                luggage searched; his private note book was scrutinized and various
                                indignities perpetrated.</p>
                            <p>His passport, photograph, and various papers of identification were
                                utterly disregarded by these village officials and the American
                                banker made to feel very uncomfortable.</p>
                            <p>At last it began to dawn upon the mind of the police that a mistake
                                had been made, and the chief said: “Well, if I am wrong I beg your
                                pardon.”</p>
                            <p>Then the landlady herself came upon the scene and apologized, for she
                                had found the missing jewels in the body of the wardrobe.</p>
                            <p>The American consul then arrived, and the denouement was the
                                discovery of a mare’s nest.</p>
                            <p>The American gentleman is naturally very indignant and is lodging a
                                claim with the Belgian Government. The moral of the story is that
                                travelers should make themselves acquainted with the furniture and
                                its contents when they occupy strange rooms in strange places.</p>

                            affairs of Belgium, to the end that if, after investigation, the facts
                            prove to be as represented, “proper reprimand and regrets” may be
                            expressed for the false arrest of said Mr. de St. Bris at Middelkerke,
                            Belgium, on June 7 last.</p>
                        <p>Awaiting the reply of the Belgian Government in this affair, I may add,
                            for the information of the Department, that when Mr. de St. Bris called
                            at the legation and stated his case he was informed that his claim would
                            be submitted to the proper authorities to the end that the policeman
                            might be reprimanded for his error and that proper regrets might be
                            expressed by the chief police for the false arrest.</p>
                        <p>He replied that he did not care whether the policeman was reprimanded or
                            not, nor did he desire to receive any expressions of regrets.</p>
                        <p>He wanted money compensation only and desired to institute a claim
                            against the Belgian Government for heavy damages.</p>
                        <p>It was pointed out to him that, as a traveler in Belgium, he was obliged
                            to conform to the laws of the country, and that as a citizen of a
                            friendly power he had the right to claim and to receive the same
                            treatment at the hands of the authorities as a citizen of Belgium.</p>
                        <p>His arrest appeared to be either due to a case of mistaken identity or an
                            error in judgment on the part of the local policeman, and did not seem
                            to be in any way due to the fact of his being an American citizen.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, and with the view of obtaining damages in the
                            form of a money compensation, his proper course would be to institute a
                            suit against the local police authorities in the civil court of Belgium,
                            in which event it would be necessary for him to employ a lawyer. As he
                            did not appear to have received any bodily injury or be incapacitated in
                            any way, it was further pointed out to him that it was extremely
                            doubtful if he would be able to obtain monetary damages in such a suit,
                            and, furthermore, that the claim for such damages, which he desired to
                            institute against the Government, would probably only result, if the
                            facts proved to be as represented, in a reprimand to the policeman and
                            an expression of regrets to him. Mr. de St. Bris replied that as he did
                            not care for regrets, and as it was only money he was after, he would
                            not press his claim.</p>
                        <p>A few days later, i. e., June 25, Mr. de St. Bris wrote a letter
                            addressed to my secretary confirming this determination of his.</p>

                                your excellency has kindly brought to my notice “the ill treatment
                                and arbitrary arrest” to which M. de St. Bris has been subjected at
                                Middelkerke on June 7 last.</p>
                            <p>As soon as I had learned of the incident in question, by means of the
                                newspapers of the time, I had on June 19 last requested my
                                colleague, the minister of justice, to collect immediately official
                                information.</p>

                                solicits has been anticipated by a reprimand which, on July 26 last,
                                my colleague, the minister of justice, caused to be addressed,
                                through the official channel, to the chief of police (Pattyn) on
                                account of the lack of tact and perspicacity which the latter
                                evinced at the time the incident occurred.</p>

                                honor to forward to you copy of the explanations furnished by the

                                notice by the minister of foreign affairs.</p>
                            <p>The attorney of the king at Furnes esteems that there are reasons to
                                acknowledge the veracity of these explanations; they concord with
                                the report of the policeman, who certifies that no ill treatment has
                                been inflicted on M. de St. Bris. On the other part, the latter has
                                left Middelkerke without making complaint; his present residence is
                                unknown.</p>
                            <p>One may reproach the chief of police because he penetrated into the
                                apartment of M. de St. Bris, holding a revolver in the hand. It can
                                only be owing to a wrong appreciation of the circumstances and to a
                                lack of judgment that this officer of police thought it necessary to
                                take an attitude which appears unjustifiable.</p>

                                13933, dated the 18th instant, Mr. Director of the Public Security,
                                has transmitted to me the same article of the same newspaper,
                                requesting also detailed information in reference to the incident
                                therein published. This is exactly what I have answered thereto.</p>
                            <p>The 7th instant, at 10.30 o’clock a. m., was introduced into my
                                office the named Proot, Remilde, aged 20, living with her parents,
                                who in a few words, which she, in a halting manner, as she was very
                                excited, made known to me that a foreigner had just rented a room at
                                her parents’ house and that some moments before her mother had just
                                noticed the disappearance of all her jewelry. She was unable to
                                furnish more detailed information.</p>
                            <p>A few minutes later I was at the house of the baker Proot, Henry,
                                from whose wife I received the following statement in Flemish:</p>
                            <p>“Yesterday evening about half past 8, this person (a man), who is
                                still in that room”—saying this she pointed to the door of the
                                latter—“came to rent the same at 30 francs per month, which sum he
                                paid in advance and for which a receipt was delivered him by my
                                husband. This room is the one my husband and myself still occupied
                                last night. Yesterday evening about 9, when we went to bed, I took
                                off my golden wedding ring, the value of which is 15 francs, and
                                placed it in the drawer of that wardrobe together with my other
                                jewelry, composed of a lady’s watch and chain in gold, worth 150
                                francs; of a necklace in gold to which was attached a cross of
                                silver adorned with diamonds, worth 100 francs; a pair of earrings
                                in silver adorned with diamonds, worth 150 francs, and also three
                                rings of which two in gold and one in silver adorned with diamonds,
                                the two former worth together 35 francs and the latter 40 francs. I
                                shut the drawer and put the key in my pocket. This morning, at half
                                past 8, this foreigner of yesterday evening, whom I regret to have
                                accepted owing to his uncleanliness, presented himself in view of
                                taking possession of his room from which we had not yet had time to
                                remove the piece of furniture containing the jewelry above referred
                                to. We gave him possession. About half past 9 this man, in whose
                                room the wardrobe was still, came downstairs and went out for one
                                hour. At his return my sons Lewis and Henry, aged 18 and 16,
                                respectively, entered the room of this foreigner who helped them to
                                remove the wardrobe, which was carried to a small room located on
                                the ground floor.</p>
                            <p>“A few moments later I opened the drawer and noticed that my jewelry,
                                which was inside the drawer in an uncovered cardboard case, had
                                disappeared. I am certain that since 9 o’clock yesterday—when I
                                still saw them—until now, nobody else but this foreigner entered the
                                house.”</p>
                            <p>Proot, Henry, 52 years old, baker, his daughter Remilde and his sons
                                Lewis and Henry above referred to, being all persons perfectly
                                honorable and all of them testifying most decidedly on the point
                                that nobody else had entered their house; besides, having verified
                                the lock which could not have been opened except by means of a false
                                key, accompanied by Proot, Henry, I entered the room of this
                                foreigner. It was then half past 11 in the morning. The latter was
                                sitting on the wooden floor, busy with warming on a small spirit
                                lamp a small portion of milk to which were added some parcels of
                                breadstuff. Not knowing with whom I might have to deal, I had, on
                                entering the room, a revolver in hand, which, after seeing with whom
                                I had to deal, I instantly replaced it in its scabbard. Having
                                brought to his knowledge the statement of Muyle, Clamence, the wife
                                of Proot, Henry, and on my interpellation this foreigner said:</p>
                            <p>“My name is de St. Bris, Thomas; I am a literary man, son of Thomas
                                and Xeres Mary, born in 1847 at Onondaga, in the State of New York,
                                North America. I have arrived here yesterday evening from Ostend,
                                where I had arrived the same day coming from Dunkirk. I have not
                                seen any jewelry in this room. The piece of furniture which has been
                                taken out this room sometime ago and which I have helped to bring
                                down stairs I have not seen inside. During the time I have been
                                absent from here I have been to a store which I can indicate, in
                                view of procuring some milk and spirits of wine to prepare my
                                breakfast. My papers are in my luggage.”</p>
                            <p>This foreigner, dressed like a real beggar and of a repulsing
                                uncleanness, was in possession of such a great deal of old dusty
                                papers that I judged it advisable—as the room which he occupied was
                                so small—to have his baggage transported to the police station. In
                                going out the residence of Proot, to walk over to the communal house
                                (police station) he pointed out to me the store where he had bought
                                the spirits of <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0102"/>wine and the
                                milk and, as it was located only a few meters from there, I went in
                                with him. There I was told that he had really been in at the moment
                                indicated, about 9.30, to buy milk and spirits of wine.</p>
                            <p>I conducted the foreigner to the police station, accompanied by the
                                policeman whom I had sent for by one of the children Proot, and who
                                had arrived at the latter’s house while the baggage of the foreigner
                                was being taken down stairs; this was at 11.30 o’clock.</p>
                            <p>I telephoned the matter to the parquet (tribunal) of Furnes. Some
                                minutes later Mr. Judge of Instruction Feys, of Furnes, asked for
                                news about the case. This magistrate informed me, while instructing
                                me to continue the investigations, that he would come up to
                                Middelkerke at 1.50 in the afternoon and that I had to keep the
                                foreigner in custody.</p>
                            <p>At my office and with his consent, Mr. de St. Bris was bodily
                                searched.</p>
                            <p>In the presence of the policeman I continued the verification of the
                                papers and the investigation of his baggage, when the steam tramway
                                arrived bringing the members of the tribunal, i. e., the judge of
                                instruction, Feys, the aid attorney of the King, De Haene, and the
                                secretary, Huyghe.</p>
                            <p>At the request of the judge of instruction, I conducted the members
                                of the tribunal to the house where the offense had been
                                committed.</p>
                            <p>After interrogating the inmates of the house, and especially the wife
                                of Proot, all of them confirming the statements made to me.</p>
                            <p>Referring to the wardrobe in question, after having carefully
                                examined the book, the judge of instruction instructed me to have
                                the drawer entirely taken out, whereupon I found between the
                                exterior panel and the drawer the jewelry which was claimed had been
                                stolen.</p>
                            <p>The members of the tribunal, who were then on their route homeward,
                                continued their way without seeing the foreigner.</p>
                            <p>I, accompanied by the plaintiff, Clemence Muyle, hastened to
                                communicate to St. Bris the news that the jewelry had been found,
                                and while shaking hands with him I expressed to him my regrets.</p>
                            <p>The wife of Proot acted in the same manner.</p>
                            <p>The 12th of the present month Mr. Consul of the “United States of
                                North America at Ghent, in view of a letter relating the substance
                                of the newspaper article herewith inclosed, came to Middelkerke for
                                inquiry. The policeman that I had sent for also protested against
                                the false insinuations contained in said letter. The persons at
                                whose house De St. Bris had been purchasing milk and spirits of
                                wine, at whose residence the consul had obtained information, have
                                told me that Mr. Consul had said to them:</p>
                            <p>“I believe that this man has not full possession of his brains.”</p>
                            <p>In reference to the slap he claims I had given him, this assertion is
                                as false as is his statement that an ovation was made him by the
                                inhabitants of Middelkerke.</p>
                            <p>When entering the town hall he was entirely alone with the policeman,
                                who walked near him, without holding him. Nobody would have supposed
                                that he was being conducted there. During that time I was watching
                                the transportation of his baggage which, at my request, was brought
                                in by the son of Proot.</p>
                            <p>Leaving the town hall, at about 2.30 p. m., nobody was standing
                                there.</p>
                            <p>Vandeworen, Hubert, a mason residing in the commune, who at my
                                request has effected the transportation of St. Bris’s baggage to the
                                Tourists’ Hotel and who was then just passing by, can certify to
                                this. The named Schefer, Adolphe, the keeper of the Tourists’ Hotel,
                                at whose house de St. Bris has had his lodgings until Saturday the
                                15th instant, can tell you much about the habits and manners of this
                                peculiar personage.</p>

                            of a letter from George Melville, an Englishman who has been imprisoned
                            at Corocoro for more than two months, accused of robbery.</p>
                        <p>As illustrating the delays mentioned in another dispatch, this case is a
                            good example. Several letters of the character inclosed have been sent
                            to this legation, and official and personal appeals made to bring
                            Melville to trial.</p>
                        <p>One main trouble is disregard of commands from the foreign office by the
                            local authorities at Corocoro. I can not determine as to the probability
                            of this man’s guilt or innocence, but believe he states the facts in his
                            letter as existing.</p>
                        <p>Similar cases are not infrequent here, and as no provision exists for
                            relief are quite distressing.</p>
                        <p>I am sending to-day a second request to his accuser, asking his influence
                            to bring Melville to trial.</p>

                            described in brief the murder outside of Cochabamba of inoffensive
                            soldiers in a church by savage Indians at the instigation of a wicked
                            priest, I have to add this most gratifying news of the exhibition of
                            justice under the rule of President Pando.</p>
                        <p>Every Indian who was captured, and when proof could be maintained of
                            guilt, was executed. The number thus punished was more than 300. The
                            priest was immediately arrested and has been in prison for two years.
                            Sentence of death has just been pronounced against him.</p>
                        <p>This retribution, exhibited in a country so isolated and so thoroughly
                            under the influence of the priesthood as is Bolivia, is a most decided
                            and encouraging symptom of liberal government, and consistent with what
                            I believe to be the honest purpose of President Pando. The influence of
                            this particular priest is very great and his merited judgment has
                            required the utmost firmness on the part of the Government.</p>

                            night of April 14, at Nictheroy, a suburb of the Federal capital
                            opposite the city and on the harbor of Rio de Janeiro, a mob sacked a
                            Baptist Mission Church. The organ, chairs, and Bibles belonging to the
                            American Baptist Missionary Association were carried into the street and
                            there covered with kerosene, which the populace ignited, making a
                            bonfire of the association’s property. This and other violence against
                            the Protestant missions is said to have been occasioned by the
                            bitterness aroused against an ex-priest whose denunciation and exposé of
                            former clerical associates greatly incensed the Catholics of Nictheroy.
                            They attributed to the effects of the ex-priest’s arraignment some
                            alleged sacrilege of an altar in one of their chapels. Then, in revenge,
                            followed attacks by a Roman Catholic mob on the Protestant missions,
                            culminating in the violence already referred to. The American pastor,
                            Rev. W. E. Entzminger, called on me to solicit my official aid in his
                            efforts to recover damages for the property destroyed. I told him that
                            before making any statement to Washington or diplomatic representations
                            here I would have an unofficial talk with Gen. Quintino Bocayuva,
                            President of the State in which Nictheroy lies. I first exacted a
                            promise from the missionary that no publicity through the press be given
                            by him or his associates prior to my intervention with the State
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>The President assured me that he had ordered the Protestant missions well
                            guarded and that they would continue under police protection. He
                            promptly asked that I direct my countryman to make a statement to him
                            personally of the losses incurred by this American Missionary Society,
                            and promised that after careful examination full redress would be made.
                            President Bocayuva expressed thankfulness that this legation had
                            endeavored to allay further excitement in this religious conflict by the
                            quiet procedure of an unofficial appeal to him, who had always advocated
                            entire religious liberty in Brazil.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: Complying with my promise to you,
                                I called yesterday on Gen. Quintino Bocayuva and I believe
                                accomplished what we desire. Reviewing the facts related in your
                                written and verbal communications regarding the attack on your
                                church and the destruction of the property of the American Baptist
                                Society, I stated that I had come unofficially to him as President
                                of the State of Rio de Janeiro before making any diplomatic
                                representations on behalf of my country people. He expressed
                                gratification at this considerate method of procedure and promised
                                that, if you would send him a statement of the losses incurred by
                                your society, he would give the same careful attention. President
                                Bocayuva said that he had ordered prompt police protection for the
                                other missions, and I inferred that he wishes that full atonement be
                                made for the outrageous attack on your church. He, however,
                                expressed indignation at the tone of the ex-priest’s utterances in
                                regard to his former religious associates. This violent talk the
                                President regarded as having provoked the lamentable attack of which
                                you and your congregation were the innocent victims.</p>
                            <p>I can not too strongly exhort my countrymen in Brazil to use
                                moderation of speech regarding the religion and institutions of the
                                land where they are living. They likewise would do well to counsel
                                their colaborers of other nationalities to pursue a like course of
                                Christian charity. I feel sure this is the policy you yourself have
                                been following.</p>
                            <p>Hoping all will come right for you, I am, etc.,</p>

                                exceptions. The list you request to be sent to the President of the

                                entirely suspended in Nictheroy from the lack of a house and the
                                necessary furniture. I can do nothing toward the equipment of

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that serious
                            disturbances occurred in Rio de Janeiro on the night of Saturday, June
                            18, and thereafter almost continuously until the night of Wednesday,
                            June 22, when quiet was at last completely restored.</p>
                        <p>Under the terms of its contract recently concluded with the Government
                            the São Christovão Street Railroad Company, one of three large companies
                            operating street-car lines in the city and suburbs of Rio de Janeiro,
                            raised its fares. Its lines serve the commercial and the poorest
                            residental portions of the city, and this increase of fares met with <pb
                                n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0111"/>determined and forcible
                            resistance. Attacks were made on the cars on the night of the 18th, and
                            some of them were burned. A large body of police succeeded in dispersing
                            the crowd of rioters, but on Sunday the disturbance continued, and on
                            Monday six cars were burned in the Largo de São Francisco, which was
                            finally cleared by the police only after several persons were wounded.
                            On Tuesday, the 22d, barricades were built in the Ouvidor and other
                            important business streets in the vicinity of the Largo de São
                            Francisco, which is an important square in the heart of the city, and
                            the streets were kept clear only by repeated charges of both cavalry and
                            infantry. On Wednesday much the same sort of occurrences took place as
                            on the preceding day, but before nightfall quiet had been restored by
                            the company’s announcement of a return to the old schedule of fares.</p>
                        <p>During the five days’ disturbance at least five people were killed and
                            the number of wounded is variously estimated at from one hundred to over
                            two hundred. In spite, however, of the serious nature of the
                            disturbances, any attempts that may have been made by disaffected
                            elements in the community to swell them into a revolutionary movement
                            were entirely abortive. Popular indignation against the company limited
                            itself to sporadic attacks on the company’s property and seemed not to
                            concern itself with the Government’s connection with the matter. The
                            police roused almost universal protest by their recklessness and
                            severity, but the only demonstrations against them were entirely
                            unorganized and almost puerile. They were apparently directed, too,
                            against the police as individuals rather than as constituted Government
                            authorities, and the only legal questions as yet growing out of the
                            disturbances have been suits instituted against individual police
                            officers and men for undue violence. The fact that order was completely
                            reestablished immediately upon the reinstatement of the old fare
                            schedule is sufficient proof that the disturbances had no political
                            significance whatever.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am in receipt of an application for a
                            passport from Isadoro Solis Marrero, a native of Porto Rico, who claims
                            to be a loyal citizen of the United States. The applicant has resided in
                            Chile since the year 1884, and now proposes to return to Porto Rico,
                            within two years, to perform the duties of a citizen there.</p>
                        <p>As section 7 of the act to provide revenues and a civil government for
                            Porto Rico, approved April 12, 1900, provides “that all inhabitants
                            continuing to reside therein, who were Spanish subjects on the 11th day
                            of April, 1899, and then resided in Porto Rico, and their children born
                            subsequent thereto, shall be deemed and held to be citizens of Porto
                            Rico, and as such entitled to the protection of the United States,” I am
                            rather doubtful whether I am authorized to issue a passport to this
                            applicant, he not residing on the island at the time specified in the
                            law. For that reason I beg to refer the matter to the Department for its

                            No. 185, of the 25th ultimo, reporting the application for a passport of
                            Mr. Isadoro Solis Marrero, a native of Porto Rico, who has resided in
                            Chile since 1884, and who proposes to return to Porto Rico within two
                            years.</p>
                        <p>You ask for instructions from the Department. In reply I have to say that
                            the language of the Porto Rican law is to be construed in its general
                            legal sense, in which continual personal presence is not necessary to
                            constitute continuous residence. A native of Porto Rico who makes it the
                            place of his permanent domicile does not, therefore, lose the benefits
                            of the act because he was temporarily abiding elsewhere when it went
                            into effect.</p>
                        <p>As regards the protection which you should accord, a Porto Rican is
                            entitled under the law to the fullest protection. The legation should
                            see that the applicant enjoys every right and that no obstacle be placed
                            in the way of his contemplated departure from Chile for Porto Rico. It
                            is deemed wise, at this time, to defer issuing passports to Porto <pb

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen</hi>: The Department has received your
                                letter of April 23, resubmitting the application for a passport of
                                Mr. Pedro A. Fernandez with corroborative testimony of two
                                witnesses, who state that he is, as he alleges, a native of Porto
                                Rico and now resident in the United States, this testimony being in
                                reply to the Department’s request therefor of April 20.</p>
                            <p>The truth of Mr. Fernandez’s allegations thus appears to be
                                established, and he is under the law entitled to the protection of
                                the United States as a citizen of Porto Rico. The precise status of
                                citizens of that island is, however, now awaiting judicial
                                definition by the Supreme Court of the United States, and the form
                                of the passport which this Department might issue in Mr. Fernandez’s
                                favor would be materially affected by the decision of the court,
                                which is daily expected. It is not, therefore, deemed advisable, at
                                this time, to issue a passport in Mr. Fernandez’s favor, but you are
                                advised that he may proceed upon his travels, and in case of his
                                requiring such protection as a diplomatic or consular officer of the
                                United States may properly render, he is authorized to apply to the
                                nearest one and present this letter as his authorization for so
                                doing.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that in
                                obedience to Navy Department’s order to the commander in chief,
                                United States naval force, Pacific Station, directing that when a
                                vessel of his command visits Valparaiso the remains of the late
                                Lieut. Selim E. Woodworth, United States Navy, be exhumed and
                                buried, I have this day buried, at sea, in position indicated by
                                latitude and longitude given above, and about 15 miles off the coast
                                of Chile, the remains of the late Selim E. Woodworth, United States
                                Navy.</p>
                            <p>On arrival at Valparaiso it was learned, through the United States
                                consul, that a law of the country prohibited the exhumation of a
                                body before the expiration of one year from the date of burial. As
                                Lieutenant Woodworth died only about six months previous, there
                                might be some difficulty in obtaining the necessary authority.</p>
                            <p>Application was, however, at once made to the intendente of
                                Valparaiso and by him referred to the minister of interior of
                                Santiago, who immediately granted my request for the removal of the
                                remains.</p>
                            <p>Lieut. G. H. Burrage, United States Navy, attached to this vessel,
                                was placed in charge to make all arrangements for the disinterment
                                and embarkation of the body, having as an assistant Dr. McCullough,
                                United States Navy. These officials engaged the same undertaker who
                                officiated at the original burial, and were thus assured as to the
                                correct location of the body, which had been placed in the
                                Protestant cemetery in a numbered cemented niche, as is the custom
                                in Chile.</p>
                            <p>On the morning of February 18, 1901, Lieutenant Burrage and Dr.
                                McCullough witnessed and attended the removal and embarkation of the
                                body. A municipal regulation required the casket to be inclosed in a
                                zinc-lined case before removal from the cemetery, and this was
                                attended to by the undertakers.</p>
                            <p>When the body was placed in the boat our flag was half-masted, in
                                which mark of respect we were joined by the Chilean squadron of five
                                vessels at anchor in the bay.</p>
                            <p>After the reception of the body on board, this vessel proceeded to
                                sea, and at 2.45 p. m. the remains of the late Lieut. Selim E.
                                Woodworth were committed to the deep with the burial service of the
                                Episcopal church, read by Chaplain Boorom, United States Navy, all
                                hands being called, and the ceremonies observed as prescribed in the
                                United States Navy Regulations. The body was left in the original
                                casket, this being inclosed in the zinc-lined case, and all sunk by
                                a heavy weight lashed securely.</p>
                            <p>In concluding I wish to call special attention to the courtesy of the
                                Chilean officials in connection with this matter. It was necessary
                                to waive the law governing disinterment, yet I everywhere met with
                                the most cordial and friendly assistance, and experienced no
                                difficulty in obtaining the necessary permit, which I herewith
                                inclose, as it may be of interest to the family of the late
                                Lieutenant Woodworth.</p>
                            <p>Very respectfully,</p>

                            instant.</p>
                        <p>The President expired on Friday evening, July 12, but as the intelligence
                            of his death was immediately communicated to the Chilean legation in
                            Washington I did not deem it necessary to do more than advise the
                            Department of the date of the funeral ceremonies, which date was
                            afterwards changed to Wednesday, the 17th.</p>
                        <p>I beg also to confirm the receipt of the Department’s telegram<note n="a"
                                xml:id="d54fnb">Printed ante.</note> of the 15th instant.</p>
                        <p>This telegram was immediately communicated to the Chilean foreign office,
                            together with a note, copy of which is inclosed.</p>
                        <p>Messages similar to that of the Department were received by all
                            diplomatic representatives here and in most cases these messages of
                            condolence were accompanied by instructions to send floral tributes in
                            the name of the executive heads of their Governments. Under the
                            circumstances it seemed to me proper to send some floral offering, and I
                            therefore assumed the responsibility of purchasing a large artificial
                            wreath, which I sent in the name of the President.</p>
                        <p>The death of the President was not unexpected. For the latter part of the
                            year he has been considered in an extremely precarious condition; fully
                            one-half of this time he has been incapable of attending to his
                            executive duties, and during the last three months he lost control
                            completely of his mental faculties. His death being anticipated for so
                            long a time rendered easy the transition of the executive power into the
                            hands of the Vice-President. The acting President, Señor Zanartu, will
                            retain the executive powers, which are in all respects equal to those of
                            the deceased President, until the newly elected President, Señor Riesco,
                            shall be inaugurated, September 18, 1901.</p>

                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: I have the honor to inform
                                your excellency that I received last evening, from the Department of
                                State at Washington, the following cablegram:</p>
                            <p>“The President of the United States conveys through you to the
                                Government and the family of the late President Errázuriz his
                                sincere sympathy.”</p>
                            <p>The above reached my hands at 6 o’clock p. m., but as I found it
                                impossible to communicate with your excellency’s department last
                                night it is only at this moment that I am able to transmit the
                                message.</p>
                            <p>I beg to assure your excellency that the deplorable loss which the
                                Government of Chile has just suffered in the death of its Chief
                                Executive, His Excellency Don Fedrico Errázuriz Echaurren, has
                                called forth the deep sympathy of the President of the United States
                                and of the Government and people thereof.</p>

                                did I not in response to the desire of the President of the United

                        <p>(Mr. Conger reports that the consular officers at Tientsin have been

                        <p>(Mr. Hay states that the United States Government favor securing foreign
                            rights at treaty ports by adequate foreign concessions, either as an
                            international settlement or as separate concessions to the interested
                            nations, but that forcible appropriation under claim of conquest is in
                            conflict with the declared purpose of the powers and disturbs their
                            harmonious action. The United States Government think the question

                            and your reply<note n="a" xml:id="d60fna">Printed ante.</note> of the
                            16th ultimo, concerning the seizure and appropriation of a large <pb

                            of war by the Russian military forces at Tientsin, I have the honor to
                            inclose herewith the correspondence between the respective legations and
                            consulates of Russia and the United States concerning it.</p>
                        <p>The Belgian consul, by direction of his minister, has also pretended to
                            occupy another large tract there. The French and Japanese have extended
                            the boundaries of their concessions, and the Austrian and Italian
                            ministers have served notice that they, too, will soon demand
                            settlements.</p>
                        <p>The Belgian minister informs me that they have no intention of a
                            settlement, but only wish a site for a consulate.</p>
                        <p>I have made the protest evidenced by inclosures herewith, because I
                            believe the action, especially of the Russians, is in violation of their
                            publicly declared intentions, and because I believe all settlements at
                            the treaty ports should be international.</p>
                        <p>The several armies came here, as they have all declared, for a general
                            purpose, and not to gain any special advantage for individual
                            governments. This “grab game,” therefore, in which they are indulging,
                            is neither fair nor consistent.</p>
                        <p>Since there are so many regularly established concessions at Tientsin an
                            international one is hardly to be expected, but all action in relation
                            to securing new or extending old concessions should be deferred until
                            order is restored, the Chinese Government reestablished, and the rights
                            and interests of all can be considered.</p>
                        <p>The notice of the Japanese consul has only just arrived, but I have
                            instructed Mr. Ragsdale to make like protest in this case.</p>
                        <p>It would be advantageous to us in many ways to have an American
                            concession at Tientsin, but we have learned by experience that it takes
                            both money and citizens to own and operate a concession. We have not
                            enough there of either. The Department is familiar with our former
                            efforts to sustain the desirable concession which had to be abandoned in
                            1896. If, however, the United States Government can in any way take upon
                            itself part of the burden, as the other governments do, it may be
                            advisable for us to demand consideration of our rights to a concession
                            while the others are taking and dividing up all available territory. If,
                            upon receipt of this, the Department desires any action taken in this
                            direction, I will thank you to instruct me by telegraph.</p>

                            <p>My <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Colleague</hi>: His Excellency
                                Lieutenant-General Linevitch, commander in chief of the Russian
                                expeditionary force in Chihli, has directed me to inform you that
                                since the 17th of June last the Imperial Chinese troops have joined
                                the rioters (Boxers) who attacked the foreign concessions and the
                                railway station occupied by the Russian troops, and that on the 23d
                                of June the Russian reenforcements, which came to raise the
                                blockade, swept the left bank of the Peiho from below the railway
                                station up to the petroleum godown of Messrs. Meyers &amp; Co., and
                                have established themselves there by right of conquest in having
                                taken possession by force of arms and at the price of Russian blood
                                spilled, in order to prevent the Chinese from returning to resume
                                the firing. His excellency considers all this tract of land included
                                in that from above the railway station to the petroleum go-down as
                                having become the property of the Russian troops on the 23d of June
                                by act of war.</p>
                            <p>The Russian flags have been planted, and notice posted upon boards in
                                many places within this territory, which has been occupied and
                                protected by the Russian military authorities. Therefore his
                                excellency can not and will not recognize, except by his special
                                authorization, any cession whatever of this territory of which he
                                has taken entire and complete possession.</p>
                            <p>It is understood that the rights of those landowners (other than
                                Chinese) whose titles have been duly registered in foreign names
                                before June 17 will be safeguarded.</p>

                                from the railway crossing, about If kilometers from the mud wall up

                                recently taken over by the Belgian consul.</p>
                            <p>I note that you have not yet protested against similar action on the

                                Americans is included. It is to be regretted that you did not at
                                once protest against the action of the Russian consul, as instructed
                                in dispatch of the 13th instant. It is rather late now, but the
                                protest should still be made (sending copy to the legation), not
                                only on behalf of any private or particular American interests, but
                                against the rights of any power to forcibly seize and hold to its
                                sole use property in an open treaty port which may be needed for the
                                use of all the powers.</p>
                            <p>If Russia, or any other power, desires a new concession, or an
                                extension of an old one, consent of the Chinese Government should
                                first be obtained, and all the public or international rights of the
                                other powers should be respected.</p>
                            <p>In this same dispatch you were requested to furnish a map showing the
                                exact location and area of these lands, which I will be pleased to

                                dispatch of November 24 inclosing circular published by the French
                                consul-general with reference to extension of French settlement, a
                                copy of which reached me from another source some days ago, and to
                                say that I hope soon to hear from you the result of your
                                investigations as to what American interests, if any, are
                                involved.</p>
                            <p>I can not understand by what right the French forcibly seize and
                                annex property to their settlement in an open treaty port, when all
                                nationalities have rights which must be respected, without obtaining
                                either the consent of the Chinese or other Governments interested. I
                                am not yet advised what individual American rights are affected, but
                                whatever they may be, you will not overlook them.</p>
                            <p>We can not agree that either the French consul or municipality can
                                pass upon the validity of any American title to property outside of
                                the legally constituted French settlement. If the French desire to
                                extend their concession, they should wait until order is restored
                                and it can be legitimately accomplished.</p>
                            <p>You are authorized to make due protest against this action, in behalf
                                of all American interests, whether private, public, or
                                international, sending me a copy of your protest.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Having reference to the circular
                                letter sent to the members of the consular body by you some days ago
                                announcing the annexation by your Government of the east bank of the

                                treaty port which may be needed for the use of all the powers. I
                                maintain, further, that if any power desires a new concession, the
                                consent of the Chinese or other governments should first be
                                obtained, and that all public or international rights of the other
                                powers should be respected.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge
                                receipt of your printed circular, dated November 22, 1900, with
                                reference to the extension of the French concession. Inasmuch as the
                                proceeding is so irregular and at variance with the usual and
                                legitimate method of acquiring concession rights, I am compelled to
                                file an earnest protest against any such arbitrary action, and I now
                                do so on behalf of all American interests, whether private, public,
                                or international. I can not understand by what right you forcibly
                                seize and annex property to your settlement in this port (where all
                                nationalities have rights which must be protected) without first
                                obtaining the consent of either the Chinese or other governments
                                interested. I can not agree that either yourself or the French
                                municipality has the right to pass upon the validity of any American
                                title to property outside of the legally constituted French
                                settlement. If you desire to extend your concession, I hold that you
                                should wait until order is restored, and then proceed legitimately,
                                keeping in mind the rights acquired by other nationalities.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The United States consul at Tientsin
                                has just informed me that on the 7th instant the Russian consul gave
                                him notice that the land fronting on the “Bund” or east bank of the
                                Peiho River, extending from and including the railroad station, to
                                Meyer’s godown, a distance of nearly 2 miles, had been taken by the
                                Russian military forces and would be reserved for the use and
                                benefit of the Russian Government.</p>
                            <p>In view of the frank declarations of the Russian Government that it
                                had no designs of territorial acquisition in China, I can not
                                believe that such action has been seriously taken, or that it will
                                receive the approval of the Russian Government.</p>
                            <p>Tientsin is an open port, and the property under consideration is
                                needed by, and should be reserved for the use of, all the powers.
                                Even in ordinary peaceful times, if foreign occupation of it were
                                necessary, it should be occupied as an international settlement,
                                such as was recently insisted upon and secured in the extension of
                                the Shanghai settlement. But now, under the present movement of the
                                allied forces in China, there are still stronger reasons why this
                                large tract of land, including, as it does, an important public
                                railway station and other property necessary for international use,
                                should not be appropriated by a single power.</p>
                            <p>I therefore take this opportunity to protest against such
                                appropriation of this property and beg your excellency to have the
                                matter investigated; and if the reported action is found true, to
                                request instructions from the imperial Russian Government which will
                                prevent any such appropriation of territory.</p>
                            <p>I improve this occasion, etc.,</p>

                                expressions which could be so construed they have certainly been

                                property at Tientsin, you say:</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Colleague</hi>: The United States consul
                                at Tientsin has just informed me that on the 8th instant the Belgian
                                consul formally notified him that the Belgian Government proposed to
                                appropriate to its sole use and benefit a considerable tract of land
                                on the east bank of the Peiho River in Tientsin.</p>
                            <p>Under the present disturbed conditions, and while this part of the
                                Empire is under military occupation, it is difficult to understand
                                how the Belgian Government can rightfully appropriate this property;
                                and believing that international settlements will better serve
                                general commerce and trade, and more adequately assure the rights
                                and interests of all foreigners than separate settlements, I am

                                instructed to desist from the proposed seizure or occupancy of said

                            <p>The imperial and royal ministry of foreign affairs has been informed
                                that several powers have recently occupied tracts of land at
                                Tientsin upon which to establish settlements or to increase those
                                which they already possess, and has directed me to <pb n="47"
                                    xml:id="pg_47" facs="0127"/>communicate the following
                                declaration to the plenipotentiaries of the foreign powers at
                                Pekin:</p>
                            <p>In order to be able to effectually protect our interests in commerce
                                and navigation, the Imperial and Royal Government considers it
                                necessary, after the restoration of order in China, to establish a
                                consulate at Tientsin, and it will require for this purpose a
                                settlement like the others already have.</p>
                            <p>For this purpose the Imperial and Royal Government has decided to
                                exact from the Chinese Government, in the course of the next
                                negotiations, a suitable tract.</p>
                            <p>In view of the recent occupations of Tientsin, the Imperial and Royal
                                Government desires now to advise in advance the foreign
                                representatives at Pekin of this intention, in order to preserve an
                                equity of rights with the other powers and to secure itself against
                                any prejudice in the question of settlements or concessions of
                                land.</p>

                                establish a consulate at Tientsin, and consequently a settlement,
                                such as the other powers already have.</p>
                            <p>In order to do so, the Royal Government may consider it necessary to
                                demand of the Chinese Government, in the course of future
                                negotiations, a suitable location.</p>
                            <p>With reference to the recent occupations at Tientsin, I beg to inform
                                the foreign representatives of this contingency, in order to reserve
                                to the Royal Government equal rights, without prejudice, with the
                                other powers, in the matter of settlements or concessions.</p>

                                possible confounding of the right of ownership of land and premises
                                within the limit of the Japanese settlement, has the honor to notify
                                that he will not recognize the validity of any transfer of right of
                                ownership of land or premises within the following limits, made
                                after the 17th of June, the day of opening of hostilities, or those
                                transfers which, although made before the above date, have not been
                                duly verified by the Chinese authorities at the time of such
                                transfers:</p>

                                papers which are self-explanatory.</p>
                            <p>Owing to recent events in this section of China and with a view to
                                the future expansion of trade by the United States at Tientsin and
                                adjacent country, I think it not improbable our Government would be
                                willing to recover, if it can be done without friction, its old
                                concession at Tientsin. Further, it might wish or consent to do so
                                for a few years at least, as a military necessity, in order to
                                afford undisputed footing for its troops and stores in case of
                                renewal of disturbance pending a few years of trial of the Chinese
                                Government to restore and maintain public order.</p>
                            <p>The papers do not disclose cost of maintenance, police, etc., which I
                                recognize is always an important element when questions of this sort
                                are up for consideration at Washington. I am not posted as to the
                                methods adopted by other nations for exploiting their holdings into
                                self-supporting condition, but I presume you are informed.</p>
                            <p>It is my opinion that our Government should recover this concession
                                if it can do so at once and without serious difficulty. I leave the
                                subject with you, however, to represent to Washington. As the matter
                                is now in such condition that delay may bring about the threatened
                                absorption before report could be made and received by mail, the
                                disposition of the Government might be obtained by using the
                                cable.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the matter of retaking
                                the old United States concession, I would state that all the land on
                                both banks of the river is now taken for a distance extending, on
                                the right bank, from the lower or south limit of the German
                                concession, north, to a point within a few hundred yards of the
                                south wall of the Chinese City, or less than a mile from the
                                junction of the Grand Canal and the river, the Japanese having
                                extended their concession, north of the French, to the point
                                mentioned.</p>
                            <p>The Italians, Austrians, and Belgians have taken territory on the
                                left bank, extending north of the Russian concession to the
                                Shui-Shih-Yeng, or Black Fort. This leaves only a space on the right
                                bank of about 1,300 feet in the old United States concession
                                available for our use.</p>
                            <p>We are now simply occupying a portion of that temporarily. It seems
                                to me important, if not necessary, that we at least definitely
                                establish the north and south line of the old concession and declare
                                our intention to hold and occupy it as long as we have troops in
                                this province. I am informed that no opposition will be made to this
                                action on our part, and such action will give us a fixed right to a
                                part of the river front that is most convenient for us and will
                                probably be very necessary when the river is open for
                                navigation.</p>
                            <p>The pontoon bridge on the river connecting our depot quartermaster’s
                                office with the corral is about the center of the concession. This
                                bridge was transferred by the Russians to the provisional government
                                of Tientsin, and I have obtained it for our use with the
                                understanding that we will guard and maintain it, the provisional
                                government to furnish boats and material that may be necessary for
                                repairs.</p>
                            <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0130"/>
                            <p>I inclose map showing in red dotted lines the limits of the old
                                United States concession, also some data furnished me by the United
                                States consul here in regard to the original status of the
                                concession.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Denby informs me that the Chinese wish the United States to
                                retake the concession, and that he has reason to believe that it can
                                be maintained in connection with that of the British, as the
                                Anglo-American concession is at Shanghai, thus reducing expenses for
                                police, etc.; also, if we do not take it, the British will.</p>
                            <p>Steps are now being taken to continue the river improvements that
                                were in progress here when the troubles commenced. The completion of
                                that work will increase the value of the land on the river
                                front.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the old American
                                concession in Tientsin, and in compliance with your request, I have
                                the honor to submit that in the year 1869 there was laid out at
                                Tientsin three tracts of land for English, French, and American
                                residents, and that for some years our Government exercised in a way
                                jurisdiction over the same.</p>
                            <p>On October 12, 1880, the concession was relegated to its former
                                status “with the understanding that if at some future time it shall
                                become desirable to establish suitable municipal regulations therein
                                it shall be competent for the consular authorities to do so.”</p>
                            <p>Under date of October 14, 1880, the Taotai Cheng acknowledged receipt
                                of the dispatch sent to him by the consul two days before, and
                                stated that if any American consul in future should “desire to have
                                the settlement revert to the present system of administration he
                                must first arrange with the customs taotai as to the mode of
                                administration, and if there be nothing objectionable in same there
                                should be nothing to prevent the settlement from reverting to the
                                original government.”</p>
                            <p>Sometime in the year 1896 a movement was on foot to cede this
                                territory to the Germans, against which action a protest was filed
                                and correspondence in relation thereto with the State Department
                                followed, and finally on April 2, 1896, the minister advised that
                                all jurisdiction over the property be abandoned, and on June 25
                                instructed the United States consul at Tientsin to advise the taotai
                                to that effect.</p>
                            <p>It has never been the policy of our Government to acquire territory
                                abroad, and that policy may be a wise one in most instances, but at
                                Tientsin I think it would be wise for our Government to have some
                                place over which they could exercise some control. The trouble in
                                North China is not over, and final settlement day is a long ways
                                off. I am glad, therefore, to learn that steps in the right
                                direction are contemplated.</p>
                            <p>I inclose you a quotation from a letter from the State Department to
                                Minister Denby in relation to the concession.</p>
                            <p>I am, etc.</p>

                            <p>As there is no record showing that any concession was ever actually
                                made to the United States, and in view of the further fact that we,
                                many years ago, relinquished whatever control we may have been
                                allowed to exercise over the land, it would seem that we are not in
                                a position to maintain that we are entitled to resume jurisdiction
                                over the tract, even if it is considered desirable to do so.</p>
                            <p>The preceding remarks are simply intended to give you the
                                Department’s understanding of this case, and it is not necessary
                                that you should do anything in the matter, at least while awaiting
                                the reply of the Chinese Government to your protest and until you
                                ascertain what the attitude of that Government will be in the

                                against the declared policy of our Government to in any way make the
                                present military movement in China a pretext for seizing or
                                obtaining territory; and it is for this reason that I have

                                concession after order is restored, we may be able to reoccupy at
                                least the small tract that was formerly the United States
                                concession, or, preferably, have it included in an international

                                already taken, you may send the inclosed, in the form of a note from

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge
                                receipt of your communication of the 21st instant, recommending that
                                some measure be taken to recover for the use of the United States
                                the former United States concession in Tientsin and setting forth
                                its necessity in a military point of view.</p>
                            <p>I agree with you that as long as United States troops are to be kept
                                in this province you should hold militarily whatever tracts of land,
                                river front, etc., you now occupy or may find necessary in the
                                future, and I see no reason why upon these grounds you should not
                                take and retain temporarily all or such portion of this old
                                concession as is necessary, and so notify your military
                                colleagues.</p>
                            <p>The emphatically declared policy of the United States is that it
                                would not make the present military movement in China a pretext for
                                securing possession of Chinese territory, and most of the other
                                Governments made the same sort of declaration, but, notwithstanding
                                this, nearly all of them have taken advantage of the situation to
                                seize large tracts or make considerable additions to their present
                                concessions at Tientsin.</p>
                            <p>I have in accordance with my instructions directed the consul at
                                Tientsin to protest strongly against all these seizures, insisting
                                that under their declared policies they could not take territory as
                                military conquest, and that during the disorder resulting from
                                military occupation, absence of Chinese Government, etc., regular
                                concessions could not be legally obtained, and that efforts in that
                                direction should be deferred until order was restored and lawful
                                proceedings could be had with a due consideration <pb n="52"
                                    xml:id="pg_52" facs="0132"/>of the rights of all the powers. Our
                                Government also favors international settlements where possible.</p>
                            <p>I have, therefore, in order to prevent the seizure of this only tract
                                left on the river and to preserve it, to be with others organized
                                into an international settlement or to be reoccupied as a United

                                colleagues the formal notice, a copy of which I inclose.</p>

                        <p>As reported in Mr. Conger’s dispatch No. 491, of December 31, 1900, and
                            No. 551, February 27, 1901, this concession was temporarily occupied by
                            us with the hope that by doing so the powers might be induced to joining
                            in an international settlement, but there now appears to be no
                            possibility of such action, at least for the present.</p>

                            reports from other sources.</p>

                                police control is concerned, and is rapidly filling up with bad
                                characters, making some control absolutely necessary. The

                                xml:id="d68fna">Printed ante.</note> of the 9th ultimo and
                            Department’s reply<note n="a" xml:id="d68fnb">Printed ante.</note> of
                            the 12th ultimo, I have the honor to report that on the 14th ultimo I
                            made formal application for the re-cession to the United States of the
                            old United States concession at Tientsin, having previously received
                            verbal assurance of a willingness on the part of Prince Ching and Li
                            Hung-chang to grant it. The matter was referred to Li Hung-chang, the
                            viceroy of this province, by the foreign office, but becaues <pb n="55"
                                xml:id="pg_55" facs="0135"/>of his illness, or for some other
                            reason, he did not reply. However, in the meantime his secretary had
                            informed me that he was giving it his attention. On the 7th instant I
                            wrote him again and received reply that he had instructed the taotai at
                            Tientsin to consult the English and German consuls and report. I
                            immediately wrote him that as this was a matter which concerned only
                            China and the United States it was wholly unnecessary to consult any
                            other governments, and that such consultation on his part was, in fact,
                            only an invitation for them to interfere, and that the United States
                            Government could not allow such interference. I also called and had a
                            personal conference the 9th instant, in which he said that after the
                            concession was surrendered by the United States it was then divided
                            between Germany and England. I knew this could not have been possible
                            and so told him, but added that if it were so that was the end of it, as
                            we were not asking a concession from England or Germany, but only from
                            China. My Government, however, would not be satisfied except upon
                            conclusive proof that such was the case. He said, of course their
                            records were all destroyed, and he only had an indistinct recollection
                            of the matter, as it was done during the viceroyalty of Wang Wen-shao;
                            but the German and English consuls must have a record of it, and that
                            was why he wished to consult them.</p>
                        <p>To-day he sent his secretary and the customs taotai of Tientsin to tell
                            me that he was mistaken; that the matter had been talked about, but was
                            not in fact given to the Germans and English, because of the opposition
                            of the China Merchants’ Steam Navigation Company and the Chinese
                            Engineering and Mining Company, who were the owners of practically all
                            the land in the tract. I told them, as I had also told Li Hung Chang
                            before, that if it was not given to the United States the Germans or
                            English would take it, and therefore it was not a question whether or
                            not these companies should be under foreign jurisdiction, but under what
                            foreign jurisdiction. They replied that the English and Germans, soon
                            after our giving it back, had agreed in writing that they would not ask
                            for it, but would leave it in control of these two companies. I said
                            that the affairs of last year had changed all this, and that had it not
                            been for the notice which I served in February last the tract would have
                            been seized before this as they have seized other property. But they
                            still urge the opposition of these two companies as an excuse, and add,
                            further, that the Chinese Engineering and Mining Company has been sold
                            out to Belgian, Russian, and French interests, and they can not
                            understand what we can want of a concession where the land is all
                            occupied, leaving no place for American merchants or business, and they
                            say that these companies will strongly suspect a design to dispossess
                            them. I insisted that all rights of property in Chinese or others would
                            always be respected under the jurisdiction of the United States. They
                            then said the taxes would necessarily be very high, and as these two
                            companies owned practically all the land, they would have all the taxes
                            to pay. I replied that even now the roads had to be kept up, policed,
                            and lighted and it would probably cost them no more then than now. They
                            answered that now the Chinese board of works improved the streets and
                            that they paid no taxes, etc.</p>
                        <p>Instead of this tract they offer and beg us to accept a much larger and
                            unoccupied tract a long way down the river, outside of all the other
                            concessions. I replied that this would not satisfy us, but that this <pb
                                n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0136"/>tract, even with its present
                            occupants, exactly suited our purpose and was the only tract we
                            desired.</p>
                        <p>They then asked if we would be willing to agree that a representative of
                            one of these companies should always have a place on the council of
                            municipal government. I replied that we desired the concession on the
                            same terms as to jurisdiction and control as concessions had been given
                            to other powers, and could take it with no other restrictions.</p>
                        <p>They finally said that the viceroy was very anxious to please the United
                            States, and would consent to giving the concession if I insisted upon
                            it, but he had sent them to explain to me all the difficulties in the
                            way and the troubles and complications which would probably arise out of
                            it. I replied that I understood it all, and if the concession was
                            properly granted to the United States we would have to meet the
                            difficulties as they arose, and at any rate they should not invite
                            difficulties and opposition by consulting these companies or anybody
                            else.</p>
                        <p>The fact is, these companies represent some of the foremost and
                            wealthiest Chinese in the Empire, and they do not wish to be turned
                            over, together with their property, to foreign jurisdiction, and the
                            viceroy does not like to brook their opposition. It is possible that
                            before the affair is concluded we shall hear of some strenuous German
                            opposition. In fact, I am not certain that they will not resurrect some
                            documentary evidence giving Germany title, because in the correspondence
                            transmitted to the Department with Colonel Denby’s dispatch No. 2559, of
                            July 10, 1896, there is a letter from the taotai, saying that he would
                            take the concession back and would then turn it over to the Germans.</p>
                        <p>I inclose the correspondence had thus far concerning the matter, and
                            have, etc.,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Highness and Your Excellencies</hi>: During
                                the occupancy of Tientsin by the allied forces many of the foreign
                                powers have taken advantage of the situation to possess themselves
                                of large tracts of territory in that vicinity for separate national
                                settlements or for other purposes. The United States has taken no
                                part in such appropriations of property, preferring to organize
                                international settlements where possible. But since this seems
                                impossible at Tientsin at the present time, and since normal
                                relations have been reestablished between the powers and China, so
                                that it may properly be done, my Government has instructed me to
                                request the recession to the United States of the very small tract
                                in Tientsin well known as the United States concession. This tract
                                comprises all the land lying between the British and German
                                concessions and extending from the Peiho River back to the Taku
                                road. The boundaries are well known and established, but at a later
                                date they can be more accurately surveyed and marked.</p>
                            <p>This concession was set apart for and granted to the United States in
                                1860 at the same time that the English and French concessions were
                                granted to them. For many years jurisdiction was exercised over it
                                by the United States consul, but on June 27, 1896, it was, for what
                                then seemed sufficient reasons, surrendered back to the Chinese
                                Government; but now conditions have so changed as to make it
                                necessary and desirable for the United States to again take it under
                                its jurisdiction. It will also be an advantage to China to have the
                                United States exercising jurisdiction along with the other
                                governments at Tientsin.</p>

                            <p>I beg to add that during a recent conversation with his excellency,
                                the Chinese plenipotentiary, Li Hung-chang, before the signing of
                                the protocol, he assured me that the act of recession should have
                                his approval and cooperation.</p>
                            <p>Trusting that this request will meet with the hearty approval of your
                                highness and that the proper local officials will be immediately
                                given the necessary instructions to carry it out, I improve this
                                first occasion to congratulate you upon the reorganization of the
                                foreign office, and to assure your highness, etc.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: On the 14th ultimo I had
                                the honor to send to his highness, Prince Ch’ing, president of the
                                foreign office, a request on behalf of my Government for the
                                recession of the former United States concession in Tientsin. His
                                highness, acknowledging receipt, informed me that the matter had
                                been referred to your excellency to be arranged. This was done in
                                pursuance of previous personal conference, in which both his
                                highness and your excellency had expressed a willingness to make the
                                recession.</p>
                            <p>It would seem, therefore, that it was only necessary to formally
                                confirm your verbal assurance and issue the proper instructions to
                                the local officials, so that I might instruct the consul of the
                                United States to again assume jurisdiction of the concession. For
                                nearly a month I have been waiting for this, and I regret that I am
                                constrained to again call the attention of your excellency to the
                                matter and request its early determination.</p>
                            <p>I improve the opportunity, etc.,</p>

                            <p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt just now of your
                                excellency’s note concerning the desire of your Government to have
                                the concession at Tientsin which was surrendered restored to them
                                and to have the local officials instructed to make the transfer,
                                etc.</p>
                            <p>With regard to this case, we some time since received the
                                instructions of the board of foreign affairs, and already on the
                                17th and 20th (September 29 and October 2) wrote to the taotai
                                appointed to inquire into concession affairs at Tientsin, Mr. Chien
                                Jung, directing him to investigate, deliberate, and decide upon the
                                matter and to send a reply. We also clearly stated to him that the
                                concession in question is situated between the English and German
                                concessions, covering the whole plot of ground situated there and
                                extending from the Peiho to the Taku road, and that since your
                                Government was anxious to have the transfer made quickly, he ought
                                to <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0138"/>consult with the English
                                and German consuls, and then, according to the old boundaries, turn
                                the territory over to the control of your honorable country, all of
                                which would be perfectly just, which is a matter of record.</p>
                            <p>Up to the present there has been no reply from Ch’ien, taot’ai, as to
                                his compliance with these orders, and I have sent further
                                instructions, urging him to make haste in dealing with the matter
                                and send reply. Aside from this, as in duty bound, I send your
                                excellency this reply, and have the honor to wish your excellency
                                all prosperity.</p>

                                acknowledge the receipt of your excellency’s note of yesterday,
                                concerning the recession to the United States of its former

                                instructed the taot’ai, Mr. Ch’ien, to consult with the English and
                                German consuls before acting in the matter.</p>
                            <p>I am greatly surprised at this, for it is entirely a matter between
                                China and the United States, in which other governments have no
                                concern, and should be settled without reference to them. Your
                                excellency has not deemed it necessary to consult the United States
                                in regard to concessions granted to other powers in Tientsin, and I
                                fail to see why an exception should be made in this case, by
                                inviting interference, which is wholly unnecessary, can not be
                                allowed by the United States, and may lead to annoying

                                and given to the British and Germans, but in fact was bought by the
                                China Merchants’ Steam Navigation Company and the Chinese
                                Engineering and Mining Company for the use of their respective
                                companies. I have directed the taot’ai, Huang, to have personal

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            dispatch, No. 769, of the 11th ultimo, confirming telegrams from and to
                            you on the subject of the recession to the United States of the former
                            American concession at Tientsin, and reporting your negotiations with
                            the Chinese Government in the matter.</p>
                        <p>In view of the unfitness of the alternatively offered tract for either
                            commercial or military use by the United States, and recognizing the
                            difficulties in the way of the restoration to us of the former
                            concession, <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0139"/>by reason of the
                            tenancies which have been established therein since its abandonment by
                            us, it seems undesirable to press the matter further at present. The
                            Government of the United States will, however, expect to have equal
                            favors and facilities with other powers for military purposes at
                            Tientsin, should it at any future time become necessary to carry out the
                            purposes of the protocol with respect to keeping open communication
                            between Pekin and the sea; and if effective assurance in this regard be
                            given we may leave the question of a commercial concession in abeyance
                            until the development of commerce in that quarter shall make it
                            necessary to claim privileges and facilities on the same footing as
                            other powers. We would feel it a duty to reserve our right in such a
                            case.</p>
                        <p>It is to be remembered that circumstances have materially changed since
                            the United States relinquished its holding at Tientsin, and that we have
                            entered into conventional arrangements, and engaged in contingent
                            obligations which may make it not only expedient, but necessary to
                            secure a position of equality at Tientsin in matters of commerce and
                            international policy, if our purposes in the direction of enlarged
                            intercourse and the maintenance of close relations of good will with
                            China as well as with the powers are to be effectively carried out, and,
                            consequently, that we can not neglect any step conducive to those
                            beneficial ends.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It is again my unpleasant duty to bring to
                            your attention what seems to me to be another effort on the part of the
                            subordinate authorities of the Treasury Department of the United States
                            to distort the language and defeat the plain intent of the solemn treaty
                            stipulations entered into between the United States and China. The
                            present case is of such a character that I feel sure you will agree with
                            me that it demands the attention of the President of the United States,
                            and the exercise of his supreme authority to bring about a proper
                            observation of these international stipulations.</p>
                        <p>The present case is one which involves the construction of Article II of
                            the treaty of 1880, which became Article III of the treaty of 1894, and
                            of section 6 of the act of Congress of July 5, 1884, passed, to give
                            effect to the treaty. The treaty guarantees to Chinese subjects, being
                            students, the right of coming to the United States and residing therein.
                            To establish the right of the Chinese student to enter the United
                            States, section 6 of the act of Congress requires that he should produce
                            the certificate described therein, giving in detail his history and
                            status, issued by the Chinese Government, and viséd or indorsed by the
                            United States consul at the port of departure of the student; and the
                            act makes it the duty of the United States consul, “before indorsing
                            such certificate, to examine into the truth of the statement set forth
                            in such certificate, and if he shall find upon examination <pb n="60"
                                xml:id="pg_60" facs="0140"/>that said or any of the statements
                            therein contained are untrue, it shall be his duty to refuse to indorse
                            the same.”</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the treaty and act of Congress, Yip Wah, a Chinese
                            subject, arrived at San Francisco, and produced the student certificate
                            above described. No allegation is made that the certificate was not in
                            due form according to the act of Congress. But the student was refused
                            admission into the United States by the collector of the port of San
                            Francisco, and, upon appeal had to the Commissioner of Immigration, the
                            decision of the collector was sustained, and unless the President shall
                            interpose his authority Yip Wah will be compelled to return to
                            China.</p>
                        <p>The grounds of the decision refusing the admission of this student are
                            set forth in the letter of the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury to
                            the collector of San Francisco, a copy of which has by the courtesy of
                            the honorable Commissioner of Immigration been furnished me, and which I
                            inclose for the information of the President and yourself. It appears
                            from this decision that a Chinese subject can not establish his
                            character as a student by showing, as an applicant for admission into
                            the United States, that he “was simply an attendant upon the native
                            schools of China,” and that he “intends to continue his studies here.” I
                            have to confess, Mr. Secretary, that such a decision sounds strange to
                            me, in view of the treaty and the law. I can not conceive of any other
                            way in which a Chinese young man can establish his right of admission
                            into the United States. But the decision makes clear what is the
                            position of the Treasury Department on this point. It appears that the
                            only evidence, other than the certificate, upon which the collector
                            based his action was the statement of the applicant himself to the
                            effect that he had been an attendant on the native schools of China and
                            that he came to the United States to continue his studies, avowedly to
                            acquire a profession, “for which he has thus far not even established a
                            foundation, being entirely ignorant of the English language.” The
                            construction thus given to the treaty and the law is that a Chinese
                            subject in order to gain admission to the United States as a student
                            must first acquire a knowledge of the English language. The further
                            declaration of the applicant “that upon his return to China he does not
                            intend to practice as a physician, but to work with his father,” who is
                            engaged in business in Canton, can not property be held to affect his
                            right of admission. This statement was made by a youth undergoing an
                            inquisition by an official of whom he stood in awe, and even if taken in
                            its fullest future application can not militate against his treaty right
                            of entrance. No suspicion is thrown upon the sincerity of his intention
                            to pursue his studies. Neither the treaty nor the law has to do with his
                            pursuit after he leaves the United States and returns to China. The
                            object of the law was to restrict the immigration of laborers, and
                            plainly the facts show that the applicant does not belong to the
                            laboring, but to an exempt, class.</p>
                        <p>I beg you, sir, to consider what effect this decision will have, if the
                            President allows it to remain as the proper construction of the treaty
                            and the law. It is in effect a requirement that all Chinese subjects,
                            coming to the United States to pursue their studies or prepare for a
                            profession must show that they possess a knowledge of the English
                            language. You are well aware of the fact that for many centuries the
                            Chinese Government has maintained an extensive system of general
                            instruction and made it the basis and test of admission to the public
                                <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0141"/>service, so that the youth
                            have great facilities for acquiring an education. But up to the present
                            there are few schools in which the English language is taught. To
                            acquire this knowledge most of the young Chinese would have to resort to
                            some school established by the missionaries, which would be repugnant to
                            the ideas of the great mass of the inhabitants, and, even if this
                            prejudice could be overcome, the places where such schools are to be
                            found are very few compared to the vast population of China. One of the
                            leading objects of Chinese students in taking advantage of the treaty
                            right to come to the United States is to acquire a knowledge of the
                            language. In the past many hundreds of Chinese young men have been sent
                            to this country, some of them by the Government, and it was understood
                            with the cordial approval of the Government of the United States, and
                            placed in school at private or Government expense, the great majority of
                            whom had no knowledge of the English language. The law of the United
                            States was the same then as now.</p>
                        <p>We read in the history of the human race that once a powerful sovereign
                            made himself infamous by requiring a foreign people to make bricks
                            without straw; that is, he ordered them to accomplish a certain task
                            without affording them the proper facilities to execute his decree. The
                            United States, it is understood, is now concerting with other great
                            powers certain measures whereby the people of China may be induced to
                            adopt such principles and methods of government society, as will make
                            them more in harmony with the Western nations. And yet, if the decision
                            which has given occasion for the present note is to be confirmed by the
                            President, it effectually closes the doors of the institutions of
                            learning in America to the great mass of Chinese students who desire to
                            come to this country to learn its language and thereby study its
                            governmental and social system, in order that on their return to their
                            own country they may profit by this education.</p>
                        <p>I inclose with the letter of the Assistant Secretary a copy of a letter
                            from the attorney in San Francisco of Yip Wah, containing an argument on
                            his part to sustain the appeal, and to which also I ask your attention.
                            With the foregoing statement I submit the case to you, feeling confident
                            that the President, with the spirit of justice which has so
                            distinguished his public life, will not allow this illiberal and
                            unreasonable decision to stand.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Under cover of your letter of 16th
                                instant the Department is in receipt of the papers on appeal in the
                                case of Yip Wah, a Chinese person who sought admission at your port
                                with a section 6 certificate as a “student,” and whom you denied on
                                November 12, 1900.</p>
                            <p>You will note by reference thereto that the act approved July 5,
                                1884, section 6, provides among other things that the certificate
                                therein mentioned “shall be the sole evidence permissible on the
                                part of the person so producing the same to establish a right of
                                entry into the United States; but said certificate may be
                                controverted and the facts therein stated disproved by the United
                                States authorities.”</p>
                            <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0142"/>
                            <p>It is noted in this case, and in others of a similar character, that
                                evidence is sought to be produced to verify the claims made in such
                                certificate in behalf of the appellant, a practice which is
                                reprehensible as being in direct contravention of the above-quoted
                                language. The certificate itself is but prima facie evidence of the
                                right of the alien to land, and it is the duty of Government
                                officers to scan the statements contained therein with a view to
                                determining whether in fact the claim of the applicant is true. The
                                only part of the examination conducted in this case by the Chinese
                                inspectors which seemed to have this end in view, rather than a
                                purpose of confirming the statements in the certificate, was the
                                examination by Inspector Lynch of the applicant himself. In the
                                opinion of the Department this examination shows that applicant was
                                simply an attendant upon the native schools of China, as any other
                                young person of that country might naturally be, but fails to show
                                that he was a student in the sense of the law. If the act is to be
                                construed as meaning that all young persons who have attended
                                schools in China are students, and therefore, upon their declaration
                                only to that effect, are to be admitted to this country upon the
                                ground that they intend to continue their studies here, it would
                                appear that the possession of such a certificate as that presented
                                by the applicant in this case would not be prima facie but
                                conclusive evidence of his right to admission.</p>
                            <p>This view of the case the Department is not prepared to entertain.
                                The applicant upon his own showing has followed the ordinary course
                                of study of young persons, and comes here professedly to acquire a
                                profession for which he has thus far not even established a
                                foundation, being entirely ignorant of the English language, and
                                asserting, moreover, that upon his return to China he does not
                                intend to practice as a physician, but to work with his father, whom
                                he states to be the proprietor of a grocery business in Canton. The
                                statement of counsel in applicant’s behalf to the effect that his
                                client is “coming here to commence and finish his education” agrees
                                with the view of the Department that applicant’s status as a student
                                in his native country is not established.</p>
                            <p>In view of the foregoing consideration the Department is of opinion
                                that your action, based upon the belief that the bona fides of the
                                applicant as a student is not established, was well taken, and the
                                appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully,</p>

                                I have this day sent to the Treasury Department in a section 6
                                student case.</p>
                            <p>It appears from the action of the collector here that he does not
                                desire to land any students at all, there being a number of cases
                                held pending a decision in this matter. It seems to me that this is
                                a direct contravention of the rights of the Chinese granted under
                                the treaty.</p>
                            <p>This matter is of vital importance to quite a number of your
                                countrymen, and I would respectfully submit that some influence be
                                brought to bear upon the Department in Washington, in order that the
                                collector at this port may be taught his duty and be prevented from
                                overriding the treaty between the United States and China.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I most respectfully submit that the
                                application of Yip Wah, ticket No. 87 “ex <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Gaelic</hi>,” October 28, 1900, for permission to land as a
                                student, should be granted.</p>
                            <p>In support of my position I contend that every requirement of section
                                6 of the treaty between the United States and China, as amended July
                                5, 1884, has been complied with. The certificate of the applicant is
                                made out in due form and contains everything required, not only
                                under the treaty, but also under the regulations of the Treasury
                                Department.</p>
                            <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0143"/>
                            <p>The applicant’s statement is uncontradicted and bears out all the
                                statements set forth in the certificate.</p>
                            <p>I most respectfully refer to a letter of the honorable Mr. Spaulding
                                to the collector at this port under date of December 12, 1899, in
                                the case Wong Hay, a Chinese student 14 years of age, in which the
                                following language is used: “In view of the youth of the applicant,
                                which would undoubtedly disqualify him for laboring work, it is
                                deemed advisable to authorize his admission, notwithstanding the
                                discrepancies referred to, and the appeal is therefore sustained. As
                                has heretofore been stated to you, the admission of adult Chinese as
                                students is not favorably regarded by the Department, but the
                                admission of Chinese youths upon section 6 certificates describing
                                them as students is more readily justifiable.”</p>
                            <p>I beg leave to quote from an opinion of Mr. M. D. O’Connell,
                                Solicitor of the Treasury, to the Secretary of the Treasury, dated
                                July 10, 1900, in the case of Li Ip, a student, in which the
                                following language is used: “The object itself challenges a general
                                spirit on the part of all who are interested in the encouragement of
                                young men who are aspiring to a higher education, especially to a
                                knowledge of our language, and so far as the ambition of the student
                                is honest and bona fide he should be freely granted all the rights
                                that the statute affords to him.”</p>
                            <p>The act of September 13, 1888 (25 Stat., p. 476), section 2,
                                certainly establishes the right beyond question of the applicant
                                herein to a landing, he having complied with the requirements of the
                                Treasury Department as set forth in pages 17 and 18 of the laws
                                issued by your Department July 10, 1899.</p>
                            <p>There is no question but what under the existing treaty between the
                                United States and China, and under all the acts of Congress, as well
                                as the regulations of the Treasury Department, the applicant herein
                                having proven beyond a doubt that he is a bona fide student, taking
                                not only the primary but the higher courses, is certainly entitled
                                to be landed, and I challenge the production of any good reason to
                                the contrary.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully submitted.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note, No. 199, of the 30th ultimo, calling attention to
                            the case of Yip Wah, a Chinese subject, claiming to be a student, whose
                            right to remain in the United States is denied by the collector of
                            customs at San Francisco.</p>
                        <p>The case having been appealed to the Treasury Department, the action of
                            the collector has been sustained by that Department.</p>
                        <p>You state that the case seems to you to be another effort on the part of
                            the subordinate officials of the Treasury Department of the United
                            States to distort the language and defeat the plain intent of the solemn
                            treaty stipulations entered into between the United States and China,
                            and you suggest that the present case is of such a character as to
                            demand the attention of the President of the United States and the
                            exercise of his supreme authority to bring about a proper observance of
                            these international stipulations.</p>
                        <p>In reply I beg to say that in the Department’s view the immigration acts
                            do not confer upon the President any power to interpose in the matter.
                            The act of August 18, 1894, provides that “in every case where an alien
                            is excluded from admission into the United States under any law or

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since my note of the 30th ultimo, in which
                            I called your attention to the case of the student Yip Wah, I have
                            received from the imperial consul-general and from reputable Chinese
                            merchants in San Francisco such urgent complaints that I feel it my
                            regrettable duty to again address you on the subject of the manner in
                            which the immigration laws of Congress are being enforced against
                            Chinese subjects.</p>
                        <p>They represent, what I set forth in my note of the 30th ultimo, that
                            under the rulings of the authorities of the port of San Francisco
                            Chinese students holding certificates in conformity to the treaty and
                            law of Congress are virtually debarred from entering the United States,
                            it being held by the said authorities that such students must come here
                            with a knowledge of the English language and with an education that will
                            permit them to forthwith enter a college or take up an advanced
                            professional course of study.</p>
                        <p>They further represent that under the act of November 3, 1893, the
                            Government of the United States issued certificates of residence to a
                            large number of Chinese persons, not laborers—merchants and others—and
                            that the rights acquired under these certificates are being entirely
                            ignored. Holders of such certificates desiring to make a temporary visit
                            to China are denied the privilege, and persons who have departed holding
                            such certificates are denied the privilege of reentering the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>They state that merchants returning to San Francisco after a temporary
                            visit to China are often imprisoned in the detention dock for weeks and
                            months pending their landing. Their Caucasian witnesses are put to all
                            sorts of inconveniences and annoyances and treated with suspicion and
                            discourtesy. When present to sigh identification papers they are
                            compelled to await the pleasure of the Chinese bureau for examination,
                            and are plied with all sorts of immaterial questions from an inspector,
                            who assumes the character of an inquisitor. The result of this is that
                            it is now very difficult for Chinese desiring to visit their native land
                            to obtain the necessary signatures for their identification papers, thus
                            causing them untold mental and financial suffering.</p>
                        <p>They report that it has been heretofore the custom in San Francisco for
                            years to allow the attorney for the persons desiring to enter the United
                            States to be present at the Chinese bureau pending the taking of
                            evidence on their behalf, thus affording a protection to the Chinese
                            applicants and operating as a restraint upon overzealous subordinate
                            officials. It has just been ordered by the port authorities that
                            henceforth no attorneys shall be allowed to be present at the taking of
                            such testimony, or of any testimony on behalf of Chinese desiring to
                            enter that port. They assert that this action makes the immigration
                            inspector, whose avowed policy is to cause the return to China of every
                            Chinese he possibly can, the master of the situation and throws all
                            Chinese applicants at his feet.</p>
                        <p>Your note of the 8th instant contains the reasons of the Treasury
                            Department for its actions. But it does not seem to me to be just that
                            these Chinese subjects, who are ignorant of the law, of the language,
                            and the customs of this country, should be deprived of the benefit of
                            counsel and placed entirely at the mercy of inquisitors, who, I regret
                            to say, are generally unfriendly if not positively hostile to them.</p>
                        <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0145"/>
                        <p>I beg to say that I was aware of the law which is quoted in your note of
                            the 5th instant, when I suggested the interposition of the President of
                            the United States, but I am advised that it can hardly be interpreted as
                            a prohibition against the exercise by that supreme official of the
                            nation of his influence with one of his own Secretaries, if he was
                            convinced, upon examination of the facts, that a solemn treaty guaranty
                            was being violated and a great wrong being done to subjects of a
                            friendly Government. I am further advised that it was not the intent of
                            Congress, by the act cited, to take from the President the duty, which I
                            have understood was imposed on him by your great and wise Constitution,
                            to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” and by the same
                            instrument the treaties with foreign nations are declared to be “the
                            supreme law of the land.” I feel persuaded that if you will lay the
                            questions presented in the present note and that of the 30th ultimo
                            before the President he will be inspired by his high sense of justice to
                            induce the honorable Secretary of the Treasury to revise the decisions
                            which have been made by the official of his Department, or that he will
                            at least submit the questions to the Attorney-General for a construction
                            of the treaty and the laws depending thereon.</p>

                            December 26 last, complaining of the manner in which the
                            Chinese-exclusion laws are enforced at San Francisco, I have the honor
                            to inform you that the Department is in receipt of a letter from the
                            Secretary of the Treasury, dated the 12th ultimo, inclosing for the
                            Department’s information a copy of a report received from the collector
                            of customs at San Francisco <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0146"/>on
                            the subject, together with a copy of a report from the Chinese inspector
                            in charge at that place.</p>
                        <p>The collector says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>I do not understand that there is now any basis for the
                                    contention that unreasonable delay is occasioned in the hearing
                                    of these cases. Heretofore, where the evidence was presented
                                    through attorneys, in many instances the continuances have been
                                    granted at the request of such attorneys. Now, however, the
                                    Government proceeds upon its own initiative, and through the
                                    Chinese bureau, to inquire into the status of each particular
                                    case as it presents itself. All reasonable efforts are made to
                                    expedite these hearings, and I believe that you will find that
                                    at the present time (February 1, 1901), and in the future, there
                                    has been and will be no unreasonable postponement in deciding

                        <p>The charge in my note of December 26 last was that the inspectors were
                            generally unfriendly, if not positively hostile, to all Chinese subjects
                            applying for admission to the United States. In my note of November 30
                            last I alleged that the subordinate Treasury officials distort the
                            language and defeat the plain intent of the treaty. I respectfully
                            submit that the facts communicated in the notes cited, as well as others
                            of previous dates, fully sustain the charges made, and afford sufficient
                            data to enable the Treasury Department to correct the conduct of the
                            officials mentioned. However, in order to comply with the request
                            contained in your note of the 2d ultimo, I asked of the imperial
                            consul-general in San Francisco further details, and I copy herewith
                            from his report: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Tang Shi Tak, who arrived here on the steamer <hi rend="italic"
                                        >America Maru</hi> December 22, 1900, ticket No. 34, applied
                                    for landing at this port as a teacher, presenting a section 6
                                    certificate issued by the Government at Hongkong. He was denied
                                    landing. It appears that he stated that he came here for the
                                    purpose of engaging in his profession as a teacher; that a
                                    certain firm in this city, giving its name, had secured for him
                                    a number of pupils. The Chinese inspector interviewed the firm
                                    referred to and they stated that they had secured for this
                                    applicant a number of pupils, giving their names and the names
                                    of their parents. The inspector interviewed the various persons
                                    named and found the statement to be true, excepting that the
                                    name of one person could not be found at the address given, and
                                    the inspector so reported. He did not, however, report that as
                                    regards the other names mentioned the statements were correct.
                                    For that reason the case was denied.</p>
                                <p>Yee Sang, a returning Salinas merchant, arriving here on the
                                    steamer <hi rend="italic">Doric</hi>, February 1, ticket No. 81,
                                    applied for admission at this port after an absence of about <pb
                                        n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0147"/>one year. He was denied
                                    landing. It appeared from his statement that he had been engaged
                                    in mercantile business for a number of years and that his
                                    business had been closed out; that he thereupon took an office
                                    and conducted the business of the defunct firm, collecting their
                                    debts and settling up their liabilities for a period of about a
                                    year. He then reengaged in business and continued in the second
                                    business for about nine months prior to his leaving for China.
                                    Proof was introduced by white witnesses that the man had been a
                                    merchant for a great many years prior to his departure for
                                    China, and the testimony of the white witnesses complied in all
                                    respects with the requirements of the Department.</p>
                                <p>In the case of Cheong In, No. 5, steamer <hi rend="italic">Nippon
                                        Maru</hi>, November 12, 1900, the applicants presented two
                                    section 6 certificates, which certificates were issued by the
                                    Government in Hongkong, in due form of law and properly viséed.
                                    They presented these certificates at this port and demanded to
                                    be landed by reason thereof. The cases were investigated by the
                                    customs officials and no statements contained in the
                                    certificates were in any way controverted. It appears that the
                                    inspector reported that neither of these parties had any money
                                    about their person, and for that reason they were denied landing
                                    at this port. It did, however, appear from the investigation of
                                    the case and the report of the customs officials that certain
                                    responsible firms in this city were indebted to the firms of
                                    which these applicants were members in China, and that upon the
                                    landing of these applicants they would collect this money and
                                    would use it, among other purposes, for engaging in business in
                                    this city. The amount was considerable, and the stores, upon
                                    being interrogated by the Chinese inspectors, corroborated the
                                    statements in every particular. The law does not require that a
                                    Chinese person seeking admission at this port should be supplied
                                    with any particular amount of money, and while it might be
                                    argued that a person arriving here without means of any kind
                                    could not well be called a merchant, that does not appear in
                                    this case, as these applicants had a credit here, or, in other
                                    words, responsible firms in this city were indebted to them in
                                    various amounts of money.</p>
                                <p>In the case of Woo Chung, No. 10, steamer <hi rend="italic"
                                        >Coptic</hi>, December 14, 1900, this applicant also
                                    presented a section 6 certificate duly issued by the Government
                                    at Hongkong and claimed to be a merchant and a member of the
                                    exempt class. No fact in his certificate was controverted by the
                                    Government officials. In his statement he claimed that what
                                    money he needed in this country for the purpose of going into
                                    business would be furnished him by a certain firm in this city.
                                    That firm was interrogated and corroborated the statement of the
                                    applicant, and at the request of the then acting collector of
                                    this port the amount of money which the applicant claimed he
                                    needed was by the firm placed in the form of a certificate of
                                    deposit and exhibited to the collector, who expressed himself as
                                    fully satisfied with the case and that the applicant was what he
                                    claimed to be. This was a day or two before the expiration of
                                    the term of office of the then acting collector, and when the
                                    matter was brought up again before the present collector upon a
                                    recommendation of Mr. Dunn in this case it was denied, following
                                    the recommendations of Mr. Dunn in all cases, good, bad, and
                                    indifferent.</p>
                                <p>Cases similar to these could be repeated as long as one had
                                    patience to listen to them; but these seem to me fair examples
                                    of returning merchants and section 6 cases merchants who have
                                    been unlawfully denied admission at this port.</p>

                        <p>I trust that the foregoing additional facts may be brought to the
                            attention of the honorable Secretary of the Treasury, in the hope that
                            he will issue such instructions as will bring about a more rational and
                            exact compliance with the letter and spirit of the treaty stipulations

                            11th instant, in which you quote from a communication of the Chinese
                            consul-general at San Francisco reports of certain cases in which it is
                            charged that the United States officials at that place, upon whom
                            devolves the duty of enforcing the Chinese exclusion laws, have been
                            guilty of improperly refusing admission to Chinese immigrants, I have
                            the honor to inform you that the Department is in receipt of a letter
                            from the Secretary of the Treasury, dated the 17th instant, in which he
                            says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Department finds, upon reference to its files, that each and
                                    all of the cases cited by the Imperial consul-general to sustain
                                    the charges referred to were appealed to this Department, and,
                                    after a careful review of the evidence transmitted therewith,
                                    the action of the said officers was sustained, except in one
                                    instance, that of Tang Shai Tak, whose claim to be a teacher,
                                    and therefore within the exceptions provided for by the
                                    convention of December 8, 1894, was duly allowed, and he was
                                    therefore permitted to land.</p>
                                <p>The Department is of course not aware of what information the
                                    Imperial consul-general may have in his possession bearing upon
                                    the charge of impropriety on the part of the officials at San
                                    Francisco, but inasmuch as his letter, extracts from which are
                                    contained in the note of the Chinese minister, shows simply that
                                    in his judgment they had acted in disregard of the preponderance
                                    of evidence, and charges nothing against them other than that,
                                    their action in that respect does not appear to require further
                                    investigation, since it was ratified as above stated. Mistake or
                                    prejudice on the part of the said officials, if such is shown,
                                    may always be corrected by appeal, when each case will be

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am informed by the Chinese consul at
                            Honolulu that the collector of customs at that port has refused
                            permission to a Chinese student to land for the purpose of pursuing an
                            education. The person so refused is reported to me to be a boy aged 15
                            years, Tong Tseng, who arrived at Honolulu by the steamer <hi
                                rend="italic">Gaelic</hi> on October 21, bearing with him a proper
                            certificate, issued to him by the British Government of Hongkong and
                            viséed by the United States consul-general at that port. His application
                            for permission to land was rejected by the collector of Honolulu, as I
                            am informed, not because his certificate was not properly made out or
                            that he was not a student, but because when questioned the boy answered
                            that his purpose in coming to Honolulu was to pursue his studies at the
                            Chinese-American school. His friends and the American principal of the
                            school interested themselves on his <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69"
                                facs="0149"/>behalf and offered to give a guaranty or bond for the
                            good faith of the boy, but their offer was refused by the collector, who
                            stated that his instructions from the Treasury Department were that only
                            those Chinese who intend to pursue some of the higher branches of study
                            or for some particular profession could be admitted.</p>
                        <p>I am advised that an appeal has been taken to the Secretary of the
                            Treasury, and that the boy is detailed at the quarantine station
                            awaiting the Secretary’s decision. In view of this action it becomes my
                            duty to ask your kind intervention with your honorable colleague, the
                            Secretary of the Treasury, to the end that the treaty between the two
                            Governments may not be violated in this case.</p>
                        <p>In examining the opinion of the Solicitor of the Treasury upon which the
                            ruling of the collector is based I find that he defines a student to be
                            “a person who (1) intends to pursue some of the higher branches of
                            study, or one who (2) seeks to be fitted for some particular profession
                            or occupation for which facilities of study are not afforded in his own
                            country; one (3) for whose support and maintenance in this country, as a
                            student, provision has been made, and who (4), upon completion of his
                            studies, expects to return to China.” (Regulations relating to exclusion
                            of Chinese, 1900, p. 35.)</p>
                        <p>May I venture the assertion that this definition with its various
                            conditions reads very strangely in contrast with the simple phrase of
                            the treaty? Suppose such a clause as that just quoted had been proposed
                            for insertion in the treaty, can you, Mr. Secretary, for a moment
                            believe that the Chinese negotiator would have accepted? I think you
                            will agree with me that the officials of one of the parties to a treaty
                            can not attach conditions to its stipulations which that party would not
                            have proposed in the negotiations and which the other party would not
                            have entertained.</p>
                        <p>If the construction given by the Treasury officials is to be maintained
                            by your Government, you must admit that it is a virtual nullification of
                            the treaty. Under this ruling a Chinese student can only be admitted to
                            the United States to pursue a course of study for a profession or
                            occupation “for which facilities of study are not afforded in his own
                            country.” Any one at all familiar with China must know that there were
                            in existence in that Empire when the treaty was made institutions of
                            learning where instruction is given in English and Chinese in almost
                            every branch of education—in medicine, in divinity, in international law
                            and the science of government, in civil and mining engineering, in the
                            science of navigation, in the military art, and in the other various
                            branches of sciences and belles-lettres.</p>
                        <p>It is not a sufficient reason to give to the application of a Chinese
                            student who comes to the United States to make himself more perfect in
                            English to say that there are facilities in the place of his home, in
                            China, or Hongkong, where he can learn this language. There are
                            throughout the United States, in every city and town, teachers of the
                            French and German languages, but I understand that it is a common
                            practice among the well-to-do American families to send their children
                            to France or Germany, at great expense, to acquire a more perfect
                            knowledge of the tongue there spoken.</p>
                        <p>It would be just as proper and well founded a reason upon which to base
                            the rejection of a Chinese student to enter the United States for the
                            study of medicine or theology to say that there are institutions in
                            China for such study.</p>
                        <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0150"/>
                        <p>The Solicitor of the Treasury must know that many centuries before the
                            nations of northern Europe began to give attention to education the
                            Chinese Empire was the seat of learning, with a literature and art which
                            is even to-day the admiration of the western countries. And it is
                            because of the thirst of the Chinese youth for knowledge that, with the
                            modern facilities for travel and exchange of ideas, they seek admittance
                            to the schools of this enlightened nation. It is the same spirit which
                            has taken so many American youths to Paris, Berlin, and other seats of
                            learning. No such line is drawn upon the young men of this country when
                            they land in France or Germany.</p>
                        <p>Anyone at all conversant with the social conditions of China must know
                            that there is a broad and well-marked distinction between the student
                            and the laboring classes. The authorities who give the certificate and
                            the consul who visés it can readily discriminate between them. But in
                            the present case there is no question as to the genuineness of the
                            certificate or the status of the applicant. The boy is to be rejected
                            and sent back on his long journey because he could find the same
                            facilities for education at his home that he seeks in Honolulu.
                            Certainly, Mr. Secretary, you and your enlightened colleague, the
                            Secretary of the Treasury, must admit that the reason for this decision
                            is unjustifiable and in violation of the treaty. I hope, therefore,
                            that, actuated by the spirit of fairness which has so distinguished your
                            official conduct, you will lay the present case before your colleague
                            and urge him to give to the appeal his personal attention, in the full
                            assurance on my part that he will overrule the unreasonable decision of
                            the collector at Honolulu.</p>

                                rend="italic">Gaelic</hi> in last October, be permitted to land, in
                            a decision given on the 10th instant on his appeal. I beg to express my
                            appreciation of the justice of the course pursued by the Treasury
                            Department in this case, and to request that you will kindly convey my
                            thanks to the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
                        <p>As to the slight confusion caused by the different spelling of the boy’s
                            name, referred to by the Secretary of the Treasury, this is due partly
                            to the dialectic variation in the Chinese pronunciation of the name and
                            partly to the imperfect representation of the Chinese sounds by English
                            letters. The Secretary of the Treasury is right in assuming that it is
                            one and the same boy, whether his name is given as Tong Tseng or Tong
                            Chong.</p>

                            <p>Attorney-General Griggs, in an opinion addressed to the Secretary of
                                the Treasury, dated the 15th of July, 1898, says:</p>
                            <p>“It maybe stated, comprehensively, that the result of the whole body
                                of these laws and decisions thereon is to determine that the true
                                theory is not that all Chinese persons may enter this country who
                                are not forbidden, but that only those are entitled to enter who are
                                expressly allowed.”</p>
                            <p>In pursuance of this opinion, the Treasury Department issued
                                instructions to collectors of customs in the following terms:</p>
                            <p>“Collectors of customs are directed to admit only Chinese whose
                                occupation or station clearly indicates that they are members of the
                                exempt class of Chinese named in Article III of the treaty with
                                China, viz, ‘Chinese subjects, being officials, teachers, students,
                                merchants, or travelers for curiosity or pleasure,’ and to deny
                                admission to Chinese persons described as salesmen, clerks, buyers,
                                bookkeepers, accountants, managers, storekeepers, apprentices,
                                agents, cashiers, physicians, proprietors of restaurants, etc.”</p>
                            <p>To deny admission to other classes of Chinese than laborers is
                                clearly contrary to the letter and spirit of the laws and treaties
                                respecting the immigration of Chinese to the United States and to
                                the uninterrupted practice of the Executive Departments of the
                                United States for a period of sixteen years from 1882 to 1898.</p>
                            <p>Since the issuance of the instructions by the Treasury Department, in
                                pursuance of Attorney-General Griggs’s opinion above referred to,
                                the rights of even the so-called exempt classes of Chinese have been
                                constantly ignored and denied by officers of the United States
                                Government charged with the execution of the laws, as may be seen in
                                the following cases:</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Case I</hi>.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lew Yuk Lin, acting consul-general of China at Singapore, in the
                                Straits Settlements, and Commander Chen En Tao, naval attaché to the
                                Chinese legation at London, were proceeding via Vancouver, Montreal,
                                and New York to London, England, on the business of the Imperial
                                Government. They arrived at Malone, N. Y., on the evening of
                                December 26, 1899, and were met on the train by Mr. J. Gibbs and Mr.
                                F. G. Shufelt, deputy collectors at Malone. These officers informed
                                them that they had received telegraphic instructions from the
                                collector at Plattsburg, N. Y., to detain them at Malone until
                                instructions could be obtained from the Treasury Department at
                                Washington. The two Chinese officials endeavored to satisfy the
                                deputy collectors of their status as officials of the Chinese
                                Government by exhibiting to them their credentials and, in addition,
                                certificates issued to them by the British authorities at Hongkong
                                and Shanghai, and by the United States consul-general at Hongkong,
                                showing conclusively their official character and their right to
                                exemption from the operation of the exclusion laws. To their great
                                surprise and in spite of their protest, <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73"
                                    facs="0153"/>the deputy collectors insisted upon detaining them,
                                and they were forced to get off the train and pass the night in a
                                hotel. For over twenty-four hours they were kept under surveillance
                                and were not allowed to continue their journey until remonstrance
                                had been made by this legation and telegraphic instructions received
                                from Washington. Even then no satisfaction was tendered them for the
                                inconvenience and extra expense they had been thus put to by reason
                                of their detention and for the great humiliation and indignity to
                                which they had been subjected.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Case II</hi>.</p>
                            <p>Fei Chi Ho and Kung Hsiang Hsi, two Chinese students, arrived at San
                                Francisco September 12, 1901, by the steamer <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Doric</hi>, in the charge of Miss Luella Miner, a teacher in
                                the North China College of the American Board of Foreign Missions at
                                Tungchow, near Peking. They had passports certifying to their status
                                as students, issued by Earl Li Hung Chang, viceroy of the province
                                of Chihli, and viséd by Mr. Ragsdale, United States consul at
                                Tientsin. According to Miss Miner’s statement, Fei Chi Ho studied
                                first in the primary schools and then for eight years in the North
                                China College and Academy, where he graduated in May, 1898. From
                                that time until the Boxer outbreak in the summer of 1900, he taught
                                in the Boys’ Boarding Schools at Taiku and Fenchow, in the province
                                of Shansi. Kung Hsiang Hsi is a native of Taiku, in Shansi, and
                                studied many years in the mission school there. In 1896 he entered
                                the North China College and Academy, and had completed the junior
                                year when he returned to his home in Shansi in June, 1900, expecting
                                to return and finish his college course the following year. Both
                                these young men were in Shansi at the time of the general outbreak
                                against foreigners in that province, and were conspicuous for their
                                devotion and faithfulness to their American friends, whom they
                                refused to desert, though for weeks they were repeatedly surrounded
                                by Boxer mobs. When the last of the missionary bands was killed on
                                August 14, 1900, Fei Chi Ho escaped, and, after unspeakable
                                hardships, made his way to Tientsin, bringing the first authentic
                                tidings of the fate that had befallen the Shansi missionaries. His
                                father, mother, and other relatives were killed by the Boxers. The
                                other young man, Kung Hsiang Hsi, was intrusted by the two American
                                ladies, Miss Bird and Miss Partridge, a few days before their death,
                                with letters to their friends. These he concealed for twelve months,
                                at the risk of his life, before it was possible for him to carry
                                them over the borders of the province of Shansi. He had with him
                                also a few articles from the personal effects of Miss Bird for her
                                mother.</p>
                            <p>To these young men the collector of customs at San Francisco refused
                                admission on the ground that their passports were not in proper
                                form. The entreaties of Miss Miner and the intercession of the
                                Chinese consul-general at San Francisco in their behalf were of no
                                avail. They were ordered to be deported. The case was appealed to
                                the Treasury Department, which confirmed the decision of the
                                collector. As they were in imminent danger of being sent back to
                                China, it was arranged, at the last moment, through the intercession
                                of an influential friend, that the young men should be permitted to
                                land on the bond of the Chinese consul-general at San Francisco,
                                pending their sending to China for the proper certificates.</p>

                                character as student, but because when questioned he answered that
                                the purpose of his coming to Honolulu was to pursue his studies at
                                the Chinese-American school. His friends and the American principal
                                of the school exerted themselves in his behalf, and offered to give
                                a guaranty or bond for the good faith of the boy, but their offer
                                was refused by the collector, who stated that his instructions from
                                the Treasury Department were that only those Chinese who intend to
                                pursue some of the higher branches of study or prepare themselves
                                for some particular profession could be admitted.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Case IV</hi>.</p>
                            <p>Yee Ah Lum and some thirty Chinese merchants of Canton came to the
                                United States in August, 1899, for the purpose of buying American
                                goods. Their applications <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0154"/>for
                                admission into the country were rejected by the collector of customs
                                at San Francisco on the ground that their certificates were
                                defective. The alleged defect was simply the omission of the
                                particulars respecting the nature and character of their business in
                                the English portion of the certificates, though such particulars
                                were plainly stated in the Chinese portion. Thereupon Yee Ah Lum and
                                the other Chinese merchants appealed to the Secretary of the
                                Treasury, but the Secretary sustained the decision of the collector.
                                They were accordingly deported. It was afterwards learned that they
                                went to Europe to make their purchases.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Case V</hi>.</p>
                            <p>Tom Kem Poy and Wong Sun Chune were two Chinese merchants who had
                                been in business a number of years at Mazatlan, Mexico, as members
                                of the firm of Simon Ley &amp; Co. Armed with certificates from the
                                Mexican Government, properly viséed by the American consul at the
                                port of departure, and also with a certificate from the registrar of
                                commerce of Mazatlan showing that they were merchants of good
                                standing, they came to Los Angeles, Cal., in February, 1899. On
                                their arrival the Chinese inspector arrested them, and threw them in
                                jail, because, as he testified at the preliminary examination of
                                these men, he had felt their hands, and therefore knew that they
                                were not merchants. They were in jail from February 6 to June 1,
                                when their attorney wrote to this legation, and in all probability
                                had to remain there to the day of their deportation, which was not
                                ordered till August. Thus they were kept in jail for seven months
                                for no crime or fault whatever.</p>

                                on the 11th of November, 1898, by the steamer <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Whitney</hi> for New Orleans with the intention of proceeding
                                to San Francisco, where he had an interest in the firm of Tai Seng
                                Tong, doing business at 929 Dupont street, San Francisco. Upon his
                                arrival at New Orleans the customs authorities refused to let him
                                continue his journey. His passport was in due form, issued by the
                                Chinese consul-general at Habana, and viséed by the British consul
                                acting in behalf of the United States Government as well as by the
                                Spanish governor of the province at that time. His detention was due
                                to a new regulation of the Treasury Department, issued in pursuance
                                of an opinion of the Acting Attorney-General, withdrawing the
                                official recognition up to that time accorded to Chinese consular
                                certificates.</p>

                            <p>Ho Mun, a native of the Portuguese city of Macao, born of Chinese
                                parentage and a merchant of good standing, arrived at San Francisco
                                by the steamer <hi rend="italic">Coptic</hi> on September 17, 1899,
                                and applied for admission to the United States by presenting a
                                certificate issued by the proper Portuguese authorities at Macao and
                                viséed by the United States consul-general at Hongkong. His
                                application was rejected on the ground that his certificate failed
                                to state the length of time for which he was engaged as a merchant
                                in Macao before his departure for the United States. Accordingly, he
                                was removed to a place of detention on the steamship company’s dock
                                in the custody of the customs authorities to await orders for his
                                deportation. Almost immediately afterwards he fell sick. Every
                                effort was made by his friends and relatives to give him the
                                necessary medical care and attention, but the customs authorities
                                and particularly Inspector Dunn, who was in charge of the Chinese
                                bureau, refused all entreaties that a regular physician should be
                                allowed to examine and attend the sick man. For two months Ho Mun
                                remained in the place of detention, and his condition grew worse and
                                worse from day to day. As a last resort, an application was made to
                                the district court of the United States in and for the northern
                                district of California for a writ of habeas corpus, which was
                                granted on the 16th of November, 1899, and Ho Mun was taken from the
                                custody of the custom authorities, and removed to the county jail,
                                where he died on the 21st of November.</p>
                            <p>The foregoing are typical cases taken from a large number. They serve
                                to show the nature of the hardships entailed upon even the members
                                of the exempt classes of Chinese by the harsh enforcement of the
                                exclusion laws. These certainly do not seek the American shore for
                                the purpose of wresting the daily bread from the mouths of American
                                wage earners, but for the purpose of promoting a friendly
                                understanding <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0155"/>and improving
                                the commercial relations between the two countries. It is true that
                                instances of fraudulent attempts to enter the country are not
                                wanting. But innocent Chinese who have every right to come to the
                                United States should not be treated as suspicious characters and
                                sent back to China as lawbreakers on the least pretext.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In view of the fact that the law of the
                            Congress of the United States which went into force May 6, 1882, based
                            upon the treaty of 1880 between China and the United States, regulating
                            Chinese immigration, and which was reenacted May 5, 1892, for ten years,
                            is about to expire by limitation, and as the treaty now in force
                            relating to Chinese immigration will terminate in 1904, I have been
                            instructed by the Imperial Chinese Government to bring the subject of
                            this law and the treaties to the attention of the United States, and to
                            urge an adjustment of the questions involved more in harmony with the
                            friendly relations of the two Governments and with the interests of
                            their respective peoples.</p>
                        <p>The treaty of 1880 (Article IV) provides that if the laws of the Congress
                            of the United States to carry out the treaty “are found to work hardship
                            upon the subjects of China, the Chinese minister at Washington may bring
                            the matter to the notice of the Secretary of State of the United States,
                            who will consider the subject with him * * * to the end that mutual and
                            unqualified benefit may result.” The matter which now presses itself
                            upon our consideration is whether the laws now in force “are found to
                            work hardship upon the subjects of China,” and whether they ought to be
                            renewed or modified by the Congress. As the subject is one of the utmost
                            importance to my Government and my people, I must entreat your patience
                            while I attempt to review it at some length and in detail. In doing so
                            it will be necessary to repeat some of the facts and arguments which
                            have already been submitted to you, in order that a full and connected
                            presentation of the subject may be made for the consideration of the <pb

                            transmitted to the honorable Congress.</p>
                        <p>In seeking to discharge this duty I shall ask your attention, first, to
                            the diplomatic history of the treaties upon which the laws of the
                            Congress are based; second, to an inquiry somewhat in detail whether
                            these laws have worked hardships to the subjects of China; third,
                            whether they have proved to be for the best interests of the United
                            States in an economic aspect and in its commercial relations with China;
                            and, fourth, whether, in view of their early expiration, they should be
                            reenacted; and, if so, to what extent of territory they should be
                            applied and what modifications are called for by experience in their
                            enforcement.</p>

                        <p>In 1868 the governments of China and the United States celebrated a
                            treaty which guaranteed to the Chinese subjects visiting or residing in
                            the United States the same privileges, immunities, and exemptions as
                            were enjoyed by the citizens of the most favored nation. It was a treaty
                            negotiated by the great American statesman, Secretary Seward. It was
                            announced by the President of the United States to Congress to be a
                            “liberal and auspicious treaty” (Dip. Cor. U. S., 1868, p. 16), and it
                            was welcomed by the people of the United States as a great advance in
                            their international relations. It also has the double significance of
                            having been negotiated by a Chinese special embassy, of which a
                            distinguished American diplomat, Hon. Anson Burlingame, was the head,
                            and who was familiar with the wishes and interests of the American
                            people.</p>
                        <p>Some delay was occasioned in its ratification by the Chinese Government,
                            and upon the advent of a new President, General Grant, his Secretary of
                            State, Mr. Fish, manifested a marked zeal and anxiety to secure its
                            ratification, with a full knowledge on the part of the Government that
                            it was to secure the free entrance of Chinese laborers into the United
                            States, whose coming by “thousands” he welcomed. In urging the minister
                            of the United States to hasten final and favorable action, he wrote:
                            “Already they (the Chinese immigrants) have crossed the great mountains
                            and are beginning to be found in the interior of the continent. By their
                            assiduity, patience, and fidelity, and by their intelligence, they earn
                            the good will and confidence of those that employ them. We have good
                            reason to think that this thing will continue and increase.” (Wharton’s
                            International Digest, I, p. 457.)</p>
                        <p>Under such circumstances the Imperial Chinese Government was pleased to
                            meet the wishes of the Government of the United States, and it put the
                            treaty into full force and operation with the expectation that it would
                            be the means of unrestricted commercial and industrial intercourse and a
                            bond of union and friendship between the two great peoples for many
                            generations to come. But within a few years the labor unions on the
                            Pacific coast began to object to the coming of Chinese laborers to that
                            region to compete with them. Soon afterwards the Chinese Government was
                            surprised to be informed that the President of the United States had
                            delegated a commission of its citizens to go to Pekin and solicit an
                            abrogation of the treaty clause, to which reference has been made.
                            Although the Imperial Government was resolutely opposed to its
                            abrogation, it received the American <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77"
                                facs="0157"/>commission with all the respect due to their Government
                            and to their high station, and listened patiently to their
                            representations. The commissioners admitted that the treaty of 1868 gave
                            the Chinese the absolute unrestricted right of immigration to the United
                            States in any numbers, but they represented that the conditions had so
                            changed since the treaty was negotiated, or that its operation had been
                            so unexpected in its results, that the interests of the American people
                            demanded that the treaty clause in question should be annulled.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Government was still unwilling to abrogate a treaty which had
                            been urged with so much zeal by the United States and which had so
                            lately been entered upon on both sides with such high hopes. Thereupon
                            the commissioners proposed that in view of the disturbances created in
                            the United States by the operation of the treaty, permission be given
                            the Government of the United States, in its discretion, “to limit,
                            suspend, or prohibit” the immigration of Chinese laborers. To this
                            proposition the Chinese Government objected as a virtual abrogation of
                            the treaty, but it did indicate a disposition to intrust to the
                            Government of the United States the power “to regulate, limit, or
                            suspend” such immigration, if the power to “prohibit” was stricken out,
                            and if assurance could be given by the commissioners that the discretion
                            to be granted to the United States would be judiciously and reasonably
                            exercised.</p>
                        <p>The American commissioners accepted the proposal of the Chinese
                            Government as fair and adapted to the situation of affairs, and they
                            proceeded to give the assurance requested by the Chinese Government in
                            the following terms: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>It would be as difficult to say what would be the special
                                    character of any act of Congress as it would be to say what
                                    would be the words of an edict of the Emperor of China to
                                    execute a treaty power. That the great nations discussing such a
                                    subject must always assume that they will both act in good faith
                                    and with due consideration for the interests and friendship of
                                    each other. That the United States Government might never deem
                                    it necessary to exercise this power. It would depend upon
                                    circumstances. If Chinese immigration concentrated in cities
                                    where it threatened public order, or if it confined itself to
                                    localities where it was an injury to the interests of the
                                    American people, the Government of the United States would
                                    undoubtedly take steps to prevent such accumulations of Chinese.
                                    If, on the contrary, there was no large immigration, or if there
                                    were sections of the country where such immigration was clearly
                                    beneficial, then the legislation of the United States under this
                                    power would be adapted to such circumstances. For example, there
                                    might be a demand for Chinese labor in the South and a surplus
                                    of such labor in California, and Congress might legislate in
                                    accordance with these facts. In general, the legislation would
                                    be in view of and depend upon the circumstances of the situation
                                    at the moment such legislation became necessary. * * * They
                                    further remarked that they were satisfied that if any special
                                    legislation worked unanticipated hardships the Government of the
                                    United States would listen in the most just and friendly spirit
                                    to the representations of the Chinese Government through their
                                    minister in Washington. (U. S. <ref target="frus1881#pg_185"

                        <p>These assurances were accepted by the Chinese Government as satisfactory
                            and, at its request, they were reduced to writing. That Government was
                            not, however, satisfied that the word “prohibit” should be merely
                            stricken out of the treaty draft prepared by the American commissioners;
                            but to the words “regulate, limit, or suspend” it required that there
                            should be added the words “but not absolutely prohibit it” (Chinese
                            immigration). The further words were also added, “the limitation or
                            suspension shall be reasonable.” By such friendly explanations and
                            language was it sought to make clear what was the intent and scope of
                            the new and amended treaty.</p>

                        <p>A further incident of this negotiation is proper to be noted. In the
                            American project of the treaty it was provided that “the words ‘Chinese
                            laborers’ are herein used to signify all immigrations other than that
                            for teaching, trade, travel, study, and curiosity.” Such a clause would
                            have excluded from the United States a large class of Chinese not
                            enumerated, and it was wisely stricken out and not included in the
                            treaty as accepted.</p>
                        <p>In transmitting the immigration treaty of 1880, as finally adopted, to
                            the Secretary of State, the commissioners say: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>It would seem reasonable to expect that in yielding so fully to the

                            interest of and at the demand of the labor unions on the Pacific coast,

                        <p>Within a period of less than ten years an urgent application was made by
                            the Secretary of State for a new treaty amendment so as to enable the
                            Congress of the United States to still further restrict the privileges
                            of the Chinese laborers who had come to the United States under the
                            solemn pledge of treaty guaranties. And when the Chinese Government
                            hesitated to consent to the withdrawal of rights granted by the United
                            States to the subjects of all other Governments the Congress of the
                            United States passed the Scott Act of 1888, in plain violation of the
                            treaty. In order to save the Executive of the United States from
                            embarrassment, the Chinese Government, contrary to its own sense of
                            justice and of international comity, for a third time yielded to the
                            wishes of the United States, and celebrated with it the amended treaty
                            of 1894, which gave to Congress additional power of legislation
                            respecting Chinese laborers.</p>
                        <p>How far Congress has complied with the letter and spirit of the treaties
                            and of the assurances given by the American commissioners who went to
                            Pekin, may be seen by an examination of the various laws which have been
                            passed ostensibly to carry out the stipulations of the treaties, and the
                            rulings of the Departments in the enforcement of these laws. They have
                            been made the subject of many communications of this legation to you,
                            Mr. Secretary, and the archives of your Department will show how futile

                        <p>I have shown that when the Chinese plenipotentiaries were induced to
                            agree to the exclusion of Chinese laborers from the United States the
                            American commissioners held out the hope that possibly it might not be
                            exercised at all, or, at most, under certain limitations and as to <pb
                                n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0159"/>specified localities. But
                            immediately after the treaty went into effect a law was passed making
                            the exclusion of Chinese laborers complete as to the entire territory of
                            the United States and without exception.</p>
                        <p>Let us now examine in some detail whether the assurance given by the
                            American commissioners who negotiated the treaty of 1880 that the power
                            to enact laws under the treaty would be “exercised with a wise
                            discretion, in a spirit of reciprocal and sincere friendship, and with
                            entire justice” has been realized.</p>
                        <p>It is an undeniable fact that the treaties of 1880 and 1894 had for their
                            sole object the exclusion of Chinese laborers, but the laws and Treasury
                            regulations have included in this category classes of skilled artisans
                            and traders. Restrictions and definitions are thrown around the term
                            “merchant,” “student,” and others not laborers, which, as I shall show,
                            make it very difficult for these classes to enter the United States. The
                            Treasury Department, in accordance with an opinion of the
                            Attorney-General, excludes from the United States all persons who are
                            not expressly described in Article III of the treaty of 1894. This
                            action I claim to be in direct opposition to the treaties, to the laws
                            of Congress, and to the whole history of the events which gave rise to
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The preamble to the treaty of 1880 shows that it was entered into at the
                            request of the United States, and the reason therefor is stated to be
                            “because of the constantly increasing immigration of Chinese laborers.”

                            affects or threatens to affect the interests of that country, to
                            regulate, limit, or suspend such coming or residence;” but it provides
                            that “the limitation * * * shall apply only to Chinese who may go to the
                            United States as laborers, other classes being not included in the
                            limitations.” Then follows in the next article the enumeration, which
                            substantially appears in the treaty of 1894, as to “officials, teachers,
                            students, merchants, or travelers for curiosity or pleasure.” The treaty
                            of 1894, in its preamble, recites the object of the treaty of 1880 and
                            gives as the reason for its amendment “the antagonism and much
                            deprecated and serious disorders to which the presence of Chinese
                            laborers has given rise.” Thereupon it amends Article I of the treaty of
                            1880, under which the immigration of Chinese laborers could be
                            suspended, but not absolutely prohibited, by authorizing their absolute
                            prohibition for ten years, and it amends Article II as to Chinese
                            laborers, under which they were “allowed to go and come of their own
                            free will and accord,” by restricting their return to the United States
                            by the terms set forth in Article II of the new treaty. A provision not
                            found in the treaty of 1880 is added as to registration of “Chinese
                            laborers;” but in no other respects is the treaty of 1880 modified or
                            affected by the treaty of 1894, except as already stated respecting the
                            certificate to be given to Chinese subjects residing in foreign lands.
                            It repeats in Article III the recital of “officials, teachers, students,
                            merchants, or travelers for curiosity or pleasure,” but expressly states
                            that their right of coming to the United States is under the status “at
                            present enjoyed”—that is, under the treaty of 1880. In the Chinese text
                            of Article II of the treaty of 1880 and of Article III of 1894 the words
                            “officials, teachers, students, merchants, or travelers for curiosity or
                            pleasure” are followed by the words “et cetera,” which clearly shows the
                            intention of the negotiators and confirms my argument on this point.</p>

                        <p>Not only does the treaty and all the correspondence leading up to it show
                            that the intention was to exclude Chinese laborers only, but the various
                            laws of the Congress of the United States are in absolute confirmation
                            of this intent. Section 6 of the acts of 1882 and 1884 refers to those
                            who must produce the required certificate as “every Chinese person other
                            than a laborer;” the penalty in section 2 of these acts imposed upon
                            vessels only applied to the bringing of “Chinese laborers;” under the
                            act of May 5, 1892, registration is only made obligatory as to “Chinese
                            laborers;” and the act of October 1, 1888, known as the Scott Act, the
                            most drastic legislation ever passed by Congress, was expressly limited
                            to “Chinese laborers.” Under these acts it never was held by the United
                            States authorities that admission of the exempt classes was confined to
                            those only who are recited in Article II of the treaty of 1880, and the
                            present exclusion can not justly be based upon the fact of the recital
                            of Article III of the treaty of 1894, for the same recital appears in
                            the treaty of 1880. The force and effect of the legislation of Congress
                            is well stated by the Supreme Court of the United States in its opinion
                            in the case of Wan Shing <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. United States (140 U.

                                <p>The result of the legislation respecting the Chinese would seem
                                    to be this, that no laborers of that race shall hereafter be
                                    permitted to enter the United States, or even to return after
                                    having departed from the country, though they may have
                                    previously resided therein and have left with a view of
                                    returning; and that all other persons of that race, except those
                                    connected with the diplomatic service, must produce a
                                    certificate from the authorities of the Chinese Government, or

                                    certificate is to be viséed by a representative of the

                        <p>It thus appears by the declaration of this high tribunal that the only
                            test to be applied to a Chinese seeking admission into the United States
                            is whether or not he is a laborer. If the negative shall be established
                            in the manner prescribed by the laws, to wit, by the production of the
                            proper certificate, the person must be admitted.</p>
                        <p>The construction given to the law by the Supreme Court is that which was
                            followed up to a recent period. The Secretary of the Treasury at that
                            time, the Hon. John G. Carlisle, in the regulations of 1893, published
                            for the enforcement of the laws of the United States respecting the
                            Chinese, made the following declaration for the guidance of the officers
                            of the United States: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>No class of Chinese are prohibited from coming into the United
                                    States or remaining there, except such as may properly and
                                    within the meaning of said statutes be known as “laborers.” (See
                                    series 7, No. 18, U. S. Internal Revenue, 1893, p. 9.)</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It is needless for me to say to you that Mr. Carlisle is not only a
                            statesman intimately acquainted with the spirit and policy of his
                            Government, but that he is one of the first lawyers of his country.
                            After the treaty of 1894 went into effect—that is, in 1896—new
                            regulations were issued from the Department of the Treasury, signed by
                            the Acting Secretary, the Hon. Charles S. Hamlin, to whose Bureau
                            Chinese matters specially belonged, and in which the declaration above
                            quoted appears with this additional statement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The persons referred to in the acts of Congress to which these
                                    regulations apply, and whose immigration into the United States
                                    is prohibited, are limited to Chinese laborers. (See
                                    regulations, 1896, p. 9.)</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0161"/>
                        <p>Thus it will be seen that from the passage of the first exclusion act in
                            1882 until July 15, 1898, when the opinion of the Attorney-General above
                            referred to was given, for a period of sixteen years the prohibition to
                            enter the United States was distinctly confined to Chinese laborers
                            only, other classes not being included in the prohibition. But under the
                            opinion of the Attorney-General none but those expressly enumerated in
                            Article III of the treaty of 1894 are allowed admission into the United
                            States. It is most unreasonable to suppose that such was the intent of
                            the negotiators. Did they contemplate the admission of students and the
                            exclusion of scholars, when there are such in China of the most eminent
                            attainments, professors and philosophers, worthy to rank with the
                            distinguished savants of America or Europe? Did they propose to admit
                            merchants, however small their business, and reject bankers, of whom
                            there are in China many possessed of millions, and turn away brokers or
                            commercial agents, of whom there are not a few in China managing the
                            business of the largest commercial houses and banking companies of
                            Europeans? Was it probable that they should provide for the admission
                            and residence in the United States of tens of thousands of Chinese
                            laborers and prohibit the entrance of physicians to care for them? Would
                            they stipulate for the coming without limit of mere travelers, however
                            lowly, for curiosity, and refuse the stay of noblemen or men of high
                            professional standing? To state these questions is to refute them.</p>
                        <p>Not only a large class of Chinese of education, high rank, and business
                            standing have thus been excluded by a simple ruling of the Treasury
                            Department, but such obstructions and conditions are by the Immigration
                            Bureau thrown around the admission of those who are recognized as
                            entitled to enter the United States as in many cases amount to a virtual
                            nullification of the treaty. That convention expressly stipulates that
                            students, without qualification, are to be admitted. And yet the
                            Treasury Department proceeds to neutralize this privilege by a ruling
                            that defines a student to be “a person (1) who intends to pursue some of
                            the higher branches of study, or who seeks to be fitted for some
                            particular profession or occupation (2) for which facilities of study
                            are not afforded in his own country; (3) for whose support and
                            maintenance in this country, as a student, provision has been made, and
                            (4) who, upon completion of his studies, expects to return to China.”
                            (Regulations, 1900, p. 35.) It would sound strange to read in a
                            dictionary of the English language the only definition of student to be
                            “one who pursues a super graduate course and is provided in advance with
                            a competency.” And yet such is the interpretation of the word of the
                            treaties which is followed by the Immigration Bureau. It will be seen
                            that four conditions are attached to the admission of a Chinese student
                            into the United States, not one of which is warranted by the treaty. The
                            effect is that the doors of American universities and colleges are
                            practically closed to the Chinese race.</p>
                        <p>Merchants are among the enumerated classes in the treaties entitled to
                            admission and residence in the United States, and yet so many
                            restrictions are applied to their entrance and residence that in many
                            instances they amount to a violation of the treaty. Merchants and others
                            of the exempt class are required, under the law, upon reaching the
                            United States to produce certificates setting forth a series of facts as
                            to their past lives, occupation, and standing in China. But this
                            certificate, <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0162"/>duly viséed, is not
                            accepted as sufficient evidence of their right to enter. They are
                            subjected to a most searching examination by the customs officials. At
                            San Francisco, where most of them arrive, they are lodged in the loft of
                            a wooden house awaiting this examination. It is practically an
                            imprisonment, lasting sometimes for weeks and even months. They are not
                            allowed to see their friends. Cases are reported where persons have
                            become sick and no docter was allowed to see them, and deaths have
                            occurred.</p>
                        <p>In the examination or inquisition above noted the merchant, student, or
                            other of the exempt class is compelled to answer a great variety of
                            questions and to give an account of his past life, and if any of his
                            answers are inconsistent with the statements in the certificate, or for
                            any other cause they create suspicion as to their correctness, the
                            applicant is refused admission and compelled to return to China. The
                            manner of these examinations is reprehensible. Men and women are
                            examined alone, neither their friends nor a lawyer in their behalf being
                            allowed to be present, and the interpreter is generally a foreigner.
                            There are so many dialects of the Chinese language that one interpreter
                            can not understand them all. Hence misunderstandings often arise and
                            injustice is inflicted, whereas if a competent interpreter, who
                            understood the particular dialect spoken by the applicant, should be
                            allowed to be present misunderstanding and consequent injustice would be
                            avoided.</p>
                        <p>The certificates are required to be in the English language, but they
                            also appear in duplicate in Chinese. The customs inspectors take
                            advantage of every technicality to reject them, even when there is no
                            evidence of fraud. It is made by law the duty of the United States
                            consul at the port of departure in China “to examine into the truth of
                            the statements set forth in said certificate,” and to refuse to visé the
                            same if not found correct. Yet if a certificate duly viséed by the
                            consul is presented with the omission of a single particular in English,
                            though it may appear in the Chinese text, it is rejected.</p>
                        <p>To illustrate the extreme severity with which the officials carry out the
                            law, I cite one or two recent cases. Last year several merchants came to
                            San Francisco with a good supply of money and credit to make purchases.
                            They were provided with the legal certificates viséed by the American
                            consul, but it appeared that in their certificates some parts of their
                            former career were not filled up in English, although properly filled up
                            in Chinese. The objection was raised by the customs authorities that the
                            certificates were defective. It was contended on their behalf that the
                            law was complied with, as every detail was mentioned in the certificate,
                            although some of it was only in Chinese, and it was offered to supply
                            the omission in the English from the Chinese text, but the authorities
                            would not allow it. The case was appealed to the Treasury Department,
                            and the decision of the San Francisco authorities was confirmed. It was
                            of no avail that these merchants had come 10,000 miles, that their
                            certificates were quite sufficient as far as the Chinese text was
                            concerned, and that the American consul who viséed the document was at
                            fault in not seeing that all the parts were filled up in the English
                            text. It was suggested that the merchants be released under bonds and
                            that their certificates be sent back to China for correction. There was
                            no suspicion of fraud, yet the suggestion was not heeded, and these
                            merchants were compelled to return to China. It was afterwards stated
                            that they went to Europe to purchase their goods.</p>

                        <p>One more case will be sufficient to illustrate the manner in which the
                            law is applied. During the present year a boy of 16 years of age, sent
                            by his father, a merchant of good standing in Shanghai, to this country
                            for the obvious purpose of finishing his education, and armed with a
                            proper certificate, applied to the collector of custom, at Malone, N.
                            Y., for admission into the United States. His application was rejected
                            and he was obliged to return to China, notwithstanding the assurance
                            given by the Chinese consul at New York of the bona fide student
                            character and purpose of the boy. The ground upon which he was denied
                            admission was not because there was any doubt as to the genuine student
                            character of the boy, but simply because of the statement found in his
                            certificate, which had been duly viséed by the United States
                            consul-general at Shanghai, that the boy’s intention of coming to the
                            United States was “to study the English language.”</p>
                        <p>The examination above stated is not the only inconvenience of that
                            character to which merchants and others are subjected. They are kept in
                            confinement pending inquiries set on foot by the customs inspectors.
                            These inquiries are often made in a surreptitious manner; the applicants
                            for admission are not afforded an opportunity to confront those who give
                            damaging information against them or to rebut their statements. The
                            report of the inspector is decisive as to their admission or deportation
                            to China, and their only remedy is an appeal to the Secretary of the
                            Treasury in Washington, which is virtually to the Commissioner of
                            Immigration. The report of the inspector is ex parte, and the applicant
                            can only support his appeal by ex parte affidavits, as no judicial
                            hearing or orderly examination by counsel is allowed. The Treasury
                            officials on appeal, however fair-minded they are, have no opportunity
                            of hearing witnesses or taking fresh evidence, and usually disregard the
                            affidavits and accept the report of the inspector. Would it be
                            inappropriate for me to say that such a proceeding seems like a travesty
                            of justice?</p>
                        <p>To send a Chinese back upon his arrival in this country is a great
                            hardship, especially when it is based upon technicalities often without
                            merit. It means to him loss of business, of money, and of time, as well
                            as blighted hopes. The result is sometimes fatal.</p>
                        <p>There are other hardships suffered by Chinese subjects seeking admission
                            to the United States, which are not so much the result of injustice on
                            the part of officials as the laws and regulations adopted ostensibly to
                            enforce the treaties. As already mentioned, the law of Congress requires
                            of merchants and others coming to the United States a certificate
                            authenticated by the United States consul at the port or place of
                            departure. At many places in China whence they depart there is no
                            American consul. Most of the Chinese go to Hongkong to ship for this
                            country. It is impossible to obtain there the required certificate, it
                            being a British port, and they not being residents of that place. It has
                            been held by the Treasury Department that Chinese coming from a foreign
                            port must procure the certificate of the authorities of that port, and
                            that the certificate of the Chinese consul there is not sufficient. In
                            most instances it is not possible for the authorities of the foreign
                            port to make out the certificate giving the facts required by the law.
                            The only -person who could do so is the Chinese consul, and under the
                            construction given to the law by the Treasury Department this officer is
                            not permitted to give the certificate, and the Chinese seeking to come
                            to the United States from such foreign ports suffer great
                            inconvenience.</p>
                        <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0164"/>
                        <p>I have thus far referred to the hardships suffered by the Chinese
                            merchants and others in securing the admission to the United States
                            which they are guaranteed by the treaties. But after they have overcome
                            these obstructions thrown in their way by the customs officials, they
                            are constantly liable to annoyances and hardships while resident in the
                            United States at the hands of these officials. To some of these I beg to
                            call your attention. Chinese residing in the United States are often
                            annoyed and harassed by overzealous inspectors and United States
                            marshals, who, without a word of warning, surround a community of
                            Chinese, herd them together, and demand the immediate production of
                            their registration certificates or other proofs of their right to remain
                            in the country; and if no such evidence is found on their persons they
                            are placed in confinement until a tedious process of investigation is
                            gone through and their right to remain in the United States is proved to
                            the entire satisfaction of the inspector or other officer of the law, as
                            the case may be. Even merchants well known locally in the city or town
                            they reside in are not exempt from this mode of inquisition, to the
                            detriment of their business and annoyance personally.</p>
                        <p>One of the glaring incidents of the kind was that of Hong Sling, a
                            merchant of Chicago, who, while visiting Decatur, Ill., last year, was
                            pounced upon by a United States officer and challenged to show proof of
                            his right to be in the country. He gave his name, place and character of
                            his business, and other evidence of his character as a merchant,
                            including a letter signed by the Hon. Mr. Gage, Secretary of the
                            Treasury, certifying to his standing as a merchant personally known to
                            him. But the officer was not satisfied, and threatened immediate arrest
                            unless a legal certificate was produced, although the law required the
                            registration of laborers only and made registration of merchants
                            voluntary on their part. After thorough search of his own baggage, Hong
                            Sling finally succeeded in finding his certificate, which he happened to
                            have taken along with him. Then kicking him and abusing him, the officer
                            permitted him to go on his way, greatly humiliated in the presence of a
                            large crowd that had gathered around him.</p>
                        <p>Chinese lawfully residing in this country can not pass over the boundary
                            without getting proper papers by filing an application one month prior
                            to their departure. Some Chinese, not knowing this regulation, have been
                            caused hardships. Inconvenience is caused when a Chinese is suddenly
                            called away from the United States. Instances have occurred where
                            Americans taking Chinese servants with them out of the United States,
                            and not having time to file application as required, have not been
                            permitted to bring their servants back on their return.</p>
                        <p>Merchants doing a large business for many years in this country and
                            desirous of sending for members of their families in China can not do so
                            unless they themselves return to China to get the necessary certificate.
                            Neither the Chinese minister nor a Chinese consul is permitted to issue
                            the certificates. This also works great hardships to many Chinese in
                            this country.</p>
                        <p>Registered Chinese laborers when they go back to China on a visit are
                            obliged, unless the time is extended, to return within a year. In case
                            they want the time extended, they have to send their papers back to this
                            country to be certified by the Chinese consul at the port of departure.
                            The papers are often lost on the way, and there does not seem to be any
                            way of replacing them. In any case, it is a tedious proceeding and
                            liable to vexatious delays.</p>
                        <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0165"/>
                        <p>Chinese merchants, who have a settled business in this country, are often
                            denied landing upon their return from a visit to China or elsewhere on
                            the least pretext. Consequently their business has to suffer, in
                            addition to the heavy expense they are put to in appealing their
                            cases.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing somewhat tedious statement of the hardships suffered by the
                            Chinese who seek admission to and residence in the United States,
                            because of the laws of Congress and the regulations of the Treasury
                            Department, might be enlarged did it seem necessary. But I think the
                            cases cited are sufficient to demonstrate that the spirit and intent of
                            the treaties are being defeated. It further shows, I am sorry to say,
                            that the officials of the Government of the United States, to whom is
                            intrusted the enforcement of the laws, treat the Chinese, not as
                            subjects of a friendly power lawfully seeking the benefit of treaty
                            privileges, but as suspected criminals, and that merchants, students,
                            and others clearly entitled to residence in the country do not receive
                            the courtesy and consideration due them, but are looked upon as
                            offenders and suspects, and treated as such. It is not becoming in me to
                            laud the merits of my own people or to claim for them undue
                            consideration. I may, however, without impropriety, recall the language
                            of the President of the United States, who properly interpreted the
                            spirit and desires of my Government, when Congress at an earlier period
                            sought to legislate in an unfriendly manner. He said: <quote

                        <p>Having discussed the diplomatic history of the treaties and laws of
                            Congress, and examined how far and in what manner these laws work
                            hardships to the Chinese, I come now to consider the question whether
                            they have proved to be for the best interest of the United States in an
                            economic aspect.</p>
                        <p>If the present laws have worked for the best interest of the United
                            States, this fact would furnish a very strong reason for their permanent
                            retention upon the statute books. If they have not worked for the
                            interest of the United States, then it must be admitted that a change is
                            not only desirable but absolutely necessary. It is not the desire of the
                            Chinese Government in making this communication to enter into any
                            argument concerning this matter, but the sole purpose is to furnish in
                            as succinct a form as possible some of the facts upon which the Chinese
                            Government bases its belief that the laws in question have worked injury
                            to both countries.</p>
                        <p>A brief history of the events which led up to the troubles culminating in
                            the exclusion of Chinese laborers from the United States may be of value
                            in understanding this question.</p>
                        <p>In 1844 five ports in the Chinese Empire were opened to American commerce
                            under a treaty negotiated by Caleb Gushing. The commerce of the United
                            States with the ports of China grew rapidly. As already stated, in 1868
                            the Burlingame treaty was entered into and ratified by both countries,
                            under the terms of which the right of Chinese to immigrate <pb n="86"
                                xml:id="pg_86" facs="0166"/>to the United States was admitted, and
                            the promise was made that the subjects of China should enjoy the same
                            privileges, exemptions, and immunities respecting travel and residence
                            as the subjects of the most favored nation. At that time the Pacific
                            railroads were being built across the western part of the United States,
                            and other large enterprises were projected on the Pacific coast. Labor
                            on the Pacific coast was very scarce, and in frequent instances day
                            laborers received higher wages than were paid to skilled artisans in the
                            eastern part of the United States. There was then no alien
                            contract-labor law on the statute books of the United States, and the
                            railroad companies sent their agents to Canton and contracted for many
                            thousands of Chinese.</p>
                        <p>This influx of Chinese labor naturally attracted a great deal of
                            attention in certain quarters. The labor agitators feared that the
                            scarcity of labor from which the far West had suffered would be at an
                            end, and that wages would be reduced. The attention of Congress was
                            called to the Chinese question, and instead of passing an alien
                            contract-labor law, as was done later, that body attempted the
                            restriction of Chinese immigration. A bill was passed restricting the
                            immigration of Chinese and was vetoed by President Hayes; the veto being
                            accompanied by a message so convincing that I take the liberty of
                            attaching a copy<note n="a" xml:id="d85fnc">Not printed.</note> of it
                            and request your honorable Government to give it the consideration which
                            is its due. (See inclosure No. 3.) The excitement in the West had been
                            taken advantage of by what were known as “sand-lot” politicians, led by
                            Dennis Kearney. These men, it will be remembered, precipitated riots in
                            which a number of Chinese were killed. A careful examination of the
                            records in the State Department will not disclose a single instance in
                            which the Chinese were the aggressors. The Pacific coast States, I am
                            informed, were very evenly divided politically at that time, and both of
                            the great political parties were forced to declare against the Chinese.
                            For no party without taking such a stand could have won the support of
                            those who then held the balance of power in California and Oregon. It is
                            not to be wondered at, therefore, that Congress again attempted to
                            settle this question by the exclusion of Chinese laborers. They passed
                            such a bill. It was vetoed by President Arthur by the special message of
                            April 4, 1882, which reviews the history of Chinese immigration and the
                            restrictions sought to be placed upon it. A copy<note n="a"
                                xml:id="d85fnd">Not printed.</note> of this message is attached
                            hereto, to which attention is directed. (See inclosure No. 4.) This
                            Congress shortly afterwards passed a bill restricting Chinese
                            immigration, which became a law. It was not so stringent as subsequent
                            legislation, but it was an opening wedge for the Scott law of 1888,
                            followed by the Geary law of 1892. In 1894 the last treaty concerning
                            this subject was entered into, and was considered by the Chinese
                            Government as a somewhat favorable modification of the Geary law. A
                                copy<note n="a" xml:id="d85fne">Not printed.</note> of this treaty
                            is likewise attached hereto. (See inclosure No. 5.)</p>
                        <p>The arguments against the admission of Chinese to the United States are
                            well known and can be very briefly stated; it is claimed that the
                            Chinese will work for less wages than the American workman; it is
                            claimed that the population of China consisting of 400,000,000 people
                            would, if immigration were unrestricted, overrun the United States <pb
                                n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0167"/>and destroy its institutions; it
                            is claimed that the Chinese do not come with the intention of becoming
                            citizens, but return to China as soon as they acquire sufficient means
                            to establish themselves in the country of their nativity; and it is
                            claimed that their standard of living is so low that they consume
                            practically nothing and add but little to the purchasing element of the
                            community.</p>
                        <p>There has now been a period of nineteen years of partial and total
                            exclusion of Chinese laborers. Of this there have been thirteen years of
                            total exclusion and six years of partial exclusion, preceded by a period
                            of unlimited admission of the subjects of the Chinese Empire. It is an
                            easy matter to trace the comparative effect of unlimited immigration,
                            partial exclusion, and total exclusion.</p>
                        <p>I will first take the question of labor. The rates of wages for the
                            different periods are taken from the Fifteenth Annual Report of the
                            Commissioner of Labor of the United States. The average rate of wages
                            for labor in California in 1870, with unrestricted Chinese immigration,
                            was $2 per day. It remained stationary at this rate until 1884 when,
                            under partial restriction of Chinese immigration, it was raised to $2.31
                            per day. Immediately upon the passage of the act of 1884 the average
                            wages dropped to $1.70. In 1893, the first year after the passage of the
                            Geary law, the average wages in California for laborers was $1.73 per
                            day. After the passage of the Geary law wages for labor in California
                            steadily declined until in 1898 the average was only $1.59 per day.
                            These figures are official and prove conclusively that the exclusion of
                            Chinese has not had the effect of raising wages where Chinese labor is
                            employed.</p>
                        <p>The fact is that Chinese labor does not compete and never has competed
                            with American labor, but supplements American labor and is of advantage
                            to it. It is not difficult to explain why this is so. The Chinese are
                            not skilled in the lines of industry in which wages are highest in the
                            United States. They are skilled in those lines of labor in which the
                            United States is deficient. They are agriculturists and thoroughly
                            familar with agricultural products which the Department of Agriculture
                            has by successful experiments demonstrated are easily grown within the
                            United States. The successful tea garden in South Carolina would be only
                            one garden out of thousands instead of an isolated curiosity, if the
                            Chinese immigration law should be expunged from the statute books. The
                            successful silk farms in Louisiana and California would no longer be
                            unique, and the United States would become an exporter of raw silk. The
                            present development of the rice industry in the States of Louisiana and
                            Texas would be but a start toward the reclamation of the swamp lands of
                            the United States, and the possibilities in this direction could
                            scarcely be estimated beforehand. The reports of the Land Commissioner
                            of the United States show that less than one-half of the area of the
                            United States is now under cultivation. In the line of agriculture alone
                            more Chinese could be used in the United States than would emigrate to
                            this country in a century. The rate of wages paid to Chinese laborers
                            would be paid according to the value of the productions as is now paid
                            to American labor, and as the Chinese people are not skilled in the
                            industrial lines prominent in the United States and are not adapted to
                            those employments they would enter into competition with no American
                            labor but would organize for themselves new lines of labor and new
                            occupations according to their training in the country of their
                            nativity. They <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0168"/>came to the United
                            States when the laundry business was not only in its infancy but
                            practically unknown. They made it a great industry, not only for
                            themselves but for Americans. The cut-rate laundries are American
                            laundries. In no city are the cheapest rates to be found in the Chinese
                            laundries. The same may be said of domestic service.</p>
                        <p>It is claimed that the population of China consists of 400,000,000
                            people. It is very doubtful whether this is a correct estimate, as no
                            accurate census has ever been taken of the population of China. A
                            reference to the reports of the consuls of the United States holding
                            official posts in China and of immigration statistics will show that all
                            the immigration into the United States from China has come from the
                            single province of Kwangtung (Canton), which has a population of about
                            25,000,000; of this population only about 5,000,000 live in those
                            districts which solely supply Chinese immigrants. The reason for this is
                            to be found in the character of the Chinese. The Chinese is averse to
                            travel and not inclined to emigrate from China. This is shown by the
                            fact that while every country in Europe has thrown its doors open to
                            Chinese immigration, it is very rare that a Chinese is found in any of
                            the European countries. The wages in those countries are very much
                            higher than the wages in China, and there is no barrier whatever to
                            prevent the Chinese from going to Europe, but they do not go. The reason
                            they come to the United States is that they have friends and relatives
                            in this country, and are therefore sure of assistance in making a start
                            in the New World. Even the desire to come is not so extensive as might
                            be expected, as is shown by the census periods. In 1860 there were
                            34,933 Chinese in the United States; in 1870 there were 63,249; in 1880
                            there were 105,465; in 1890 there were 107,488; and in 1900, 89,863. It
                            will be seen that at the time of the prohibition of the immigration of
                            Chinese the Chinese population had not increased as rapidly as the
                            American population. Instead of having more Chinese in proportion there
                            were not as many. In the entire ten years from 1880 to 1890 the Chinese
                            population of the United States increased by only 2,023. In the last ten
                            years, ending with 1900, the Chinese population had decreased by 17,625.
                            These facts and figures should at once put a stop to the fallacious
                            though popular argument that this country would be in imminent danger of
                            being overrun with millions upon millions of Chinese should the bars of
                            exclusion be let down.</p>
                        <p>The next objection, that the Chinese do not acquire citizenship, is a
                            peculiar one. They are not allowed by the laws privileges accorded to
                            the people of other countries of becoming naturalized. If they were
                            accorded the same privileges as other people, many of them would become
                            citizens; but if they should not it would not be against the interests
                            of the United States. It is a matter of notoriety that the Swedes and
                            Norwegians have settled in certain communities and there obtained
                            control of local politics. The same is true of the people of other
                            countries. It is certainly not very desirable that a foreign element
                            should have control of American politics, and that is the main effect of
                            naturalization. The fact that the Chinese do not seek to interfere with
                            the internal affairs of the country of their residence ought to count in
                            their favor.</p>
                        <p>In 1890, which was the year in which a census was taken nearest the year
                            when the Chinese were excluded, the census reports show that out of
                            82,329 prisoners in the United States only 407 were Chinese. And <pb
                                n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0169"/>out of 73,045 paupers in
                            almshouses in the United States only 13 were Chinese. An analysis of the
                            offenses for which the Chinese were convicted shows that they were
                            practically all of a petty nature. The Chinese by the census of 1890
                            show the smallest percentage of criminals and paupers of any nationality
                            within the United States.</p>
                        <p>The objection that the standard of living of the Chinese is lower than
                            that of the Americans can not now be sustained. The Chinese, owing to
                            the overcrowded condition of their country, have in times past lived
                            very cheaply. But should a commission examine into the facts it could be
                            proved that contact with other more extravagant countries has very
                            greatly modified the habits of the Chinese in this particular and has
                            led them to acquire many new wants. This largely accounts for the great
                            increase in the Chinese trade. If the Chinese did not want anything more
                            than he did a hundred years ago he would not buy any more, but the
                            statistics show that his purchases are increasing more rapidly than
                            those of the inhabitants of any other country. An inquiry directed to
                            the leading houses of cities in which Chinese reside will develop the
                            fact that the Chinese use as many and as expensive articles of food and
                            clothing in proportion to their means as the people of any other nation.
                            It is true that a Chinese who makes little will spend but little, in
                            order to prevent the necessity of having to apply to charitable
                            organizations for subsistence. But, after all, a Chinese is not unlike
                            other people in the matter of spending money. It is safe to say that the
                            more he makes the more he spends. I am sorry to say that there are
                            thousands of Chinese in California who have worked hard for years in
                            this country and yet have not been able to save money.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Government does not believe that there would be any great
                            immigration from China to the United States should all restrictions be
                            removed. The principal objection to the exclusion law is that it
                            seriously affects the commercial relations between the two countries.
                            The American people took a prominent part in opening up to the world the
                            immense foreign trade of China. The first American vessel that appeared
                            in Chinese ports was in 1874, and the trade with the United States far
                            outstripped that with any other nation except England until those
                            troubles on the Pacific slope brought about a reaction in China. The
                            Chinese people felt that they had been wronged by having restrictions
                            placed upon them which were not enforced against any other people. I beg
                            to append a table<note n="a" xml:id="d85fnf">Not printed.</note>
                            furnished by the Bureau of Statistics showing the exports from San
                            Francisco to China during the past thirty years, which bears out my
                            statement. (See inclosure No. 6.)</p>
                        <p>The history of this commerce as shown by this table is practically a
                            history of the agitation against the Chinese upon the Pacific coast. In
                            1872, before the agitation, the exports amounted to upward of
                            $7,000,000. The agitation commenced, and in 1876 the exports fell to
                            $126,000. As soon as President Hayes vetoed the first anti-Chinese bill
                            the exports increased to over $9,000,000. Another bill was introduced,
                            and the exports fell to $185,000. The year after the Geary law was
                            passed the exports were $123,000. Owing to the just attitude lately
                            assumed by the United States Government in China, and the rumor that the
                            exclusion law which is about to expire would not be reenacted, a better
                            feeling has prevailed, and the exports have again <pb n="90"
                                xml:id="pg_90" facs="0170"/>increased to over $2,000,000. Had the
                            exports averaged as they did in 1879, they would have been $200,000,000
                            more than they have been from the single port of San Francisco.</p>

                                <p>The more rapid development of the privileges of foreigners in
                                    China and the introduction of modern commercial methods dates
                                    from the treaty of Shimonoseki, made between China and Japan in
                                    1895, at the close of the war between those nations, and
                                    followed by a commercial treaty in 1896. The important features
                                    of these treaties were that they opened the waters of the
                                    principal rivers and canals to citizens of other nations, giving
                                    foreigners the right to purchase goods or produce in the
                                    interior of China, to rent warehouses without the payment of
                                    special taxes or exactions, and to engage freely in all kinds of
                                    manufacturing industries in the treaty ports; also to import all
                                    kinds of machinery, paying only the stipulated import duties
                                    thereon, and upon products manufactured by them in China paying
                                    only such inland transit dues as are leviable on imported
                                    merchandise (the latter provision having been somewhat modified,
                                    however, by the commercial treaty). While the China-Japan treaty
                                    specially conferred these privileges only on Japanese subjects,
                                    they at once became applicable to the subjects of other nations
                                    having full treaty relations with China under the “most favored
                                    nation” principle. The prompt result of this was a movement from
                                    all parts of the business world in the direction of China and
                                    the establishment of business and manufacturing industries not
                                    only in the old treaty ports, but in the new ones which were
                                    opened by the Japanese treaty and by subsequent action of the
                                    Chinese Government. This was followed by other evidences of a
                                    disposition to adopt modern methods. The railroad from Pekin to
                                    Tientsin was quickly completed by the Chinese Government and
                                    agreements made looking to the construction by foreign capital
                                    of other lines thousands of miles in length; telegraphs were
                                    extended; electric roads, electric lights, and telephones
                                    introduced in the principal cities; mining and manufacturing
                                    concessions freely granted; the West River, which penetrates
                                    southern China from Canton westward, was opened to commerce,
                                    and, finally, small steamers under foreign control were given
                                    permission to penetrate to the interior limits of navigation on
                                    all the rivers of the provinces containing treaty ports. The
                                    effect of this is already seen in the establishment of factories
                                    and business houses, the construction of railroads, the
                                    extension and multiplication of steam navigation lines, and the
                                    opening of mines in the great sections where the coal and iron
                                    deposits are said to be the largest in the known world.</p>

                        <p>This is a true description of the progress now in China, and it will be
                            seen that with the statistics showing that the United States was not
                            overrun with Chinese labor before this period of progress, this country
                            could not now be overrun when the demand for labor in China itself has
                            so vastly increased. On account of the exclusion act, the American
                            people are not securing the share they would otherwise have in the
                            profits of this period of Chinese progress. It is natural that China
                            should buy of the country to which it sells. Instead of that, it sells
                            the most to the United States, and although it favors American goods
                            above those of any other country, it largely buys from England. The
                            imports of merchandise from England into China increased from 14,952,000
                            taels in 1878 to 33,960,000 in 1895. Those of the United States
                            increased from 2,253,000 to 5,093,000. The imports from the United
                            States show a falling off from 9,263,000 taels to 5,093,000 the year
                            that the Geary law was put in operation. The exports to the United
                            Kingdom had fallen off from 38,689,000 taels in 1872 to 12,945,000 in
                            1897, while the exports to the United States increased from 11,943,000
                            in 1872 to 17,828,000 in 1897. China continued to sell her goods to the
                            United States, but greatly decreased the proportion of the goods bought
                            from the United States. The reports of the United States consuls
                            officially residing in China are uniform that American goods are
                            preferred, but goods are being purchased from England. The percentage of
                            the exports to China secured by the United States has greatly decreased
                            during this period of <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0171"/>activity in
                            Chinese trade. The total trade of the United States has increased
                            somewhat, but it does not bear as large a proportion as it formerly did.
                            This is a condition which must give concern to both countries, and one
                            which would seem to create the necessity for a commission to examine
                            thoroughly into the entire question of Chinese commerce with the United
                            States and the immigration of the Chinese people.</p>
                        <p>The diplomatic relations between the two countries are, greatly to the
                            satisfaction of the Chinese Empire, most cordial, and afford an unusual
                            opportunity for the Government of the United States to correct the false
                            apprehensions of its people and allay their prejudices, and the Chinese
                            Government to put an end to whatever prejudice may exist upon the part
                            of the Chinese people against the United States. It is the wish of both
                            Governments that these commercial questions should be settled in a
                            manner which will promote the prosperity of both nations and bring about
                            a friendly intercourse between their respective people which will be
                            mutually profitable and gratifying. I think I have shown that the
                            commercial questions are intimately connected with the treatment of the
                            Chinese who seek to enter the United States under the guaranty of
                            treaty, and that the former can not be satisfactorily developed and
                            maintained without a fair and honorable adjustment of the subject of
                            immigration.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="smallcaps">iv.—should the exclusion laws be
                                reenacted, and if so, to what extent of territory should they be
                                applied, and what modifications are called for by experience in
                                their enforcement.</hi></p>
                        <p>The review of the diplomatic history which I have made makes it clear, I
                            think, that the Chinese negotiators of the treaty of 1880 did not
                            contemplate a permanent exclusion of Chinese laborers from the United
                            States, and the American commissioners held out the hope that it would
                            only be a temporary measure and not general in its application. Certain
                            it is that if it had been proposed or intimated that the exclusion would
                            continue for twenty years, the Cainese Government never would have
                            agreed to the treaty. It is also quite certain that if the present laws
                            shall be reenacted, the two Governments can not have the cordial and
                            harmonious intercourse which should be maintained, neither can the
                            commercial relations be as extensive, as intimate, and as profitable as
                            the economic conditions of the two countries demand and justify. Can the
                            Government of the United States afford to pay the high price which it
                            will cost to maintain laws which, I think, I have shown are contrary to
                            the spirit and intent of the treaties, to the recognized principles of
                            jurisprudence, and to the spirit of amity and fair dealing which should
                            control the conduct of nations? I feel confident that if the honorable
                            Congress of the United States will cause a thorough investigation of
                            this important subject to be made, uncontrolled by the unthinking clamor
                            of selfish interests, it will find a better way to conserve the
                            interests of this great country than by the reenactment of the Chinese
                            exclusion laws as they now exist and are enforced.</p>

                        <p>When the American commissioners were in Pekin negotiating the treaty of
                            1880 and asking that power might be conferred upon the Congress of the
                            United States to limit or suspend the immigration of <pb n="92"
                                xml:id="pg_92" facs="0172"/>Chinese, they were asked by the Chinese
                            negotiators if they could “give them any idea of the laws which would be
                            passed to carry such power into execution.” The American commissioners,
                            among other written assurances, said: “If there were sections of the
                            country where such immigration was clearly beneficial, then the
                            legislation of the United States under this power would be adapted to
                            such circumstances. For example, there might be a demand for Chinese
                            labor in the South and a surplus of such labor in California, and
                            Congress might legislate in accordance with these facts. In general the
                            legislation would be in view of and depend upon the circumstances at the
                            moment such legislation became necessary.”</p>
                        <p>Since that carefully worded assurance was given the Hawaiian Islands have
                            been annexed to the United States. It has been the policy of the
                            controlling interests and the practice of the past governments of those
                            islands to admit Chinese subjects into those islands under reasonable
                            conditions. At the time of the annexation there were residing there
                            approximately 20,000 Chinese. The official statistics show that a large
                            number of the Chinese population had been born in the islands, and that
                            a considerable number of them have become lawfully naturalized citizens
                            of Hawaii. They also show that many of them have become holders of real
                            estate; that they outnumber all other nationalities, native or foreign,
                            as merchants and traders, and that in three of the leading branches of
                            trade, as shown by the official licenses issued, they exceed all other
                            nationalities. In social life, also, their position is worthy of
                            consideration, as it will be seen that of the Chinese population over 6
                            years of age 48.47 per cent are able to read and write English or
                            Hawaiian. Of Chinese children over 6 years 92 per cent attend school,
                            and many of them have been educated in the government colleges and
                            higher institutions of instruction. They are prominent in Christian
                            churches and in aiding in the support of hospitals and other charitable
                            institutions. They freely intermarry with the native population. They
                            are recognized as industrious, temperate, and law-abiding and as
                            important factors in various social movements.</p>
                        <p>The reason which brought about the immigration treaty of 1880 between
                            China and the United States, the treaty of 1894, and the legislation
                            based on those treaties which exclude Chinese laborers from the United
                            States does not apply to the Hawaiian Islands. In the States it is
                            alleged that Chinese labor comes in competition with white labor to the
                            detriment of the latter, and that it is contrary to their interests to
                            admit the Chinese; but exactly the reverse is the case in the Hawaiian
                            Islands, as they come into competition with neither white nor native
                            labor, and have been and are regarded there as a desirable element of
                            the population.</p>
                        <p>That such is the case we have the authority of the present government of
                            these islands. The territorial governor in his annual report to the
                            Secretary of the Interior, just made, in speaking of the employment of
                            large numbers of Chinese upon the plantations, says: <quote

                                <p>It may safely be said that such action never has, does not now,
                                    and never will interfere with either American skilled or
                                    unskilled labor. * * * It has been demonstrated beyond a doubt
                                    that the unskilled labor upon the plantations must be furnished
                                    by other than Americans. This would be true even if the large
                                    estates were divided into small holdings. It is simply a
                                    physical impossibility for the Anglo-Saxon satisfactorily to
                                    perform the severe labor required in the sugar fields. This
                                    being true, Hawaii is entitled to legislation favorable to its

                        <p>By the fortunes of war these islands came into the possession of the
                            United States. Previous to that event and for centuries very intimate
                            and important relations had existed between them and China owing to
                            their contiguity and the favorable trade and industrial conditions. The
                            commercial intercourse between the cities of southern China and these
                            islands has been and is now very extensive, and the Chinese population
                            resident there is very large, engaged in every walk of life. There are
                            innumerable artisans, farmers, traders, merchants, bankers, and persons
                            of large wealth—in fact, business men of every legitimate character.
                            Many of these are native born, of which a considerable portion are the
                            offspring of marriage with the Philippine races, and the manners,
                            customs, and characteristics of the people of the islands are so much in
                            harmony with those of the Chinese that the latter for ages have met with
                            a hearty welcome and have fraternized readily with them. During this
                            long period and up to a recent date there have existed free immigration
                            and unrestricted commerce.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the fact that the President of the United States had
                            repeatedly stated that it was not his intention to change the existing
                            conditions in the territory acquired from Spain, further than was
                            necessary to restore and preserve order, and that the whole subject of
                            their future relations would be left to Congress for determination,
                            within a few months after peace was declared the military commander of
                            the Philippines, General Otis, issued an order extending to these
                            islands the Chinese exclusion laws of the United States. By the decree
                            of this officer, without previous authorization of the President or the
                            Secretary of War, and without antecedent notice, this extreme and harsh
                            measure was enforced against the Chinese subjects. And the same still
                            remains in force, notwithstanding the earnest protests and remonstrances
                            of the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>It is respectfully submitted that this measure was, in its inception and
                            now in its continued enforcement, in violation of the principles of
                            international law. When the treaties of 1880 and 1894 were negotiated
                            the Philippine Islands were a part of the dominions of Spain. Those
                            treaties were framed with a view to the peculiar condition of the labor
                            question in the United States, and the Chinese Government reluctantly
                            yielded to the earnest representations of the commissioners of the
                            United States that they were necessary to allay the apprehensions of the
                            white laborers in this country. Only as a matter of comity, and to
                            gratify your Government on that point, did the Chinese Government
                            consent to the treaties. They can not be applied to other territory in
                            another and widely separated part of the globe, where an altogether
                            different condition of labor exists, without the consent of the Chinese
                            Government. To do so would seem to be a breach of good faith as well as
                            of international law, and I feel persuaded that, upon a full
                            consideration of the subject, neither the President nor the <pb n="94"
                                xml:id="pg_94" facs="0174"/>Congress will continue that military
                            order in force by its reenactment in legislation.</p>
                        <p>It is hardly necessary to assert that under no state of circumstances
                            could the Chinese Government have been persuaded to sign a convention
                            which could be interpreted to authorize the exclusion of Chinese
                            subjects from the Philippine Islands, where they had found a welcome and
                            a home, and with which islands as their nearest neighbors its people for
                            centuries had carried on an extensive and profitable commerce. And it is
                            worthy of consideration by the President, who is so justly distinguished
                            for his high standard of right, and by the Congress of a great and
                            enlightened nation, to inquire whether the Chinese, who have lived in
                            and traded with those islands for centuries before the United States had
                            an existence even as colonies of Great Britain, have not acquired vested
                            rights of which they ought not to be deprived even by the legislation of
                            Congress, much less by the mere order of a military commander. Attention
                            is called to the fact that for nearly forty years unrestricted commerce
                            with the Philippine Islands has been guaranteed to the Chinese under the
                            stipulation of article 47 of the treaty of commerce between Spain and
                            the Chinese Government. Under the protection of this treaty a large
                            commerce had been established, and it can hardly be regarded as an act
                            of comity toward China to destroy the commerce built up under the solemn
                            guarantees of the Spanish Government. The order of the military
                            commander, or kindred legislation if enacted, means the destruction or
                            impairment of a large and lucrative trade to and from the seaports of
                            China. It means the cutting off of many thousands and tens of thousands
                            of Chinese and mestizos from their kinsmen in China. It means a radical
                            change in the industries and occupations of these people, and great
                            hardships and impoverishment in many cases. Certainly before an
                            intelligent and right-minded body of legislators shall take such a
                            course they will carefully examine the situation of affairs.</p>
                        <p>What has been the influence of the Chinese in the past centuries and what
                            is it to-day in the Philippines? I must not weary you, as I might, with
                            long citations from recognized authorities in the past and present. I
                            cite only three from many travelers and officials who testify that the
                            Chinese have largely contributed to the prosperity of these islands. Dr.
                            Antonio Morga, in his work on the Philippines, written in the sixteenth
                            century, says of Manila: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>It is true the town can not exist without the Chinese, as they
                                    are workers in all trades and business, and are very
                                    industrious.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Juan de la Concepcion, a writer and traveler in the seventeenth century,
                            sums up the situation as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Without the trade and commerce of the Chinese these dominions
                                    could not have subsisted.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The testimony of writers of the present day might be reproduced in great
                            number, but it will probably suffice to cite the official report of the
                            nearest commercial representative of the United States, Consul-General
                            Wildman, of Hongkong, who was on duty throughout the Spanish war and the
                            subsequent insurrection, and, no doubt, was well informed on the subject
                            of which he wrote. In his report to the Secretary of State of November
                            22, 1898, a short time after the promulgation of the Otis order, he
                            wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Broadly speaking, there is not an industry in the islands
                                    (Philippines) that will not be ruined if Chinese labor is not
                                    permitted.</p>

                        <p>And in a report the following year, speaking of the possibility of
                            competing at Manila with the extensive manufactories at Hongkong, he
                            says it “would only be possible if Chinese labor were admitted freely.”
                            (Consular Reports, November, 1899, p. 421.)</p>
                        <p>The unwisdom of the Otis order is demonstrated by the situation of
                            affairs in the possessions of other nations in the same quarter of the
                            world. The British are reputed to be the most successful in governing
                            colonies, and are usually controlled in their conduct by the best
                            interests of the people over whom they exercise government. In the
                            nearby colony of Hongkong, in the Straits Settlements, and in the Malay
                            Peninsula the British Government welcomes and encourages the immigration
                            of Chinese and admits them to all the rights of citizenship. The result
                            is that Hongkong, Singapore, Penang, and Malakka are in a nourishing
                            condition and peace and contentment prevail. If Congress should, before
                            taking action, send a commission to the Philippines and to the British,
                            French, and other colonies in the Far East, I have no doubt such a
                            report would be made as would lead to the reestablishment of Chinese
                            immigration in the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>Why should the Chinese be excluded from the Philippines, when free
                            entrance is granted to all the other races of the East? While the
                            immigration of the Japanese, the Siamese, the Malay, the Singalese, and
                            the Hindoo coolies is properly permitted, is it a just and fair
                            discrimination to exclude the Chinese?</p>
                        <p>Since the acquisition of the Philippines by the United States it has been
                            correctly stated in this country that their possession would constitute
                            a convenient base of operations for the extension and maintenance of a
                            large commerce between China and the United States. When, by the
                            fortunes of war, these islands were brought into the American union, my
                            Government saw in this proximity an additional reason why the friendly
                            relations which had so long existed between the two nations should
                            become more intimate and harmonious. And it welcomes your efforts with
                            the other great powers to maintain an open door to the commerce of the
                            Chinese Empire. But how can these expectations be realized if the
                            Congress of your country shall ratify the action of the authorities in
                            the Philippines in cutting off access of the Chinese to the islands with
                            which for ages they have maintained intercourse, and in destroying the
                            commerce of important cities with them?</p>
                        <p>From what I have above stated, it will be seen that the treaties of 1880
                            and 1894, which relate to the immigration of Chinese solely to the then
                            existing territory of the United States, do not include the Hawaiian
                            Islands or the Philippine Archipelago within their purview. I am aware
                            that the honorable Congress of the United States has full power to
                            legislate for these newly acquired possessions. Before the enactment of
                            the present exclusion laws, the United States Government deemed it
                            necessary to send a special commission to China to negotiate a
                            convention for the modification of the existing treaties between the two
                            countries, which was concluded in November, 1880. This clearly shows the
                            desirability of consulting the wishes of both Governments in a matter
                            that affects their mutual relations. In view of the vast interests
                            involved and the commercial and friendly relations between China and the
                            United States, I earnestly hope that no hasty step will be taken looking
                            to the reenactment of the exclusion laws, in deference to clamor from
                            any quarter, until every effort has been made to obtain a broad and
                            comprehensive view of the question.</p>

                        <p>It will be seen also from what has been said that the Imperial Government
                            of China does not consider the reenactment of the exclusion laws by the
                            American Congress necessary. But if the honorable Congress should, after
                            proper investigation, still hold to the opinion that the demands of
                            national policy require the retention of some such measure on the
                            statute books, I beg to point out a course which is not open to so many
                            serious objections and which leads to the same results. Why can not the
                            general immigration laws of the United States be so modified and
                            broadened in their scope as to include the immigration of Chinese in
                            their provisions? Why can not the test be made such as to exclude the
                            undesirable elements of all countries from the American shores
                            irrespective of race or nationality? If such a course should be followed
                            it would serve the purpose as effectively as the most drastic law could
                            do. In that case there would be no invidious discrimination so long as
                            the law were made applicable, without distinction, to Europeans,
                            Asiatics, and Africans alike. The most objectionable feature of the
                            present exclusion laws is that they single out the Chinese people alone
                            for unjust exclusion.</p>
                        <p>I regret that the importance of the question and the urgency of the
                            situation have made it necessary that I should ask so much of your
                            valuable time, and that I should dwell at so great a length upon the
                            topic in hand. From what I have said you will have noticed that,
                            appealing to the provisions of Article IV of the treaty of 1880, already
                            cited, I think it proper and incumbent upon Congress, before acting upon
                            the question of new legislation, to examine with care into the hardships
                            suffered by the Chinese subjects, and that this examination can best be
                            made by a commission, who will visit the localities in the United States
                            where the Chinese most largely congregate, and the Hawaiian and
                            Philippine Islands, and by a personal investigation ascertain how the
                            present laws and regulations affect the Chinese and how their exclusion
                            affects the localities in question. I think such an investigation is due
                            from Congress, in view of the treaty stipulations, of the desire of the
                            Imperial Chinese Government, and of the great interests involved. I
                            trust, therefore, that the President of the United States may see proper
                            to send this proposition for a commission to Congress with his favorable
                            recommendation.</p>
                        <p>If such a commission is appointed, I should hope that their report would
                            satisfy Congress that further exclusion of Chinese from the United
                            States is unnecessary; but if that should not occur, it ought to make
                            plain to Congress that the present laws are in violation of justice and
                            humanity, inflict on the Chinese unnecessary hardships and indignities,
                            that they are not in harmony with the treaties, that they work injury to
                            the interests of both countries, and should be materially modified.</p>
                        <p>I entertain the further hope that the investigation will lead to the
                            conclusion that the Hawaiian Islands and the Philippine Archipelago
                            stand on an entirely different footing and should be open to the ingress
                            and egress of Chinese in common with other Asiatics who may resort there
                            for purposes of labor, trade, travel, or residence.</p>
                        <p>I beg to add that I have by no means exhausted the subject. But this
                            paper is already too long, and I feel that I ought not to exhaust your
                            patience. In case, however, the commission should be appointed, as I
                            have suggested, to inquire into the wording of the Chinese exclusion
                            laws I shall be pleased to furnish to the commission further information
                            bearing upon the subject.</p>
                        <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0177"/>
                        <p>In conclusion, I venture to express the belief that the honorable
                            Congress of the United States will deal with the important question at
                            hand in a spirit of fairness and equity and accord to Chinese subjects
                            who wish to come to the United States for all legitimate purposes the
                            same treatment as is accorded to the people of other countries and
                            demanded and secured by this Government for American citizens in
                            China—an open door and a fair field.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to hand you herewith a
                            copy of an inclosure transmitted here in a dispatch from the United
                            States consul at Chefoo (No. 416, May 20, 1901).</p>
                        <p>It shows claims presented by Messrs. Crawford &amp; Hudson, which it
                            appears the governor of Shantung, in the desire to appease the
                            missionaries, has agreed to pay. It seems to me unfortunate that the
                            missionary, owing to his peculiar status, can present and recover
                            damages that an ordinary resident of the country will be precluded from
                            doing under the rules recently adopted by the foreign representatives.
                            (See Mr. Rockhill’s dispatch<note n="a" xml:id="d87fna">See appendix to
                                this volume, page 104.</note> No. 42, March 14, 1901). I have
                            reference to traveling expenses to and from the United States, and extra
                            living expenses while there.</p>
                        <p>Their settlement of the claims of native Christians has caused no end of
                            criticism and ill-feeling, especially in this province, and among
                            foreigners as well as Chinese. They have themselves gone into the
                            country and assessed damages on the various villages where Christians
                                <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0178"/>had been killed or their
                            property destroyed. As they have generally been accompanied by soldiers,
                            such settlements were in fact forcibly made, the presence of the
                            soldiers making them such whether they accompanied the missionaries
                            simply as a guard or not.</p>
                        <p>In Shansi, the governor has set aside 200,000 taels to be fairly divided
                            between the Protestants and Catholics, thus preventing the certain
                            quarrels and strife that will surely follow direct settlements made by
                            the missionaries themselves. So far as I know, this course has been
                            followed in the province of Shansi only.</p>
                        <p>While it might be at times a source of great annoyance and trouble to our
                            consuls and the legation, I think in the end it would prove to the best
                            interests of the missionaries and their work if they were precluded from
                            any official intercourse whatever with the local officials on matters
                            pertaining to their native Christians. A reference to the records of the
                            legation will show that the Chinese Government finds such interference
                            with their people most repugnant, while in some cases unjust treatment
                            or actual persecution of native Christians on the part of petty
                            officials may have been prevented; as a rule, I believe most foreigners
                            who have lived in China for a number of years will agree that it brought
                            down on the Christian all the hatred and animosity this people now seem
                            to be capable of.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            dispatch, No. 640, of May 28 last, reporting that the governor of
                            Shantung, in his desire to appease the missionaries, has agreed to pay a
                            claim presented by Messrs. Crawford &amp; Hudson.</p>
                        <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0179"/>
                        <p>You say: “It seems to me unfortunate that the missionary, owing to his
                            peculiar status, can present and recover damages that an ordinary
                            resident of the country will be precluded from doing, under the rules
                            recently adopted by the foreign representatives. (See Mr. Rockhill’s
                            dispatch, No. 42, March 14, 1901.) I have reference to traveling
                            expenses to and from the United States, and extra living expenses while
                            there;” and you add that the settlement by missionaries of the claims of
                            native Christians has caused no end of criticism and ill-feeling,
                            especially in the province of Chihli, and among foreigners as well as
                            Chinese; and that while it might be at times a source of great annoyance
                            and trouble to our consuls and the legation, you think that in the end
                            it would prove to the best interests of the missionaries and their work
                            if they were precluded from any official intercourse whatever with the
                            local officials on matters pertaining to their native Christians.</p>
                        <p>In reply I have to say that, while unable to apply coercion to American
                            citizens in the provinces to prevent their compromising their claims
                            with the local authorities, this Department has, in its instructions to
                            the consuls, uniformly discouraged independent negotiations between
                            individual sufferers and the district officers for the adjustment of
                            alleged losses, and has enjoined upon the consuls nonintervention to
                            bring about any such piecemeal settlement of difficulties which, so far
                            as this Government is concerned, are being settled in the course of the
                            general negotiations at Pekin.</p>
                        <p>On the 20th of December last an instruction in that sense was sent to the
                            consul at Amoy, which I quote for your information, as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>I have to acknowledge the receipt of your No. 49, of November 7,
                                    1900, reporting that you have adjusted all the claims for
                                    damages to American mission property and have received in
                                    settlement thereof the sum of $3,000, Mexican.</p>
                                <p>The good disposition of the local authorities is appreciated, and
                                    if the settlement effected by you is acceptable to the
                                    sufferers, the Department does not oppose it. Such partial and
                                    scattered settlements can not, however, affect this Government
                                    in dealing with the general question of a settlement with the
                                    Chinese Government which shall secure deterrent and exemplary
                                    punishment and afford guaranties for future safety of our
                                    citizens.</p>
                                <p>The position maintained by this Government is that international
                                    indemnities, especially for Americans murdered, are adjustable
                                    by the Pekin treaty, and that the negotiations can not be
                                    divided by separate local demands. If the local authorities
                                    offer to repair local losses by direct arrangement with
                                    sufferers, officers of this Government are neither to support
                                    nor object to them.</p>
                                <p>You will act accordingly in the future.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>On the 21st of the same month an instruction of similar tenor was sent to
                            the consul at Fuchau.</p>
                        <p>While regarding these separate compositions of claims as unsanctioned and
                            as not involving any responsibility on the part of this Government to
                            effect their execution, the Department must necessarily take equitable
                            cognizance of them as matters of fact, if for no other reason than to
                            bar any duplicate claim upon the international indemnity by reason of
                            the same losses. Hence they should, whenever possible, be reported to
                            the Department, for its information, by the legation or the consuls.</p>
                        <p>You may instruct the consuls in the sense of this instruction.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It becomes my duty to lay before you the
                            claim for damages of several hundred Chinese subjects resident in the
                            city of Butte, Silverbow County, State of Montana, between the year 1886
                            and the present time.</p>
                        <p>These Chinese subjects were peaceable and law-abiding, having complied
                            with all the laws respecting their registry, and were engaged in the
                            lawful business of merchants, keepers of restaurants, farmers and
                            gardeners, laundry men, cooks, servants, and laborers. On or about the
                            year 1886 there was instituted a conspiracy or combination of several
                            thousands of the citizens of the United States, resident in the said
                            Silverbow County, Mont., confederated together in various labor
                            associations, with the object of destroying the business of the Chinese
                            subjects above described, depriving them of their occupations or
                            employment, paralyzing their industry, and by threats and violence
                            compelling them to abandon their homes and business and depart from said
                            city and county.</p>
                        <p>It appears that this conspiracy or combination was at first confined to
                            more or less peaceful methods of what is known as the “boycott,” whereby
                            it was sought to prejudice the inhabitants of the city of Butte against
                            the employment of Chinese subjects and to secure the discharge of those
                            who were already in their employ. But as time passed and the wicked and
                            unlawful object of the conspiracy was proving only partially successful,
                            the conspirators became more bold and lawless in their demonstrations;
                            by false and slanderous stories it was sought to inflame the public mind
                            against the Chinese subjects; it became more difficult for the latter to
                            maintain their lawful pursuits, and the secret murder of a number of
                            Chinese occurred, the perpetration of which must be ascribed to the
                            spirit of lawlessness and hatred created by this conspiracy.</p>
                        <p>The conduct of the conspirators became so violent that the Chinese
                            subjects appealed to the police department of said city and county to
                            protect them from the acts of lawlessness, and to secure to them the
                            protection of their business and to extend to them such rights as by
                            treaty and law were granted to subjects of other nations in said city.
                            But the police did not and would not protect or endeavor to protect
                            them; and so far from securing the protection guaranteed by treaty, the
                            city council, under whose authority the police are appointed and act, in
                            the year 1892, upon the request of the labor associations, indorsed and
                            approved of the conspiracy, and thereby gave its official influence to
                            the unlawful and violent proceedings.</p>
                        <p>This action of the city council increased the opposition to and damages
                            suffered by the Chinese, and in 1893 they appealed through counsel to
                            the governor of the State of Montana to interpose his higher authority
                            and influence to secure to them the protection which had been guaranteed
                            to them by treaty and by public law. The appeal was referred to the
                            attorney-general of the State, who decided that the action of the city
                            council was not unlawful, and in his opinion <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101"
                                facs="0181"/>used such language of hatred and prejudice as I am
                            forced to believe must be unusual in legal documents of the United
                            States. No relief or interposition was obtained from the governor of the
                            State, and the conspirators, assured of the sympathy of the local
                            authorities, redoubled their lawless proceedings greatly to the damage
                            of the business and pursuits of the Chinese subjects.</p>
                        <p>Finally, all other relief being closed to them by the inaction and lack
                            of sympathy on the part of the authorities, these Chinese subjects, to
                            the number of more than 200, through their counsel, applied in 1897 to
                            the judge of the circuit court of the United States, petitioning that
                            certain of the conspirators named should be brought into court to answer
                            for their conduct, which was set forth in detail, and that the judge
                            would take such action as he should find necessary and possible for the
                            relief of the petitioners. Thereupon, the judge caused a full
                            investigation to be made, and as a result thereof he directed a decree
                            to be issued commanding and enjoining the conspirators named and all
                            their confederates and coconspirators from further continuing or
                            conspiring to injure or destroy the business of the Chinese subjects and
                            to cease from all acts tending to maintain the conspiracy and
                            boycott.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I desire to direct your attention to the following
                            facts which were judicially determined by the United States court in
                            said suit: That the Chinese subjects who were parties to the suit in
                            court, to the number of over 200, were then (1897) and had been for
                            eight years previous peacefully domiciled in Silverbow County conducting
                            or desiring to conduct lawful business, and that they were entitled to
                            the protection of the United States; that the defendants in the suit and
                            certain other persons, residents of said county, to the number of more
                            than 3,000, representing more than twenty unions or associations, banded
                            together to organize and carry into execution “a willful and malicious
                            conspiracy and combination” to deprive the Chinese residents “of the
                            means of earning a livelihood, and thereby compel them to leave the said
                            county;” that in execution of this conspiracy and combination an
                            executive committee was appointed for the vigorous prosecution of the
                            same, with power to raise money and employ men “to be a working force to
                            commit the acts” of violence to be hereafter stated; that large sums of
                            money were raised by forced subscriptions among business men and from
                            the unions, and that a considerable force of men was so hired; that
                            notices were published in the newspapers and posted throughout the city,
                            and especially on the places of business of the Chinese subjects and on
                            the houses of all persons employing Chinese, announcing that a boycott
                            of the Chinese had been declared, and appealing to all citizens to
                            cooperate in carrying it out; that they employed and caused a wagon to
                            be driven through the city carrying a large transparency on which was
                            painted repulsive caricatures of Chinese subjects, with a display notice
                            of the boycott, and a gong sounding to attract attention; that the
                            members of the conspiracy did willfully and maliciously go in numbers to
                            the places of business of the Chinese merchants, stand upon and forcibly
                            occupy the highway and sidewalks, and warn people about to become
                            customers that these places were boycotted—that persons ought not to and
                            must not patronize such places; that these conspirators did sometimes
                            use force and compel the customers to leave such places of business, and
                            that the result of such violent acts was to materially reduce the
                            business of such <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0182"/>merchants and
                            make the same unprofitable; that in further execution of said conspiracy
                            and combination the hotels and boarding houses of the city in which were
                            employed Chinese cooks or servants were visited and notified that the
                            Chinese servants must be discharged; persons were hired to willfully and
                            maliciously go to such houses, stand upon and forcibly occupy the
                            highway and sidewalk, and warn and threaten such persons as were about
                            to enter that they must not patronize such houses; that a number of such
                            boarding houses were kept by females; that when they declined to obey
                            the orders of the conspirators, a wagon, with a transparency containing
                            the name of the boarding house and the proprietress boycotted, was
                            driven about the city with a gong sounding; that in almost all cases the
                            women were forced to yield to the demand and discharge their Chinese
                            servants, but in addition they were compelled to pay to the conspirators
                            the money expended for the wagon and advertising, amounting in the case
                            of one female to $45; that persons were employed by the conspirators to
                            ascertain all the private and business houses in which Chinese were
                            employed, and they were treated in a similar manner; that a boycott was
                            placed upon the Silver Bow National Bank because its cashier employed a
                            Chinese servant and its place of business was in a block in which a
                            Chinese acted as janitor; the bank began to suffer by the withdrawal of
                            depositors, and the boycott was only removed after a secret conference
                            between its president and a committee of the conspirators; and that the
                            effect of the acts of the conspirators, a part of which are above
                            described, was to deprive many of the Chinese residents of work and the
                            means of earning a livelihood, to materially reduce the business of the
                            merchants and make the same unprofitable, and to break up the homes and
                            drive away from Silverbow County 350 of such Chinese residents, being
                            one-half of the number of those residing in said county, and that all of
                            the Chinese residents would have been driven away but for the
                            restraining influence of the injunction of the United States circuit
                            court.</p>
                        <p>It is to be borne in mind that all these acts, growing out of what the
                            court finds to be a “willful and malicious conspiracy,” were committed
                            openly, with the full knowledge of the police, the city and the State
                            authorities, and without a single effort on their part to restrain the
                            lawlessness, as will be seen by reference to the finding No. 27 of the
                            record of said court.</p>
                        <p>The petitioners whose claim for indemnity I herewith submit estimate the
                            damages suffered to amount to $500,000. They recognize the good effect
                            of the injunction of the United States court, but represent that the
                            conspirators, while ceasing from open acts of violence, are still
                            seeking to execute their conspiracy by clandestine means. It further
                            appears that the persons who have inflicted the damages are insolvent,
                            even if it were possible to successfully accuse them before the courts,
                            which in the present state of local public sentiment would be
                            impossible. Neither can any remedy be found by proceedings against the
                            city or county authorities who have willfully allowed these damages to
                            be inflicted.</p>
                        <p>The only remedy to be found for my injured countrymen is to resort to the
                            Government of the United States to make good its treaty stipulations. I
                            therefore appeal to you, and through you to the honored and upright
                            President, to take such steps as will fully indemnify the Chinese
                            subjects of Silver Bow County, Mont., for the pecuniary losses and
                            injuries they have sustained, and such as will hereafter <pb n="103"
                                xml:id="pg_103" facs="0183"/>secure to them the full enjoyment of
                            their rights as peaceful and law-abiding residents.</p>
                        <p>I transmit herewith the petition of the Chinese subjects setting forth
                            their grievances and losses, and to this are attached the complaint
                            before the United States circuit court, the action of the city council
                            of Butte City and the governor of the State of Montana, the findings of
                            facts, and the injunction of the United States court.</p>

                                the district of Montana, restraining and enjoining the defendants

                                and Silver Bow County. Among the findings is one to the effect that

                                County and Butte City, Mont., and some of whom, to the number of

                                respectfully petition your excellency to take such action and
                                institute such proceedings as will result in securing to your
                                petitioners pecuniary compensation for the wrongs and injuries

                            <p>And your petitioners represent that they are persons of Chinese
                                descent and natives and subjects of the Empire of China, who during
                                the period above mentioned were domiciled in said Silver Bow County,
                                State of Montana, and in all respects were complying with the laws
                                of the United States, authorizing and permitting them to remain as
                                denizens of the said United States and entitling them to all the
                                rights and privileges of citizens of the most-favored nations; and
                                they were conducting divers and sundry industries in said county and
                                State to the great advantage of said community and profit to
                                themselves.</p>
                            <p>And your petitioners say that while they were engaged in the
                                peaceable and orderly conduct of their divers and several industries
                                as aforesaid certain citizens of the <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104"
                                    facs="0184"/>United States, resident in said Butte City, did
                                wickedly and maliciously conspire against your petitioners and their
                                fellow-countrymen, denizens as aforesaid, with the intent and for
                                the purpose of destroying all their industries and preventing them
                                from securing any reward for the labors in which they were engaged,
                                and to compel them to leave the said city, county, and State.</p>
                            <p>That such conspirators, numbering several thousand citizens of the
                                United States, having been organized into unions or associations,
                                successfully and secretly did institute against all the Chinese
                                subjects in said Silver Bow County, including your petitioners, a
                                boycott, by means whereof they designed and intended to prevent your
                                petitioners and their countrymen, in said Silver Bow County, from
                                conducting any business whatever, whereby they would be deprived of
                                a livelihood and would be compelled to emigrate to some other
                                country; and your petitioners say that many of them were without
                                means and were dependent upon their daily labor for the necessaries
                                of life.</p>
                            <p>That when said unions or associations had been formed as aforesaid
                                and had entered upon said boycott they proceeded to inflame the
                                minds of people of other races than ours against your petitioners
                                and their countrymen and to excite animosity against them by libels,
                                slanders, abuse, and all the processes of mischief which they could
                                set in motion; that to this end they assumed to forbid any citizen
                                of the United States or person other than of Chinese descent from
                                patronizing your petitioners or their countrymen or any of them
                                therein or from employing them in any industry whatever, and to this
                                end did threaten our customers with a like boycott in case they
                                should disregard the commands of said conspirators. To the end that
                                they might be protected against such unlawful actions, your
                                petitioners and other Chinese subjects resident thereat applied to
                                the police department of said city and county, which is charged by
                                law with the protection of individual rights and the maintenance of
                                public order, to prevent the said boycott so far as it assumed the
                                form of lawlessness and to secure to your petitioners such rights as
                                by treaty and law were granted to subjects of other nations in said
                                county and State.</p>
                            <p>But the police did not and would not so protect or endeavor to
                                protect your petitioners, and so it was that the said unions and
                                associations, being the conspirators aforesaid, by a resolution
                                adopted by them, requested the council of the said city of Butte, in
                                which your petitioners did most dwell, to assist them in their
                                unlawful practices so as aforesaid contemplated and set in motion,
                                and said city council, which is the legislative department of the
                                said city of Butte, did indorse and approve said movement, and by
                                its actions consented to assist and did assist the conspirators
                                aforesaid in their design and purpose so as above manifested, and
                                failing therein, after long-continued endeavor, your petitioners
                                applied to the officers of the said county, charged by law with the
                                maintenance of public order, and asked them to assist your
                                petitioners in protecting their said rights, but so it was that the
                                said officers did neglect and refuse so to do.</p>
                            <p>That thereupon your petitioners, or some of them, called the
                                attention of the authorities of the State of Montana, to wit, the
                                governor thereof, to the conspiracy and boycott aforesaid, with the
                                statement that the same was in derogation of the treaty rights of
                                your petitioners, and requesting protection therefrom, but so it was
                                that the said governor, referring the said statement and request to
                                the attorney-general of the State as to his opinion thereon, said
                                attorney-general did maintain that the said conspiracy and boycott,
                                and consequently pecuniary damage, were not in derogation of the
                                rights of your petitioners, and thereupon, being so advised as to
                                his duty, the chief executive of the State, charged by her
                                constitution to see that the laws were faithfully executed,
                                neglected to protect your petitioners against the actions of the
                                conspirators aforesaid.</p>
                            <p>And your petitioners do further represent that said conspiracy and
                                boycott existed long prior to 1886, and does since exist, to the
                                great damage of your petitioners and those they represent, and their
                                countrymen, natives, and subjects of the Chinese Empire, and chat it
                                does yet continue, to the great and continuing damage of all Chinese
                                whose domicile is in said Silver Bow County.</p>
                            <p>And the passions and prejudices of the more ignorant citizens of the
                                said community are and have been so excited as that the Chinese have
                                been deprived of the means of making a living and in a number of
                                instances native Chinese subjects have been killed by the citizens
                                of the United States in consequence of the conspiracy aforesaid.</p>
                            <p>And your petitioners do further say that they have been damaged by
                                reason of unlawful acts so as aforesaid committed in being, deprived
                                of their labor and business as aforesaid in the sum of $500,000 and
                                more, and that large numbers of their countrymen, subjects and
                                natives of the Empire of China, whose domicile was in said <pb
                                    n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0185"/>Butte at the time of the
                                commencement of said boycott, were by reason thereof driven from
                                said city and county and compelled to seek a living elsewhere, to
                                their great pecuniary injury, loss, and damage.</p>
                            <p>And your petitioners say that, having been subjected to the injury
                                and contumely aforesaid and the loss and damage consequent thereon,
                                they commenced a certain action in the circuit court of the United
                                States to enjoin and prevent the said unlawful acts of the said
                                conspirators, and that with expense and labor they did finally
                                procure an injunction whereby the unlawful and coarser forms of said
                                conspirators were enjoined and restrained, but the same still
                                clandestinely continues to the great injury of your petitioners.</p>
                            <p>Your petitioners attach hereto and mark as “Exhibit A” their bill of
                                complaint in the action aforesaid, which in form and substance they
                                affirm is true. They also attach the order whereby certain other
                                Chinese subjects, residents in Silver Bow County, were admitted as
                                complainants in said action.</p>

                                repressing the same.</p>
                            <p>They also attach hereto and mark as Exhibit C the findings of the
                                examiner in chancery, appointed for that purpose by said court, of

                            <p>They also attach hereto and mark as Exhibit D the findings of the

                            <p>They also attach hereto and mark as Exhibit E the order of the court
                                for a “permanent injunction in said case.</p>

                                taken before said examiner.</p>
                            <p>And your petitioners say that during the continuance of said boycott
                                they suffered great damage in their estate and persons and that the
                                defendants in said action as well as the other persons joining in
                                said conspiracy against whom proof could be obtained were then
                                citizens of the United States, owing to it allegiance, obedience,
                                and fidelity, and are and were practically insolvent, and that for
                                the loss and damage by your petitioners suffered there is no remedy
                                at law or otherwise than through diplomatic channels.</p>
                            <p>Your petitioners do further say that they are ready at all times and

                                done to the Empire of China by said citizens of the United States to
                                their persons and estate, including the homicides aforesaid, your

                                country adequate remuneration, and it may be recommended that His
                                Imperial Majesty may direct that the same be paid to us, that we may

                                these violations of the treaty obligations of the United States of
                                America. And as in duty bound your petitioners will ever pray.</p>

                            <p>And your orators say that, so being subjects of the Chinese Empire
                                domiciled as aliens of the United States and residing in said
                                Silverbow County, on or about the 1st day of April, 1896, the said
                                Hum Fay, Deer Yick, and Hum Tong, as they well might, pursuant to
                                the privileges so secured to them by treaty and law, at Butte, in
                                said Silverbow County, did proceed to carry on the business of
                                buying and selling for a profit Chinese and Japanese goods and of
                                keeping a restaurant for customers for profit at No. 37 West Park
                                street, in the city of Butte aforesaid, in the county of Silverbow,
                                which said business they were able to conduct for a period of time
                                without let or hindrance from the said defendants or any of them,
                                and at great profits to your said orators aforesaid. But so it was,
                                as your said orators are informed and verily believe, that the said
                                defendants, with the intent and for the purpose of preventing the
                                said Hum Fay, Deer Yick, and Hum Tong from conducting the said
                                business successfully and from securing any custom or customers
                                therefor, and from making any profit thereat, and with the intent
                                and for the purpose of intimidating the patrons of the said owners
                                of said restaurant in their said business, and thereby preventing
                                them from patronizing said business and to break up the business of
                                the owners of said store and restaurant, and compel them to leave
                                the said county of Silverbow, did, on or about the 1st day of
                                October, 1896, willfully and maliciously combine, confederate, and
                                conspire together, and with other persons in large numbers to your
                                orators unknown, and to the number of three or four hundred, all
                                actuated by a like purpose, designed to deprive all Chinese aliens
                                residents at said county of Silverbow of the privilege of doing
                                business therein and of the equal protection of the laws and of
                                equal privileges and immunities under the laws, and to deny them the
                                rights and privileges secured to them by the laws and treaties of
                                the United States.</p>
                            <p>And your orators do further say that the said Hure Pock, on the 1st
                                day of April, 1896, and from that time forward until now, has
                                conducted in the said city of Butte a store for the sale of Chinese
                                and Japanese goods at great profit to himself, and has proceeded to
                                carry on, and does yet carry on, said business; and your orators do
                                further say that a large number of the alien Chinese above mentioned
                                are engaged in the conduct of divers and sundry kinds of business in
                                said Butte, to wit, the keeping of restaurants and providing food
                                for individuals who should desire to eat thereat for a compensation
                                to be paid by such customers, and divers and sundry of them carrying
                                on the business of raising garden vegetables in said Silverbow
                                County, and sundry and divers of such Chinese aliens as mentioned
                                herein are engaged in the laundry business for profit, and were
                                making large profits in and about the conduct of the various kinds
                                of business so by them carried on as aforesaid in the said county of
                                Silverbow.</p>
                            <p>And your orators do further say that there is a large number of
                                Chinese alien residents of said Silverbow County who could and but
                                for the wrongs hereinafter set forth and described would conduct and
                                carry on divers and sundry enterprises and business in said county
                                of Silverbow at a great profit to themselves; but so it is that the
                                said defendants, their aiders, abettors, confederates, and
                                conspirators, wickedly designing and intending to disregard the laws
                                and treaties of the United States and the laws of the State of
                                Montana, and to deny these Chinese aliens, residents aforesaid, the
                                equal protection of the laws and equal privileges and immunities
                                thereunder, and to break up the business in which they are engaged,
                                and to deny to them the privileges of profitably conducting the
                                same, and to prevent others of said alien Chinese residents from
                                entering into that or any other business in said county of Silverbow
                                for that purpose and with that intent, on or about the 1st day of
                                October, 1896, did combine, conspire, and confederate together, and
                                with divers and sundry other persons to your orators unknown,
                                willfully and maliciously to deprive your orators and other Chinese
                                alien residents of said Silverbow County of their rights so to
                                conduct said business profitably, and, having so wickedly combined,
                                conspired, and confederated together for that purpose, did, on the
                                1st day of October, 1896, at said Butte, maliciously and with force
                                and arms go into the place of business of the said Hum Fay, Deer
                                Yick, and Hum Tong, and did stand upon and occupy the highway in
                                front thereof and the sidewalk thereat, and did there remain upon
                                said walk and public way warning all persons who had patronized and
                                were customers of the said Hum Fay, Deer Yick, and Hum Tong, or who
                                were about to become their customers in and about their business
                                aforesaid and for whom they were made, and but for the unlawful and
                                malicious conspiracy and acts aforesaid would have made large sums
                                of money, and did, in behalf of the various voluntary organizations
                                herein described and named, advise, direct, and state to said
                                persons that the said business and place of business aforesaid of
                                the said owners was placed under a boycott, and that persons and
                                customers aforesaid contemplating becoming <pb n="108"
                                    xml:id="pg_108" facs="0188"/>customers and all persons ought not
                                and should not and must not patronize the said business of the
                                owners of said store and restaurant as aforesaid.</p>
                            <p>And your orators do further say that the said defendants, their
                                aiders, abettors, and confederates as aforesaid, did then combine
                                and conspire together, and did follow other customers of your
                                orators with the malicious intent to deprive your orators of the
                                right to the profitable business in said Silver Bow County, and
                                warned and directed them not to patronize alien Chinese in any
                                manner whatever, and did threaten customers of your orators and
                                other alien Chinese, as aforesaid, that if they should continue to
                                patronize such alien Chinese the said combination, confederation,
                                and conspiracy will place such patrons under a boycott and thereby
                                deprive them of the rights and privileges which they are entitled to
                                enjoy under the laws; and thereby many of the customers of your
                                orators and the other Chinese alien residents engaged in business in
                                the said county of Silver Bow are terrified and prevented from
                                patronizing your orators. And to the end that the said defendants,
                                their aiders and abettors, may more efficiently and effectually
                                destroy the business of your orators and the alien Chinese
                                aforesaid, they have heretofore organized and are now maintaining
                                divers and sundry combinations, confederations, and associations,
                                known as assemblies, unions, brotherhoods, or some other names to
                                your orators unknown, and said assemblies, brotherhoods, and unions,
                                or other associations, have willfully and maliciously combined,
                                conspired, and confederated together to continue and to perpetrate
                                the wrongs aforesaid to your orators and other Chinese alien
                                residents of Silver Bow County, and to destroy their business and to
                                prevent them from engaging in legitimate business in said county,
                                and from the privileges of earning a living and money as the result
                                of their labors as aforesaid. And among the organizations so by said
                                defendants, their aiders, abettors, and coconspirators organized and
                                conducted there are the Workingman’s Union, the Carpenters’ Union,
                                the Plumbers and Gas Fitters’ Union, the Tailors’ Union, the

                                the welfare and interest of the various members thereof by lawful
                                means aforesaid, by their members perverted into the combination and
                                conspiracy aforesaid, whereby the business of your orators has been
                                impaired, and if such combination shall succeed, this will be
                                entirely destroyed.</p>
                            <p>And your orators do further say that the said defendants, their

                                other material advertising that the Chinese of said county be
                                boycotted and recommending that nobody shall patronize them, and
                                warning all persons not to become customers of them, and which
                                contain, among other things, pictures and cartoons of Chinese of a
                                character and quality calculated and designed to hold all Chinese
                                alien residents up to contempt and to excite the prejudice of the

                                alien Chinese residents, and of preventing others of like descent
                                and nativity and nationality from entering upon said business,
                                procure the same to be carried or drawn in wagons through the
                                streets of the said city of Butte, to the end that the prejudice of
                                the individuals composing that community may be excited, and that
                                the ignorant or the wicked, if any such there shall be, shall by
                                force and arms and otherwise destroy the business of your orators
                                and the aliens of Chinese descent and nationality, and your orators

                                ascertain who said customers are, to the end that such custom may be
                                destroyed, and to warn such customers not to patronize your orators
                                or their countrymen engaged in business thereat.</p>

                                they did maliciously and unlawfully contribute money to spies and
                                pay informers so as aforesaid engaged in perverting persons from
                                patronizing your orators in and about their business and in carrying

                                pictures, paintings, mottoes, and signs printed as aforesaid, which
                                are malicious defamations of your orators and all who are Chinese

                                without being subject to the conspiracies aforesaid, and wholly
                                unrestrained, except by equal, just, and impartial laws. And your

                                associations, assemblies, unions, brotherhoods, by delegates from
                                each of said voluntary associations, have organized a trade and
                                labor assembly, which said trade and labor assembly, in its own name
                                and in the name of the foregoing organizations, is continuing to
                                boycott, persecute, and harass, as aforesaid.</p>

                                the said defendants, your orators would be permitted to enjoy their
                                natural, essential, and inalienable rights, among which is the right
                                of enjoying their liberty of acquiring possession and protecting
                                their property, and seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness
                                by the peaceful and untrammeled conduct of the lawful business in
                                which they are engaged. And your orators do further say that there
                                are in the said county of Silver Bow a large number of Chinese
                                persons, alien residents therein, subjects of the Empire of China,
                                engaged in the business of buying and selling merchandise thereat
                                for a profit, and of keeping restaurants for profit, and are engaged
                                in the business of making and selling clothing and raising garden
                                vegetables for a profit, and other lawful occupations. But the
                                combinations and conspiracies of the said defendants and others
                                aforesaid is designed and intended by the said defendants and others
                                to prevent your orators, and all others who are subjects and aliens
                                of the Empire of China, from conducting their said business
                                legitimately within the limits of said county of Silver Bow, and to
                                intimidate and coerce the citizens of said county from patronizing
                                your orators and the other natives and subjects of the Empire of
                                China aforesaid, and they have succeeded in destroying most of the
                                patronage heretofore enjoyed by your orators and the Chinese
                                subjects aforementioned.</p>
                            <p>And your orators do further say that from the very nature of the
                                damage and injury so as aforesaid perpetrated and incurred it is not
                                possible to prove the amount thereof in an action at law, and that
                                the recovery of such damages as are consequent <pb n="110"
                                    xml:id="pg_110" facs="0190"/>thereon would involve a
                                multiplicity of suits, and that if the said defendants and the other
                                citizens combining and confederating with them shall be permitted to
                                continue their unlawful and malicious acts aforesaid the injuries to
                                your orators and the other natives and subjects of China residing in
                                Silver Bow County will be irreparable, and that there is no adequate
                                remedy at law for the redress of the wrongs so suffered.</p>
                            <p>And your orators do further say that the said defendants, their
                                aiders, and abettors as aforesaid, are daily engaged in preventing
                                by the unlawful means aforesaid, customers from patronizing the
                                stores, restaurants, tailor shops, laundries, and ether places of
                                business of your orators and the other Chinese residents aforesaid,
                                conducted by the natives and subjects of China in the said county of
                                Silver Bow, arid are daily causing your orators and other natives of
                                China aforesaid to suffer great loss in and about their business in
                                said county conducted.</p>
                            <p>And your orators do further say that the said defendants by reason of
                                their identification with said divers and sundry organizations have
                                great power and influence over the community in which your orators
                                and their countrymen have been doing business, and are able thereby
                                to incite the wicked and ignorant in said community to continue the
                                perpetration of said wrongs to your orators and others, and that
                                they intend so to incite the ignorant and wicked members of said
                                community to continue their boycott so wickedly and unlawfully
                                incited, inaugurated, and maintained, and to impair and render
                                unprofitable the business in which your orators and others are now
                                and have for the last ten months been engaged.</p>
                            <p>And your orators further say that the said defendants did from time
                                to time themselves secretly meet and with their aiders and abettors
                                advise and plan a continuation of the unlawful acts aforesaid by
                                them or some of them, and they threaten so to continue to do.</p>
                            <p>And your orators do further say that the foregoing boycott and acts
                                constituting the same are perpetrated by the said defendants and
                                others wickedly, unlawfully, and maliciously in scorn of the public
                                faith of the United States, which by treaty and law is so solemnly
                                pledged to protect your orators and all other alien Chinese
                                residents of the United States from the maltreatment hereinbefore
                                alleged and described.</p>
                            <p>And your orators do further say that damages accruing to your orators
                                by the said wrongs heretofore perpetrated by the said defendants
                                exceeds the sum of $50,000, and unless restrained by the court the
                                further injury hereafter to be perpetrated by a continuance of the
                                said wrongs above set forth and threatened will exceed the sum of
                                $2,000, and that the good will of their business so being conducted
                                at Butte, in said county, would, by the cessation of said wrongs so
                                threatened and being perpetrated, be increased more than $2,000.</p>
                            <p>And your orators do further say that all of the foregoing acts and
                                doings are contrary to equity and good conscience and tend to the

                                        the undersigned were appointed a committee to wait upon your
                                        honorable body and to ask the assistance of the city
                                        government in labor’s strenuous endeavors to rid the city of
                                        the Chinese.</p>
                                    <p>“For years, owing to the competition of the Chinese, a
                                        respectable living in any classes of labor in this city has
                                        been uncertain and precarious. Our laboring men can not live
                                        as cheaply as Chinamen, and therefore can not afford to work
                                        in competition with Chinamen. Considering it the duty of the
                                        city government to look after the welfare of its citizens,
                                        we are confident that the present city government, like its
                                        predecessors, will regard the interests of the white men,
                                        who are citizens, rather than the Chinamen, who are not
                                        citizens.</p>
                                    <p>“The method in which we ask the city council to second our
                                        efforts to rid the city of the Chinamen is by discharging
                                        all the city employees who employ Chinese help directly or
                                        indirectly, or who in any way patronize Chinese labor.</p>

                            <p>The first of these documents appears to be a communication which was
                                prepared by a committee of the Silver Bow Trades and Labor Assembly
                                of Butte, Mont., under the authority and direction of such Trades
                                and Labor Assembly, and presented to the mayor and city council in
                                the month of December, 1892, which communication was referred to the
                                judiciary committee of said council, and thereafter the report of
                                said committee being received by the council the same was

                            <p>This matter so submitted to us presents for our consideration two
                                propositions, the first of which is international and the second a
                                State question and involving the violations of the stipulations or
                                obligations of a treaty, and second the enforcement of the laws of

                                <item>First. Is the action of the city council of the city of Butte
                                    in contravention of any law of Congress or of any treaty
                                    stipulation or obligation of the United States Government with
                                    that of China, and the subjects thereof residing and being

                                <item>Second. Does this case present such a state of facts to your
                                    excellency, if true, as will warrant executive interference in
                                    the absence of any complaint on the part of the subjects of the
                                    Chinese Government who are residing within the jurisdiction of
                                    the State of Montana, or a demand for an inquiry by the
                                    Department of State of the General Government?</item>

                            <p>The first treaty of any note that was entered into between the
                                General Government and China was one of peace, amity, and commerce
                                between the United States of America and Ta Tsing Empire of China,
                                concluded at Wang Hiya on July 3, 1844, and ratified by the
                                President January 17, 1845.</p>
                            <p>One of the conditions of said treaty was to the effect “that there
                                shall be a perfect, permanent, and universal peace and a sincere and
                                cordial amity between the United States of America on one part and
                                the Ta Tsing Empire on the other part and between their people
                                respectively without exception of person or places.”</p>
                            <p>The object of said treaty was to open to the citizens of the United
                                States five Chinese ports and permit the citizens of the United
                                States to proceed at their pleasure with their vessels and
                                merchandise to and from any foreign port to either of said five
                                ports, and from either of said five ports to any other of them. At
                                each of said five ports citizens of the United States lawfully
                                engaged in commerce were permitted to import from their own or any
                                other port in China and sell there and purchase therein, and export
                                to their own or any other ports therein, all manner of merchandise
                                of which the importation or exportation was not prohibited by said
                                treaty. The former limitations of trade of foreign nations to
                                certain persons appointed at Canton by the Government and commonly
                                called Hong merchants was thereby abolished, and citizens of the
                                United States engaged in the purchase or sale of imports or exports
                                were by the article of said treaty admitted to trade with any and
                                all subjects of China without distinction, and were not to be
                                subject to any new limitations or impeded in their business by
                                monopolies or other injurious restrictions.</p>
                            <p>At the place of entry of the vessels of the United States the
                                citizens of the United States, merchants, seamen, or others
                                sojourning there might pass and repass in the immediate
                                neighborhood, but they could not at their pleasure make excursions
                                into the country among the villages at large, nor could they repair
                                to their public marts for the purpose of disposing of goods
                                unlawfully and in fraud of the revenue.</p>
                            <p>All citizens of the United States in China peaceably attending to
                                their affairs were placed on a common footing of amity and goodwill
                                with subjects of China, and were entitled to receive and enjoy for
                                themselves and everything appertaining to them the special
                                protection of the local authorities of Government who were required
                                to defend them from all insult or injury of any sort on the part of
                                the Chinese.</p>
                            <p>If the citizens of the United States had special occasion to address
                                any communication to the Chinese local officers or Government, they
                                were required to submit the same to their consul or other officer to
                                determine if the language was proper and respectful and the matter
                                just and right, in which event the consul would transmit the same to
                                the appropriate authority for their consideration and action in the
                                premises, and if the controversy should arise between citizens of
                                the United States and subjects of China which could not be amicably
                                settled otherwise the same should be examined and decided
                                conformably to justice and equity by the public officers of the two
                                nations acting in conjunction.</p>
                            <p>It was stipulated that the provisions of said treaty should not be
                                altered without grave cause; but inasmuch as the circumstances of
                                the several ports of China open to foreign commerce are different,
                                experience may show that inconsiderable modifications are requisite
                                in those parts which relate to commerce and navigation, in which
                                case the two Governments will, at the expiration of twelve years
                                from the date of said convention, treat amicably concerning the same
                                by means of suitable persons appointed to conduct such
                                negotiations.</p>
                            <p>In 1858, which was nearly thirteen years after the ratification of
                                the first treaty with China and during the administration of
                                President Buchanan, the two Governments adopted and renewed in a
                                manner clear and positive by means of a treaty or general convention
                                of peace, amity, and commerce, the rules which in future were to be
                                mutually observed in the intercourse of their respective
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>This treaty was substituted for the treaty of 1844, so far as it
                                related to the identical subjects, and had effect of opening
                                additional ports to commerce and permitted citizens of the United
                                States with their families to trade therein and to proceed at their
                                pleasure with their vessels and merchandise from any of said ports
                                to any other of them.</p>
                            <p>Prior to the adoption of this last-named treaty the vessels of the
                                United States have not been admitted to trade freely with the ports
                                of China on an equal footing with the vessels of other countries;
                                but this treaty had the effect to open to the United States all the
                                ports of China which were at that time open to foreign commerce.</p>
                            <p>Following the rule laid down in article 34 of the treaty of 1844,
                                which provided that additional articles might be made thereto every
                                twelve years, the United States and the Ta Tsing Empire entered into
                                articles additional to the treaty of 1858, which <pb n="114"
                                    xml:id="pg_114" facs="0194"/>were ratified by the President in
                                1868, and which was known as the Burlingame treaty.</p>
                            <p>In the last-named treaty the Emperor of China was delegated with the
                                right to appoint consuls at ports of the United States who should
                                enjoy the same privileges and immunities as those which were enjoyed
                                by public law and treaty in the United States by the consuls of
                                Great Britain and Russia, or either of them.</p>
                            <p>This treaty by its articles recognized the inherent and inalienable
                                right of man to change his home and allegiance, and also the mutual
                                advantage of the free migration and immigration of citizens,
                                respectively, from the one country to the other for the purposes of
                                curiosity, of trade, or as permanent residents. It provided that
                                citizens of the United States visiting or residing in China should
                                enjoy the same privileges, immunities, or exemptions in respect of
                                travel or residence as may there be enjoyed by the citizens or
                                subjects of the most favored nation, and reciprocally Chinese
                                subjects visiting or residing in the United States shall enjoy the
                                same privileges, immunities, or exemptions in respect to travel or
                                residence as may there be enjoyed by the citizens or subjects of the
                                most favored nation, and reciprocally Chinese subjects visiting or
                                residing in the United States shall enjoy the same privileges,
                                immunities, and exemption in respect to travel or residence as may
                                there be enjoyed by the subjects or citizens of the most favored
                                nation; but nothing therein contained should be held to confer
                                naturalization upon citizens of the United States in China nor upon
                                subjects of China in the United States.</p>
                            <p>It is further provided that Chinese subjects should enjoy all the
                                privileges of educational institutions under the control of the
                                Government of the United States which are enjoyed in the respective
                                countries by the citizens or subjects of the most favored nations;
                                and that Chinese subjects may freely establish and maintain schools
                                within the United States at those places where foreigners are by
                                treaty permitted to reside.</p>
                            <p>Under the provisions of the treaty of 1868, as well as those of
                                former treaties, hordes of Chinese laborers, who were subjects of
                                the Ta Tsing Government, took advantage of the plenary conditions
                                and literally poured into the United States, and not until protest
                                after protest had gone up from the people against this influx of
                                immigration which endangered the good order of certain localities
                                within its boundaries—namely, the Pacific coast States and
                                Territories—did the Government of the United States, by its
                                Congress, take legislative action thereon, and on May 6, 1892,
                                passed what was called the Chinese exclusion act. The act provided
                                that the coming of the Chinese laborers to the United States be, and
                                the same is hereby, suspended after the passage of the act and until
                                the expiration of ten years next thereafter.</p>
                            <p>Said act further provided that hereafter no State court or court of
                                the United States shall admit Chinese to citizenship. This act was
                                intended to prevent and did have the force and effect of preventing
                                Chinese laborers from immigrating into the United States, and for
                                its constitutionality depended upon the fact that it was a police
                                regulation in this that the coming of Chinese laborers to this
                                country endangered the good order of certain localities within the
                                territory thereof. While this act exempted from its provisions all
                                the Chinese laborers who were in the United States on the 17th day
                                of November, 1880, as well as those who came to the same before the
                                expiration of ninety days after the passage of said act, it was in
                                itself, so far as the United States could speak through that body, a
                                Congressional declaration that the subjects of Ta Tsing Empire and
                                the Chinese are objectionable to the people of the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>The people of the United States spoke through their Congress, which
                                was their sovereign power, and declared in plain and unmistakable
                                language “that Chinese cheap labor, which had taken or obtained so
                                firm a root in American soil, should be uprooted and transplanted
                                into the soil of its nativity.” It was a declaration that the
                                fittest should survive, and a further declaration that their
                                presence in this country was prejudicial to and endangered the good
                                order of certain localities within the territory thereof.</p>
                            <p>The act of Congress of 1882, and as amended by the act of 1884, was
                                accepted, and must be understood as a proscription against the
                                admission of Chinese subjects into the United States by land or
                                water, and any Chinese person found unlawfully within the United
                                States shall be caused to be removed therefrom to the country from
                                whence he came at the cost of the United States, after being brought
                                before some justice, judge, or commissioner of a court of the United
                                States and found to be not lawfully entitled to be or remain in the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>The first step that was taken to protect free white labor against
                                competition against Chinese cooly labor and discourage the
                                immigration of Chinese into the United States was taken by the
                                miners in the State of California in the years 1854 and 1855, and
                                resulted in the passage of a law which fixed the rate of a foreign
                                miner’s tax at <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0195"/>$4 a month
                                as to all foreigners “eligible to become citizens of the United
                                States/’ and as to all foreigners “ineligible to become citizens of
                                the United States,” increased it $2 a month for every successive
                                year ad infinitum.</p>
                            <p>The agitation of this question which was so vital to the people
                                continued, and their opposition thereto was made manifest by further
                                legislation by the legislature of California, in 1858, by an act
                                entitled “An act to prevent the further immigration of Chinese or
                                Mongolians into this State.”</p>
                            <p>The subject-matter of this act is noted in the two sections
                                following:</p>
                            <p>“On and after the first day of October, A. D. one thousand eight
                                hundred and fifty-eight, any person or persons of Chinese or
                                Mongolian races shall not be permitted to enter this State, or the
                                land therein, or at any port thereof, and it shall be unlawful for
                                any man or person, whether captain or commander or other person in
                                charge of or interested in or employed on board of, or passenger
                                upon, any vessel of any nature or description whatsoever, to
                                knowingly allow or permit any Chinese or Mongolian on and after such
                                time to enter any of the ports of this State, or land therein or at
                                any place or places within the borders of this State; and any person
                                or persons violating any of the provisions of this act shall be held
                                and deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof
                                shall be subject to a fine in any sum not less than four hundred
                                dollars nor more than six hundred dollars for each and every
                                offence, or imprisonment in the county jail of the county in which
                                the said offense was committed for a period of not less than three
                                months nor more than one year, or by both such fine and
                                imprisonment. Section 2. The landing of each and every Chinese or
                                Mongolian person or persons shall be deemed and held as a distinct
                                and separate offence, and punished accordingly.”</p>
                            <p>The legislature of California, influenced and urged on by the
                                continued opposition of Americans to Chinese cooly labor, in 1862
                                passed an act entitled “An act to protect free white labor against
                                competition and discourage the immigration of Chinese into the State
                                of California.”</p>
                            <p>As early as 1848 the States of New York and Massachusetts, by and
                                through their legislatures, enacted laws imposing a direct tax upon
                                alien passengers, the former $1 on cabin and $1.50 on steerage
                                passengers, and the latter a tax of $2 on each passenger, to be paid
                                under both laws by the master, owner, or consignee of the ships.</p>
                            <p>Upon the ground that the power of tolerance or intolerance of
                                foreigners is a question which should lie with the Federal
                                Government, and act with the State governments, the courts held the
                                tax unconstitutional, although Chief Justice Taney, in a case
                                arising under the statute of New York, dissented from a majority of
                                the court and contended that the power over persons was in the State
                                and not in the Federal Government.</p>
                            <p>The advocates of the several measures disavowed the doctrine of State
                                sovereignty, but asserted the States as independent in the
                                management of their internal affairs; that in everything which
                                contributed to their tranquility they are the managers; that in all
                                police regulations they are supreme; that the State had an
                                inalienable right to regulate all matters pertaining to its public
                                morals, must have the right to exclude paupers, criminals, and
                                dangerous persons, and that the exercise of this power and
                                discretion rested nowhere else than in the legislature. (Prigg <hi

                            <p>Unquestionably the power exists in the State absolutely to decide
                                what is sufficient cause to forbid a continued residence within its
                                borders, and those considerations may be municipal or economical—as
                                for example, danger of pauperism, danger of health, danger to
                                morals, danger to property, danger to public principles by
                                revolutions and change of government, or danger to religion.

                                regulations which are not inconsistent with the constitution and
                                laws of the State to protect such municipality from dangers of

                                        of the word; they will not even permit their bones to have

                                        Butte, would not interfere with the “possession or
                                        enjoyment” of property by the Chinese or prevent them from
                                        engaging in common with American citizens resident
                                        therein.</item>

                                        China and the subjects thereof residing and being within the
                                        United States under said treaty.</item>

                            <p>That these two propositions are not mooted must be conceded. From the
                                very fact that the customs and habits of the Chinese are such as
                                negative the assumption that they are bona fide residents of this
                                State and too that the laws of Montana permit foreigners to engage
                                in trade upon an equal footing with the citizens thereof; and that
                                this can not be regarded in any sense as an inhibition upon the
                                right of the Chinese to engage in trade.</p>
                            <p>The treaties that have been entered into from time to time between
                                the United States of America and Ta Tsing Empire show nothing more
                                than that they were intended for the purpose of trade and commerce
                                between the two countries and for maintaining permanent and
                                universal peace between the people of those Governments
                                respectively.</p>
                            <p>We present a brief epitome of the several articles of treaty:</p>
                            <p>The treaty of 1844 provided for the opening of five ports and
                                permitted citizens of the United States with their families to
                                reside and trade there. It provided that the United States might
                                appoint consuls at these ports and restricted the trade to these
                                places. Citizens of the United States were allowed to engage pilots
                                for their vessels in entering said ports and to hire servants and
                                clerks, seamen, and laborers; that no cargo could be discharged
                                without permits from the superintendent of customs of the port. The
                                tonnage duty on vessels belonging to the United States was required
                                on their being permitted to enter. Duties on imports were required
                                to be paid on the discharge of the goods and duties of export on the
                                landing of the same, payable either in sycee silver or in foreign
                                money at the rate of exchange as ascertained by the regulations then
                                in force.</p>
                            <p>It provides how houses and places of business may be obtained, the
                                hiring of sites for the inhabitants to construct houses and places
                                of business, and also hospitals, churches, and cemeteries, and that
                                the local authorities of the two Governments should select in
                                concert the sites for the foregoing objects. The citizens of the
                                United States were not permitted at their pleasure to make
                                excursions into the country among the villages at large nor to
                                repair to public marts for the purpose of disposing of their goods.
                                In case any officer or citizen of the United States employed any
                                citizen of China such employee was protected from prosecution on the
                                part of the Chinese Government. It provides for the protection of
                                dwellings or property when attacked by mobs, incendiaries, or other
                                lawless persons.</p>
                            <p>In case of controversies arising between citizens of the United
                                States and subjects of China, the same are to be examined and
                                decided conformably to justice and equity by the public officers of
                                the two nations acting in conjunction.</p>
                            <p>It provided that if merchant vessels of the United States were
                                plundered by robbers or pirates in Chinese waters and the robbers
                                could not be apprehended by reason of territory and numerous
                                population of China, that the Chinese would not make indemnity for
                                the goods lost.</p>
                            <p>It provided for the action on the part of the Chinese Government in
                                case of vessels wrecked or stranded on the coast of China.</p>
                            <p>It provided for the mode and manner of correspondence not only in
                                case where citizens of the United States desired to address the
                                local officers of China, but in case of correspondence between the
                                authorities or representatives of the respective Governments, and
                                prohibited the interchange of presents between the two
                                Governments.</p>
                            <p>It prohibited the citizens of the United States trading with any
                                other ports of China that were not open to foreign commerce, and
                                that in case of such violation they were not entitled to any
                                countenance or protection from the United States. It negatived any
                                construction of the treaty that would confer naturalization upon
                                citizens of the United States in China, or upon subjects of China in
                                the United States. The so-called Burlingame treaty is the only
                                treaty in existence which purports to grant to subjects of the Ta
                                Tsing Empire residing in the United States rights, privileges, and
                                immunities coequal to those granted to the citizens of the United
                                States residents of such Empire.</p>
                            <p>As to those privileges, the treaty provides that Chinese subjects
                                visiting or residing in the United States shall enjoy the same
                                privileges, immunities, and exemptions in respect of travel or
                                residence as may there be enjoyed by the citizens or subjects of the
                                most favored nation.</p>
                            <p>This latter paragraph does not, as will be perceived, grant to
                                subjects of the Chinese Empire residing in the United States the
                                right to engage in trade and deal in lands and estates, and the
                                holding of any office therein is practically inhibited by
                                proscription of the rights of naturalization.</p>
                            <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0197"/>
                            <p>To asseverate that citizens of the United States under the articles
                                of either treaty have the right to freely engage in trade in any
                                portion of the Ta Tsing Empire, except such as are specifically
                                enumerated in said articles, would be to contend for that which is
                                not therein written. All that is not therein delegated is excluded
                                therefrom for that such treaties are limitations of right rather
                                than a delegation of prerogative. They carry with them the stamp of
                                autocratic concessions on the one hand and monarchial reservations
                                on the other.</p>
                            <p>That which was secured by American diplomacy has yielded us an
                                inheritance of Mongolian vampirism, which has fastened itself upon
                                every source of living common to American wage workers.</p>
                            <p>Because we think to remove this human barnacle by lawful and
                                legitimate measure, we are met with the declaration that “such
                                peaceful agencies are in violation of the said treaty
                                obligation.”</p>
                            <p>These treaties of peace, amity, and commerce never contemplated that
                                we should yield up to the subjects of the Chinese Empire every
                                channel and means by which the American wage worker secures a
                                livelihood for himself and family in order that his wealth might go
                                to the former or that they might compete with him to the extent that
                                the exercise of such privileges would be prejudicial to and endanger
                                the good order of any locality within the United States.</p>
                            <p>This is not a retrospect of facts, dependent upon speculation or idle
                                fancy, but a state of facts the existence of which is the nursery of
                                crime and the parent of poverty. How best to preserve the rights of
                                the wage workers of the country after their destruction through
                                Mongolian labor is not the inquiry, but how to preserve them from
                                such destruction.</p>
                            <p>In view of the above facts and the articles of said mentioned
                                treaties we hold that the action of the city council of Butte was
                                not in any manner or at all in conflict with the treaty obligations
                                of the United States Government with that of China.</p>

                                under said order and appeared and were heard orally and submitted

                                dropping a rat into a pot containing soup; that these cartoons were
                                designed to, and would, excite in the spectators feelings of

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your note No. 207, of July 6
                            last, presenting the claims of several hundred Chinese subjects resident
                            in the city of Butte, Silverbow County, Mont., for $500,000 damages for
                            injuries received by them at the hands of lawless parties in said city
                            and county between the year 1886 and the date of your note, I have the
                            honor to inform you that the Department has given careful consideration
                            to your note and its inclosure.</p>
                        <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0208"/>
                        <p>It is clearly shown that the rights of the Chinese subjects mentioned
                            were violated by the boycott placed upon them by various labor
                            organizations of the city of Butte, and it is equally obvious that for
                            the redress of their grievance an adequate remedy was and is afforded by
                            the courts. The proof of these facts is found in the findings and decree
                            of the Federal court enjoining the defendants from the commission of the
                            acts complained of.</p>
                        <p>While it is stated in your note that the conspirators are still seeking
                            to execute their conspiracy by clandestine means; that the persons who
                            inflicted the damages are insolvent, and that no remedy can be found by
                            proceedings against the city or county authorities, yet neither of these
                            allegations seems to the Department to warrant the exercise of
                            diplomatic intervention.</p>
                        <p>The damages suffered could have been averted by a prompt appeal to the
                            court; and the facts that the complainants have suffered damages through
                            their laches in making the appeal does not justify a departure from the
                            ordinary rule that diplomatic intervention is improper in any case where
                            ample judicial remedies exist. If the complainants had promptly availed
                            themselves of their remedial rights, the injuries complained of could
                            have been prevented. Their failure and neglect to do so does not make
                            the United States culpable and responsible for the damages
                            resulting.</p>
                        <p>The statement that the conspirators are still seeking to execute their
                            conspiracy by clandestine means is one which, to justify action, should
                            be sustained by proofs, on the submission of which to the court it is
                            not doubted that the penalties for disobeying the injunction will be
                            applied.</p>
                        <p>The statement that no remedy could be found against the unlawful action
                            of the city or county authorities in aid of the conspirators, the
                            Department is unable to accept as correct in point of law.</p>
                        <p>The Department is glad to be able to assure you that while the action of
                            the Federal court is sufficient proof that the rights of the subjects of
                            the Empire of China domiciled in the city of Butte will be protected and
                            enforced by the judiciary, it may yet add that the Executive will not
                            fail, should the case arise justifying its interposition, to use all its
                            power to secure to them all the rights, privileges, immunities, and
                            exemptions guaranteed by the United States Constitution and by treaty
                            between the Governments of the United States and China.</p>
                        <p>Accept, etc.,</p>

                                me your advice in the following case:</p>
                            <p>Lam Chung Wa, a resident of Canton, has called on me at the consulate
                                and preferred a request to be registered here as an American
                                citizen. He was a resident of the Hawaiian Islands for seventeen
                                years, prior to that Territory becoming our property. His papers
                                show that he was a naturalized Hawaiian subject. He left Hawaii in
                                1897 for Canton, where immediately after his arrival he engaged in
                                business as a merchant. He is still a merchant and in good standing.
                                I inclose for your courteous perusal and decision all of his
                                original papers and his photograph.</p>
                            <p>I have told Lam Chung Wa that I will refer his case to you for
                                decision. I hope that I am not giving you too much trouble.</p>

                                dispatch No. 357, of the 22d ultimo, transmitting Consul McWade’s
                                dispatch No. 193, of the 16th ultimo, requesting instructions upon
                                the citizenship of one Lam Chung Wa.</p>
                            <p>It appears from the evidence submitted that the said Lam Chung Wa is
                                a native of Heong Sang, in the province of Kuangtung, Empire of
                                China; that on the 19th day of August, 1886, he was naturalized as a
                                citizen of the Kingdom of Hawaii before W. M. Gibson, minister of
                                the interior; that he was recognized as such naturalized citizen by
                                passport No. 1454, issued to him September 1, 1890, by the acting
                                consul-general of Hawaii at Hongkong, and again by a special
                                certificate issued to him by H. E. Conger, minister of foreign
                                affairs of Hawaii, on November 22, 1897.</p>
                            <p>The act of Congress of April 30, 1900, entitled “An act to provide a
                                government for the Territory of Hawaii,” provides as follows:</p>
                            <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Sec</hi>. 4. That all persons who were citizens
                                of the Republic of Hawaii on August 12, 1898, are hereby declared to
                                be citizens of the United States and citizens of the Territory of
                                Hawaii.”</p>
                            <p>By virtue of the above Lam Chung Wa is a citizen of the United
                                States, unless he has renounced such citizenship.</p>
                            <p>In this connection I call your attention to the statement in Mr.
                                McWade’s dispatch that Lam Chung Wa left Hawaii in 1897 for Canton,
                                where immediately after his arrival he engaged in business as a
                                merchant, and where he is still a merchant in good standing.</p>
                            <p>A citizen of the United States “may reside abroad for purposes of
                                health, education, amusement, or business for an indefinite period,
                                and may even acquire a civil or commercial domicile there, without
                                expatriation, providing he does so with the intention in good faith
                                of returning to the United States. But if he permanently withdraws
                                himself and his property and places both where neither can be made
                                to contribute to the national necessities, acquires a political
                                domicile in a foreign country and avows his purpose not to return,
                                he has placed himself in the position where his country has the
                                right to presume that he has made his election of expatriation.”</p>
                            <p>This presumption arises more readily “when a naturalized citizen of
                                the United States returns to his native country and resides there
                                for a series of years with no <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132"
                                    facs="0212"/>apparent purpose of returning.” By some of our
                                naturalization treaties a residence of two years in the country of
                                nativity without the intention of returning being in some way made
                                apparent, is sufficient to give rise to the presumption of
                                self-expatriation.</p>
                            <p>I beg to suggest that Consul McWade be advised to exercise great care
                                before registering Lam Chung Wa as a citizen of the United States,
                                that “his claim to American citizenship shall not be made the
                                pretext of avoiding duties to one country while absence secures him
                                from duties to another.”</p>

                                advice about it, and whom to apply to if you are not the right
                                party, and about what the expenses will be. I intend to make a visit
                                to Denmark in the near future and would not like to go through the
                                Danish army for the pleasure of visiting my native country one or
                                two months. If any reference is necessary in regard to this matter,
                                please write William Rob. Anderson, register of deeds, Albert Lea,
                                Minn. I was born in Wejen Lendum Sogn, Jyland, July 27, 1868.</p>

                                I beg to say that your naturalization as a citizen of the United
                                States has released you from your former allegiance to Denmark, and

                                as a citizen of the United States.</p>
                            <p>Having emigrated to America at the age of 21, and having acquired
                                full citizenship there, you are not liable to military service on

                            <p>I would advise you to bring with you your certificate of
                                naturalization, and to procure a passport either from the Department
                                of State at Washington or, on your arrival, from the legation of the

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I would request you to enlighten me on
                                the following question: I emigrated to America at the age of 21
                                years 6 months. I resided in the United States seven years, and
                                acquired American citizenship by naturalization. When I returned to
                                Denmark three years ago I met at the conscription session, and on
                                exhibiting my certificate of naturalization, I was informed that if
                                I was in the country two years from that time I was to present
                                myself again at that place. I returned to America, however, before
                                the expiration of the two years, remaining there about one year.</p>
                            <p>On my return here two weeks ago I was notified to appear at the
                                conscription session, where I was enlisted for military service. No
                                notice was taken of my citizenship papers. Can I be required to
                                perform military duty? If so, why was I not pressed into the service
                                three years ago. I attained my thirty-second year in August this
                                year. I desire to be informed, at your earliest convenience, if the
                                authorities have a right to require me to meet for duty immediately
                                after my return here, when I am an American citizen. Had I been
                                conscripted three years ago, and then left the country, the case
                                would have been different.</p>
                            <p>Note the fact that I am 32 years of age and have resided in America
                                as stated above.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully, yours,</p>

                                excellency’s attention to the following military-service case:</p>
                            <p>Sören L. Sörensen, who emigrated from Denmark to the United States at
                                the age of 21 (he is now 32), was duly naturalized as an American
                                citizen in 1895. In 1897 he visited his native country, returning to
                                the United States after a stay of less than two years. About the
                                middle of last September, he again returned to Denmark, and he has
                                recently been notified that his name has been entered on the
                                conscription rolls for military duty. His present address is
                                Bramminge, Jutland. No military service had been required of him
                                before his emigration, and he secured the usual permit before
                                leaving the country. He appears to be here on a matter of business,
                                which he wishes to arrange so as to be enabled to return to the
                                United States. He appeals to me for intervention in his behalf; and

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: In a note, dated October 1,
                                1900, you have been good enough to invite my attention to the case
                                of Sören Laurids Sörensen, who, though a naturalized citizen of the
                                United States, has been entered upon the conscription rolls of
                                Denmark, the country of his birth, where he is making a short
                                sojourn for the purpose of arranging certain business matters.</p>
                            <p>After having corresponded with my colleague, the minister of justice,
                                I have the honor to inform you as follows regarding the case of the
                                person in question: The above-named Sören Laurids Sörensen, who was
                                born in Denmark in 1868, and who at the age of 17 was entered on the
                                conscription rolls, emigrated in 1890, after having notified the
                                proper authorities as required. His name was not, however, stricken
                                from the rolls. In May, 1897, he returned to Denmark, and in July of
                                that year he purchased a piece of property at Nöraa, in the commune
                                of Bramminge, which, in the month of March, 1898, he exchanged for
                                property situated in the village of Bramminge, thus for a second
                                time becoming a proprietor. He remained in Denmark until the month
                                of September, 1899; that is to say, more than two years. In
                                September, 1899, he entered upon his second journey to the United
                                States; not, however, with the intention of remaining; but for the
                                purpose of selling a piece of property which he owned there.</p>
                            <p>Finally, on his return to Denmark in September, last year, he was
                                summoned for military duty.</p>
                            <p>The above-named Sörensen having been domiciled in Denmark more than
                                two years, having become a proprietor, and having made his living
                                both as agriculturist and as keeper of a temperance hotel, my
                                colleague, the minister of justice, considers his summons to
                                military service entirely legitimate, in accordance with Article III
                                of the convention concluded between Denmark and the United States
                                July 20, 1872.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my letter of January 25,
                                last, I now inform you that the minister of justice has decided your
                                case.</p>
                            <p>After a careful investigation he has come to the conclusion that you
                                are liable to military duty in Denmark. From a note addressed to me
                                by the Danish minister of foreign affairs I learn the following
                                facts regarding your case:</p>
                            <p>You were born in Denmark in 1868. At the age of 17 you were entered
                                on the conscription rolls. In 1890 you emigrated to America, after
                                having notified the proper authorities, as required. Your name was
                                not, however, stricken from the military rolls. In May, 1897, you
                                returned to Denmark, and in July of that year you purchased a piece
                                of property at Nöraa, in the commune of Bramminge, which, in the
                                month of March, 1898, you exchanged for property situated in the
                                village of Bramminge, thus for a second time becoming a
                                proprietor.</p>
                            <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0219"/>
                            <p>You remained in Denmark until the month of September, 1899; that is
                                to say, more than two years. In September, 1899, you entered upon
                                your second journey to the United States; not, however, with the
                                intention of remaining, but for the purpose of selling a piece of
                                property which you owned there. Finally, on your return to Denmark,
                                in September, last year, you were summoned for military duty.</p>
                            <p>The above facts establish a strong presumption that you have
                                withdrawn not only your person, but also your interests, from the
                                United States, and, on their face, show absence of intent to return
                                for the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship
                                there.</p>
                            <p>You appear to have returned to the country of your original
                                allegiance to secure a permanent livelihood there. Unless you
                                furnish strong and satisfactory proof in rebuttal of the contention
                                made by the minister of justice, namely, that you have taken up your
                                permanent domicile in Denmark without intent to return to the United
                                States, I have no authority to intercede with the Danish Government
                                in your behalf.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully, yours,</p>

                            neglects to do so he maybe fined from 2 to 40 kroner; but if his neglect
                            arises from a design to evade service he may be imprisoned.</p>
                        <p>In case he fails to appear when the law requires that he be assigned to

                            provides that a former subject of Denmark naturalized in the United

                            United States; but he is not thereby exempted from penalties for
                            offenses committed against Danish law before his emigration. If he
                            renews his residence in Denmark with intent to remain, he is held to
                            have renounced his American citizenship.</p>

                            emigration he was in the army and deserted, or, being 22 years old at
                            least, had been enrolled for duty and notified to report and failed to

                                at some future date for legitimate purposes, they would experience

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: You can say to Rev. John Lee, in answer to
                            his questions, copies of which you inclose me in your No. 168 of April
                            10, 1901, as follows: <list>
                                <item>First. The Ecuadorean Congress did pass the civil registry
                                    bill for the registry of marriages, births, and deaths. It was
                                    approved by the President October 25, 1900.</item>
                                <item>Second. The same Congress did pass a law forbidding priests or
                                    monks to teach in any school under Government control, except as
                                    appointed to teach religion; said law also prohibits any school
                                    under <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0225"/>the control of
                                    the priests or monks from conferring any degree except
                                    ecclesiastical. This law was approved by the President October
                                    18, 1900.</item>
                                <item>Third. Information desired as to “more liberal laws,” etc.,
                                    October 5, 1900, the President approved a law passed by Congress
                                    to buy (compulsory sale of church required) the cemeteries of
                                    the country, so anyone could be buried in them.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>A representative of the Pope has just left Ecuador.</p>
                        <p>While here he and the minister of foreign affairs negotiated a treaty
                            between church and state granting civil marriage for non-Catholics, and
                            a division of all cemeteries, so that in one part may be buried
                            non-Catholics and in the other Catholics. This is to save the Government
                            the expense of buying the cemeteries.</p>
                        <p>This treaty must be approved by Congress of Ecuador and the Pope before
                            it becomes operative.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: By order of my
                            Government I have the honor to send you herewith a copy of a memorial by
                            which Messrs. Marty &amp; D’Abbadie, French citizens and shipowners at
                            Haiphong (Tonkin), represent how they have been injured by certain
                            decisions made concerning them by the American authorities in the
                            Philippines.</p>
                        <p>This claim, as you will see, arises from the fact that the Federal
                            authorities at Manila believe themselves authorized to compel vessels
                            that touch at ports in the Philippines to leave the whole of their
                            cargoes there, even though it may be impossible to sell them.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, the steamer <hi rend="italic">Sullberg</hi>, chartered by
                            Messrs. Marty &amp; D’Abbadie, found it impossible owing to events then
                            transpiring at Iloilo to carry to that port merchandise that were booked
                            for it, and for seventeen days the head of the customs service at Manila
                            refused to allow the said vessel to sail for Asia with that merchandise.
                            For all the losses sustained in consequence of the detention of their
                            vessel our fellow-countrymen claim an indemnity of 22,471 Mexican
                            dollars.</p>
                        <p>In the opinion of my Government the pretension of the American
                            authorities at Manila seems contrary to the rules followed in all
                            merchant countries. Indeed, the principle which is constantly observed
                            in all policed States is that the master of a merchant vessel laden with
                            merchandise is permitted to discharge in the port for which it is bound,
                            or at which it may put in, such part only of the cargo as he may
                            designate for the purpose either of his own motion or under the orders
                            of his employers. Moreover, only that part of the merchandise so
                            designated that is entered for consumption is subject to customs duties,
                            and not such as may be warehoused in bond or manifested for transit.</p>
                        <p>The pretension to which Messrs. Marty &amp; D’Abbadie object is so
                            clearly contrary to the prevalent usages that it seems to rest on the
                            personal decision of a customs official and not on any formal provision
                            of the new customs regulations of the Philippines to which it seems that
                            General Otis would not have failed to refer in a precise manner if the
                            possibility of such a reference had occurred to him.</p>
                        <p>I can but commend this claim to your kindly attention and embrace this
                            opportunity to renew, etc.</p>

                                the said partnership having been entered into in pursuance of an
                                instrument under private seal dated September 11, 1886, and extended
                                by an instrument, likewise under private seal, January 1, 1897,
                                until December 31, 1906, shipowners, residing at Haiphong, Tonkin,
                                have the honor to address to the United States Government the
                                present reclamation, the object of which is to secure an indemnity
                                of 22,471 piasters,<note n="a" xml:id="d121fna">French persons in

                                    to the American dollar. The dictionary of the French Academy
                                    (sixth edition) says that the piastre is a silver coin whose
                                    value is about 5 francs. Its value, however, differs in
                                    different countries.</note> by way of redress for the injury
                                done them by the arbitrary detention of the steamer <hi

                                board in the waters of Manila, from February 13 to March 2,

                            <p>This indemnity would be payable to the firm of Marty &amp; D’Abbadie,
                                charterers of the <hi rend="italic">Sullberg</hi>, by way of redress
                                for the losses occasioned to them by paying for the use of the
                                vessel during her detention and by the expenses caused by the acts
                                of the American authorities, and also for the losses experienced on
                                the cargo and on the freight that would have been earned by the
                                vessel during the time of her detention.</p>
                            <p>The owner of the vessel, Mr. H. N. Struve, Hauptstrasse C. 63,
                                Blankenese, Germany, agent at Hongkong for Messrs. Siemssen &amp;
                                Co., is not interested in the present claim, the amount of the
                                freight agreed upon in his favor having been duly paid.</p>
                            <p>No claim has been, and none can be, brought by any person whatever on
                                the ground of the acts that have given rise to the present claim for
                                indemnity. There is no reason for paying any attention to the
                                insurers of the goods, since the present petition has reference only
                                to the damage caused by the detention of the vessel during a period
                                of seventeen days. In support of this claim the claimants have the
                                honor to furnish the following detailed information:</p>
                            <p>The steamer <hi rend="italic">Sullberg</hi>, carrying the German
                                flag, Mr. H. N. Struve, of Hauptstrasse C. 63, Blankenese, Germany,
                                being the owner, and Messrs. Siemssen &amp; Co. being the agents at
                                Hongkong, and the vessel having been chartered by Messrs. Marty
                                &amp; D’Abbadie, French shipowners, residing at Haiphong, Tonkin,
                                left Quinhone, Anam, on the 9th of February last, with a cargo of
                                rice and salt belonging to the charterers.</p>
                            <p>The rice was to go to Manila, while the salt was to be taken to
                                Iloilo.</p>
                            <p>At the time of its departure from Quinhone there was nothing that
                                could cause the charterers to suppose that the vessel could not make
                                the proposed voyage and land successively at Manila and at Iloilo
                                the goods which were intended for those ports.</p>
                            <p>The steamer arrived at Manila on the 14th day of February, and
                                effected the discharge of its cargo of rice with great difficulty.
                                The difficulties were such that the grain could not be warehoused
                                before the 28th of February. Consequently the rice remained in the
                                lighters for thirteen days, and during its stay the quantity of 94
                                piculs and 74/100 was removed (i. e., stolen).</p>
                            <p>As soon as the vessel arrived the captain of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Sullbery</hi> learned that, in consequence of the hostilities
                                between the United States Government and the Philippine insurgents,
                                the city of Iloilo had, in a great measure, been burned, and that
                                any commercial transaction there was impossible. He was therefore
                                compelled to renounce entering that port.</p>
                            <p>The captain then decided that he would leave Manila after discharging
                                the rice (evidently thinking that the discharge would be effected
                                within the normal period of from twelve to eighteen hours), in order
                                to go to Hongkong, where he hoped to be able to negotiate, in due
                                time, the sale of the 18,000 piculs of salt remaining on board of
                                his vessel. Contrary to all expectation, however, not only did the
                                American authorities create all possible difficulties in order to
                                prevent the landing of the rice, but they objected to the departure
                                of the <hi rend="italic">Sullberg</hi>, and, furthermore, claimed
                                that the captain must be compelled to discharge his salt at Manila.
                                Feeling confident that the right was on his side, the captain
                                refused to do this.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding his energetic protest and the intervention of the
                                General Tobacco Company (which was the consignee of the vessel) and
                                of the consul of France, the American authorities maintained their
                                opposition.</p>
                            <p>This state of things continued until the 2d of March, when the
                                American authorities decided to remove the interdiction and to
                                authorize the departure of the vessel.</p>
                            <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0229"/>
                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Sullberg</hi> had been detained at Manila from
                                February 13 to March 2—that is to say, for seventeen days.</p>
                            <p>Was this detention legal? Was it in conformity with the rules of
                                international law? Can it at least be explained by the necessities
                                of the conflict between the United States Government and the
                                Philippine insurgents? Evidently not.</p>
                            <p>In the first place, and even if a state of war were recognized
                                between the Philippine insurgents on the one hand and the United
                                States Government on the other, and even if the latter consequently
                                invoked belligerent rights in its favor, the fact is that no
                                proclamation of a blockade had been issued as regarded the coasts of
                                Manila. And no blockade could be established there, as Manila is now
                                under the de facto sovereignty of the American Government.</p>
                            <p>The entrance into and departure from the port of Manila had
                                necessarily therefore to remain free to all vessels carrying a
                                neutral flag.</p>
                            <p>No special notice had been given to the captain of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Sullberg</hi>, and when he entered the port of
                                Manila he had a right to suppose that he could trade there, freely,
                                as usual.</p>
                            <p>Even if a state of war had been proclaimed and a regular blockade had
                                been established subsequently to the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Sullberg’s</hi> entrance into the port of Manila, that vessel
                                would have had a perfect right, recognized by all powers, to depart
                                free with her cargo, and a certain time should have been allowed to
                                her for that purpose.</p>
                            <p>Thus, even admitting that a state of war existed, the detention of
                                the <hi rend="italic">Sullberg</hi> in the manner in which it took
                                place was absolutely at variance with the rules of international
                                law.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, there was nothing to justify it.</p>
                            <p>Will it be said that the <hi rend="italic">Sullberg</hi> was
                                suspected of having arms or munitions for the rebels on board? The
                                    <hi rend="italic">Sullberg</hi> had sailed from Anam direct to
                                Manila, which port is now under the high authority of the United
                                States Government. This circumstance was in itself sufficient to
                                show that there was no intention to commit fraud or to introduce
                                articles contraband of war.</p>
                            <p>If the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Sullberg</hi> had had arms
                                for the rebels, he evidently would not have gone to Manila to
                                discharge them.</p>
                            <p>The ship’s papers were, moreover, in proper order; the manifest,
                                which had been viséd by the French authorities on her departure from
                                Quinhone, mentioned nothing but a cargo of rice and salt, and it is
                                a principle received in international law that a ship’s papers which
                                have been regularly viséd by the authorities of one power are
                                entitled to full faith and credit among the other powers.</p>
                            <p>Finally, even supposing that the American authorities had any reason
                                to suspect a fraud on the part of the captain of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Sullberg</hi>, they had no right to detain that
                                vessel for seventeen days in the waters of Manila.</p>
                            <p>If the United States Government invoked the rights of belligerent
                                powers, it could not exercise, on board of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Sullberg</hi>, anything more than a mere right of search, and
                                it could not hold the vessel any longer than was necessary to make
                                that search.</p>
                            <p>In no case can the right of search imply the right to require the
                                discharge of the goods.</p>
                            <p>These are well-founded principles, and the law of nations establishes
                                a right to indemnity when a search has shown the suspicions to be
                                unfounded and to have caused injury to the captain or the owners of
                                the vessel. With all the more reason this must be true in the case
                                of a prolonged detention which was wholly uncalled for, and which
                                was not justified by the allegation of any fraud.</p>
                            <p>Besides, other vessels have been in the same case as the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Sullberg</hi>, and have been obliged by the
                                political situation of the Philippines to give up discharging their
                                goods. The local government, so far from detaining them, has
                                facilitated their departure.</p>
                            <p>Why was an exception made in the case of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Sullberg</hi>, and why were these vexatious measures taken
                                against her?</p>
                            <p>The captain of the <hi rend="italic">Sullberg</hi> in no way objected
                                to admitting the local authorities on board of his vessel, and the
                                custom-house officers who were placed on board might easily have
                                ascertained that the vessel carried no arms or munitions of war.</p>
                            <p>If the American Government had been able, in the beginning, to
                                conceive the slightest suspicion, the loyal attitude of the captain
                                ought to have been sufficient to dispel it.</p>
                            <p>The charterers, whose commercial uprightness is well known, earnestly
                                protest against any such suspicion.</p>
                            <p>As soon as they were able to do so without subjecting themselves to
                                inadmissible demands, they made it a point to justify
                                themselves.</p>
                            <p>On the 6th day of March, when the <hi rend="italic">Sullberg</hi>
                                arrived at Hongkong, Mr. A. R. Marty, their agent, wrote to the
                                United States consul-general, informing him of the vessel’s arrival,
                                and requesting him to send a representative to witness the discharge
                                of the cargo of salt.</p>
                            <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0230"/>
                            <p>The consul-general was pleased to comply with this desire, and his
                                delegate ascertained that there were neither arms nor munitions of
                                war on board of the <hi rend="italic">Sullberg.</hi></p>
                            <p>Owing to the numerous obstacles placed in the way of the discharge of
                                the rice, and by the detention of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Sullberg</hi> for seventeen days at Manila, the United States
                                Government caused a serious loss to Messrs. Marty &amp;
                                d’Abbadie.</p>
                            <p>This detention, as we have just shown, was in violation of the law of
                                nations, and can not be justified by any of the necessities which
                                are allowable in case of war, in favor of the belligerents. It took
                                place without any good reason, on a mere suspicion of fraud, which
                                had no foundation whatever.</p>
                            <p>The United States Government must itself have recognized this, since
                                it authorized the departure of the <hi rend="italic">Sullberg</hi>
                                after she had been illegally detained for seventeen days.</p>
                            <p>It is, therefore, under obligations to furnish redress for the injury
                                which it caused.</p>
                            <p>It remains for us to establish the amount of the damage done.</p>
                            <p>This damage is composed of five elements, to wit: <list>

                                        postponement of that sale. The 18,000 piculs of salt were,
                                        as we have already remarked, to be taken to Iloilo, where
                                        they were to be sold at one piaster per picul. The salt had
                                        to be sent to Hongkong, where its average price per picul is
                                        but 50 cents. On its arrival, however, it could find no
                                        purchasers. In the interval which elapsed between February
                                        10 (meaning 13th) and March 6 (meaning 2d)—that is, during
                                        the detention of the vessel at Manila—the Hongkong market
                                        had been supplied. It was therefore necessary to warehouse
                                        it, and its sale will hardly be possible in less than three
                                        or four months, while the cost of warehousing, etc., will be
                                        about 10 cents per picul. The failure to earn in consequence
                                        of the action taken by the American authorities at Manila is
                                        therefore 5.60 (meaning 0.60) cents per picul, or a total of
                                        10,800 piasters.</item>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to Ambassador
                            Cambon’s note of January 7 last, in which he transmitted the memorial of
                            Messrs. Marty &amp; d’Abbadie, French citizens, preferring a claim
                            against this Government for $22,471, on account of the detention at
                            Manila for a period of seventeen days in February and March, 1899, of
                            the ship <hi rend="italic">Sullberg.</hi></p>
                        <p>In this note Mr. Cambon stated that the <hi rend="italic">Sullberg</hi>
                            “found it impossible, owing to events then transpiring at Iloilo, to
                            carry to that port merchandise that was booked for it, and for seventeen
                            days the head of the customs service at Manila refused to allow the said
                            vessel to sail for Asia with that merchandise,” and that in the opinion
                            of his Government the pretension of the American authorities seemed
                            contrary to the rules followed in all merchant countries. He asserted
                            that the principle which is constantly followed in all policed States is
                            that the master of a merchant vessel laden with merchandise is permitted
                            to discharge in the port for which it is bound or at which it may put in
                            such part only of the cargo as he may designate for the purpose, either
                            of his own motion or under the orders of his employers; that only the
                            part of the merchandise so designated that is entered for consumption is
                            subject to customs duties, and not such as may be warehoused in bond or
                            manifested for transit. He added: “The pretension to which Messrs. Marty
                            &amp; d’Abbadie object is so clearly contrary to the prevalent usages
                            that it seems to rest on the personal decision of a customs official and
                            not on any formal provision of the new customs regulations of the
                            Philippines to which it seems that General Otis would not have failed to
                            refer in a precise manner if the possibility of such a reference had
                            occurred to him.”</p>
                        <p>The claimants also complain that they were delayed about twelve <pb
                                n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0232"/>days in landing the rice,
                            because of difficulties thrown in the way by American authorities, and
                            that during this time a large quantity of rice (94.74 piculs) was
                            stolen.</p>
                        <p>The statement of the claimants upon which the statement in Mr. Cambon’s
                            note is evidently based, that a part of the cargo (the salt) was
                            destined to Iloilo, is incorrect. The manifest shows that the entire
                            cargo was consigned to Manila. A copy of that document is inclosed
                                herewith.<note n="a" xml:id="d122fna">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>The only entry made at Manila, however, was for the rice. When the vessel
                            had discharged the rice the consignee asked for a clearance to Hongkong
                            without discharging the balance of the cargo, which consisted of
                            1,099,600 kilos of salt in bulk. Under paragraph 3 of the United States
                            provisional customs tariff and regulations then in force, promulgated in
                            General Orders, No. 10, from the office of the military governor in the
                            Philippines under date of October 26, 1898, clearance of the vessel
                            could not be granted until all her cargo had been landed and accounted
                            for. The request of the consignees was therefore refused. The
                            regulations prohibiting the clearance of a vessel under such
                            circumstances were taken from the existing United States customs
                            regulations, and it is submitted that they were not unreasonable under
                            the conditions existing.</p>
                        <p>It may be observed, moreover, that the military governor had been advised
                            that the <hi rend="italic">Sullberg</hi> was suspected of having arms
                            concealed on board and had instructed the collector to have a careful
                            examination made of all cargo discharged therefrom, and after the cargo
                            had been completely discharged to make a thorough search of the vessel.
                            The character of the cargo—salt in bulk—offered the greatest facilities
                            for the concealment of arms and other contraband.</p>
                        <p>After the vessel had been detained for a period of seventeen days she was
                            cleared, under a suspension of the operation of the regulation which the
                            military governor had the power to authorize, without having discharged
                            the salt cargo. The authorities in the Philippines state that this
                            suspension was not made because either the military governor or the
                            collector was convinced that the suspected arms were not on board, but
                            for other reasons which seemed satisfactory to the military
                            governor.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the statement of the claimants relative to the delay in
                            landing the rice and of the theft of a portion thereof, the collector of
                            the port at Manila reports that “the claimants were not delayed in
                            landing their rice cargo by any conditions thrown in the way by the
                            American authorities, and no claim or statement was ever submitted to
                            this office as to the loss of 94.74 piculs of rice (estimated value
                            $236.85) which claimants state were stolen. The examination of this rice
                            was made on board the vessel, and it was released by the customs
                            officials in charge at the ship’s side, hence, if any part of the cargo
                            was stolen, the theft must have occurred after the rice had been
                            released by this department, and was under full control of the
                            consignees or their agent.”</p>
                        <p>The Department perceives no basis for a claim for an indemnity in behalf
                            of Messrs. Marty &amp; d’Abbadie.</p>

                            country.</hi></p>
                        <p>The information given below is believed to be correct, yet is not to
                            considered as official, as it relates to the laws and regulations of a
                            foreign country.</p>
                        <p>All Frenchmen who are not declared unfit or excused may be called upon
                            for military duty between the ages of 20 and 45 years. They are obliged
                            to serve three years in the active army, ten in the reserve of the
                            active army, six in the territorial army, and six in the reserve of the
                            territorial army.</p>
                        <p>If released from all military obligations in France, or if the
                            authorization of the French Government was obtained beforehand,
                            naturalization of a former French citizen in the United States is
                            accepted by the French Government; but a Frenchman naturalized abroad
                            without the consent of his Government, and who at the time of his
                            naturalization was still subject to military service in the active army
                            or in the reserve of the active army, is held to be amenable to the
                            French military laws. Not having responded to the notice calling him to
                            accomplish his military service, he is placed on the list of those
                            charged with noncompliance with the military laws, and if he returns to
                            France he is liable to arrest, trial, and upon conviction is turned over
                            to the army, active, reserve, or territorial, according to his age. Long
                            absence from France and old age do not prevent this action.</p>
                        <p>A Frenchman naturalized abroad, after having passed the age of service in
                            the active army and the reserve, nevertheless continues on the military
                            list until he has had his name struck from the rolls, which may usually
                            be done by his sending his naturalization certificate through the United
                            States embassy to the proper French authorities.</p>
                        <p>The French Government rarely gives consent to a Frenchman of military age
                            to throw off his allegiance. Application on the subject may, however, be
                            addressed to the minister of justice at Paris, accompanied by a full
                            statement of the particulars and a fee of 675 francs. If the request is
                            granted, the name of the person concerned is erased from the military
                            list and he may return to France safely.</p>
                        <p>There is no treaty between the United States and France defining the
                            status of former French citizens who have become naturalized American
                            citizens.</p>
                        <p>Passports are not necessary to enter France, but are usually required
                            from sojourners or travelers afterwards. They are recognized without
                            being visaed or indorsed.</p>

                            particular piece of brass tubing which was required could not be

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Some time ago a naturalized American of
                            French origin, Mr. Emile Robin, applied to this embassy for the purpose
                            of having his name erased from the French military rolls. Robin was born
                            in France on the 9th of January, 1869. After having served in the active
                            army the full term of three years, to which every Frenchman has to
                            submit, he proceeded to the United States, where he was naturalized
                            March 31, 1900. At that time, although released from the active army, he
                            was still liable to serve in the reserve, and therefore, according to
                            the <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0237"/>French law of June 26,
                            1889, new article 17 of the code, he could not renounce his French
                            nationality without the consent of his Government.</p>
                        <p>At his urgent request the embassy applied, nevertheless, for his complete
                            discharge from all military obligations in France, and I am now in
                            receipt of Mr. Delcassé’s reply. The application is refused, on the
                            ground that, as the period during which Robin is liable to serve in the
                            active army (comprising the reserve) only expires on the 12th of March,
                            1903, when he would be transferred to the territorial army, and further,
                            as he failed to apply to the authorities to obtain consent to change his
                            nationality, his naturalization in the United States has no value in the
                            eyes of the French Government.</p>
                        <p>Such reply was fully expected and contains nothing new, but it defines
                            the position the French Government takes when cases of this kind arise,
                            in a manner so precise that I have deemed it advisable to send you a
                            copy and translation of it.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Chargé d’affaires</hi>: The 3d of July last
                                the ambassador of the United States applied for my mediation to
                                obtain the striking off our army roll of Mr. Robin (Emile), who had
                                obtained American naturalization on the 31st of March, 1900.</p>
                            <p>My colleague, the minister of war, to whom I hastened to refer the
                                matter, informs me that the result of the information collected by
                                his department is that Mr. Robin has not been authorized by the
                                French Government to be naturalized abroad. By the terms of article
                                17 of the Civil Code, if a Frenchman is still subject to the
                                obligations of military service in the active army, naturalization
                                abroad will not cause him to lose the quality of Frenchman unless it
                                was authorized by the French Government.</p>
                            <p>As Mr. Robin would have been transferred to the territorial army only
                                on March 12, 1903, he was subject to the formality of an
                                authorization when he acquired, in 1900, his American
                                naturalization. That authorization not having been applied for, the
                                naturalization acquired in America by Mr. Robin is without value in
                                the eyes of the French Goverment.</p>
                            <p>General André charges me, in these circumstances, to express to you
                                his regret at being unable to order the striking off of Mr. Robin’s
                                name from our army roll.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that on the
                            11th ultimo the embassy was informed by the consulate at Hamburg that
                            Max Friedrich Schaaf had been ordered to leave that city within fourteen
                            days, and that intervention was at once made in Schaaf’s behalf to the
                            end that he might be permittsd to remain there until the autumn of 1901,
                            or, if that were not convenient, until next spring (F. P. No. 846.)
                            Schaaf was born at Leipzig in 1872 and emigrated with his parents in
                            1882 to the United States, where he became a citizen through the
                            naturalization of his father in 1889. After his father’s death he
                            returned to Leipzig, in September, 1899, where he remained for about a
                            year, then going to Altona, near Hamburg. A short time after his arrival
                            in that city he was expelled from Prussia on account, it is said, of his
                            father having neglected to obtain his release from German allegiance
                            before his immigration, and he then moved to Hamburg, whereupon he soon
                            received the order referred to above.</p>
                        <p>To-day I have been informed by the foreign office that, in view of the
                            embassy’s interest in the case, Schaaf will be allowed to remain in
                            Hamburg until April, but that the senate of the “Free and Hanse City”
                            felt compelled to maintain the order of expulsion, as it was assumed
                            that Schaaf had emigrated in order to evade military service.</p>

                            when 10 years old, became a citizen through the naturalization of his

                            Germany, should indicate a purpose to hold all American citizens of
                            German origin, who emigrated during minority, amenable to the imputation
                            of intention to evade military service, no matter what their age may
                            have been at the time of emigration. Whilst it may be licit to deduce
                            from the facts of any particular case that the emigration of the minor
                            was for the sole purpose of evading military service and that conditions
                            exist in his instance which make his return to and sojourn in his native
                            place detrimental to public order or interests, the application of this
                            exceptional procedure to all minor emigrants would not be in consonance
                            with the spirit and intent of the existing conventions of naturalization
                            between the two countries, and would in fact almost amount to the
                            injection into the treaty stipulations of a requirement of prior consent
                            to change of allegiance, a requirement not admitted by the negotiators
                            of those conventions.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt this morning of your instruction No. 1159, referring to the
                            expulsion case of Max Friedrich Schaaf, and in this connection to report
                            that the embassy’s dispatch No. 1510, with regard to this case contained
                            practically the whole (not a summary) of the foreign office’s note in
                            question. Of late the foreign office has refrained from entering upon
                            any discussion of such cases. The position taken by the royal Prussian
                            authorities is that it is to be presumed that any one who emigrates from
                            Prussia without having performed military service emigrated for the
                            purpose of evading such service, the age of the person in question at
                            the time of his emigration not being taken into account. The Prussian
                            authorities hold that no such person should be allowed to settle in
                            Prussia or to make a prolonged visit in that country while still of an
                            age when, had he remained a Prussian subject, he might be called upon
                            for military service. They consider that the provisions of the Bancroft
                            treaties are sufficiently complied with if the person in question is
                            allowed to visit his former home and to remain there a few weeks; and of
                            late years, in certain parts of the country, expulsion orders have
                            become more or less frequent. The question of having obtained permission
                            to change allegiance does not appear to influence the case, the idea
                            being merely that a person should not be able, through a few years’
                            residence abroad and naturalization in a foreign country, to return to
                            his native place and to there sojourn free from the duties and
                            obligations of other men of the same age who have lived there
                            continuously. It sometimes happens, of course, that local officials show
                            too much zeal and that there is real hardship connected with a case of
                            expulsion, but it must not be forgotten that the number of persons
                            expelled or otherwise molested on account of their not having performed
                            military service is relatively very small when considered in connection
                            with the great number of American citizens of German origin who visit
                            their former homes every year.</p>
                        <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0240"/>
                        <p>In Germany a record is kept of every male child born in the country. At
                            the beginning of each calendar year official notice is published to the
                            effect that all males born during the twentieth preceding calendar year
                            are to report for examination as to their fitness for military service.
                            At the end of the year proceedings are taken against all those who have
                            failed to report, and they are all sentenced to pay a fine or undergo
                            imprisonment, and warrants are issued for their arrest. When such a
                            person returns from the United States or any other country, unless the
                            fact of his change of nationality is recorded and his name has been
                            taken from the lists, he is liable at any time to be called upon to pay
                            the fine, the same being almost invariably refunded, in the case of an
                            American citizen, upon intervention being made by the embassy. In Zahl’s
                            case he was probably sentenced several years before he became a citizen
                            of the United States.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I beg to call attention to Mr. Kasson’s dispatch No.
                            124, of January 6, 1885, and to the inclosures therein. (<ref

                        <p>The information given below is believed to be correct, yet is not to be
                            considered as official, as it relates to the laws and regulations of a
                            foreign country.</p>
                        <p>A German subject is liable to military service from the time he has
                            completed the 17th year of his age until his 45th year, active service
                            lasting from the beginning of his 20th year to the end of his 36th
                            year.</p>
                        <p>A German who emigrates before he is 17 years old, or before he has been
                            actually called upon to appear before the military authorities, may,
                            after a residence in the United States of five years and after due
                            naturalization, return to Germany on a visit, but his right to remain in
                            his former home is denied by Germany, and he may be expelled after a
                            brief sojourn on the ground that he left Germany merely to evade
                            military service. It is not safe for a person who has once been expelled
                            to return to Germany without having obtained permission to do so in
                            advance. A person who has completed his military service and has reached
                            his 31st year and become an American citizen may safely return to
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>The treaties between the United States and the German States provide that
                            German subjects who have become citizens of the United States shall be
                            recognized as such upon their return to Germany if they resided in the

                        <p>But a naturalized American of German birth is liable to trial and

                            committed before emigration, saving always the limitations of the laws
                            of Germany. If he emigrated after he was enrolled as a recruit in the

                            absence for a limited time; if, having an unlimited leave or being in
                            the reserve, he emigrated after receiving a call into service or after a
                            public proclamation requiring his appearance, or after war broke out, he
                            is liable to trial and punishment on return.</p>

                            petition the sovereign of his native State for relief, but this
                            Government can not act as intermediary in presenting the petition.</p>
                        <p>Travelers are not required to show passports on entering or leaving
                            Germany, but they are likely to be called upon to establish their
                            identity and citizenship at any time, and especially so if living in
                            boarding houses or renting apartments. They are consequently recommended
                            to provide themselves with passports. They do not usually require to be
                            visaed or indorsed, but the local authorities sometimes demand a German
                            translation.</p>

                            to inform you, in reply to your note of February 9, that the
                            Attorney-General had brought the matter of the alleged violation of the
                            consular convention of 1871, between the United States and Germany, by
                            the United States marshal at Philadelphia, in libeling the
                            Hamburg-American Line steamship <hi rend="italic">Assyria</hi> without
                            first having notified the German consul at that city, to the attention
                            of the marshal and had instructed him to avoid in future any similar
                            occurrence in contravention of the terms of the convention.</p>
                        <p>I am now in receipt of a communication from the Attorney-General, dated
                            February 26, stating that, after further consideration of the language
                            of Article XII of the consular convention referred to, it appears to him
                            that the previous notice to be given to the consular officers of the
                            respective nations relates only to an examination or <pb n="163"
                                xml:id="pg_163" facs="0243"/>search of merchant vessels by judicial
                            authorities or custom-house officials, and to the taking of the
                            depositions or statements of officers or persons belonging to the crew
                            of a vessel of the respective nations, to be made or used in judicial
                            proceedings. In his judgment, therefore, the service of a writ of
                            attachment upon a vessel is not within the language or intent of said
                            Article XII; and as immediate service of such a writ is often the very
                            essence of the claimant’s or creditor’s right, as showing due diligence,
                            especially where preferences are concerned, he thinks the reasons are
                            obvious why the service of an ordinary attachment was not intended to
                            be, and was not in fact embraced, in the proceedings which require
                            previous notice under Article XII of the treaty aforesaid.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: By a note, No. 565, of
                            March 1 of this year, relative to the attachment of the steamer <hi
                                rend="italic">Assyria</hi>, of Hamburg, your excellency communicated
                            to the imperial ambassador a letter, dated February 26 of this year,
                            from the Attorney-General, in which he declared that upon further
                            examination of Article XII of the consular convention of December 11,
                            1871, concluded between the United States of America and Germany, he had
                            formed the opinion, at variance with his earlier view, that the
                            attachment of merchant vessels did not come within the class of judicial
                            proceedings previous notice of which is to be given to the consular
                            officer under Article XII of the aforesaid consular convention.</p>
                        <p>The contents of your excellency’s note have been brought to the knowledge
                            of the Imperial Government, by which I am now instructed to make the
                            following communication to your excellency.</p>
                        <p>The Imperial Government is unable to concur in the opinion advanced in
                            the Attorney-General’s letter of the 26th of February of this year and
                            repeated in your excellency’s note of March 1 last. To be sure, the
                            attachment of vessels is not specially mentioned in the aforesaid
                            convention at its proper place, yet, in the opinion of the Imperial
                            Government, it is to be assimilated to the cases enumerated in Article
                            XIII, loco citato, and in like manner requires that the consular officer
                            be called upon.</p>
                        <p>The Imperial Government has always adhered to the opinion that the
                            obligation of notifying the imperial consular officers concerned
                            extends, if not to all official proceedings of American local
                            authorities on board German merchant vessels, at least to all such as
                            affect the interests of the vessel or its service.</p>
                        <p>This view has been upheld by the Imperial Government in several
                            instances, and notably in connection with the conflict between police
                            officers of Hoboken and firemen of the Norddeutschen Lloyd steamer <pb
                                n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0244"/><hi rend="italic">Elbe</hi> in
                            1890, and has been conceded in Assistant Secretary William F. Wharton’s
                            note of June 19, 1891.</p>
                        <p>Among the official proceedings of American authorities affecting the
                            interests of the vessel or its service, an attachment is indeed to be
                            placed in the first rank, and it has been thus expressly conceded by the
                            Government of the United States itself in the cases of attachment of the
                            vessels <hi rend="italic">Schleswig, Rhaetia, Magdalene</hi>, and <hi
                                rend="italic">R. C. Rickmers</hi>. I venture, in this respect, to
                            refer to the note<note n="a" xml:id="d137fna">Not printed.</note> of
                            Secretary of State John Sherman, of November 9, 1897, No. 395; the
                                notes<note n="a" xml:id="d137fnb">Not printed.</note> of Secretary
                            of State William R. Day, of June 2, 1898, No. 60, and of the 23d of
                            August of the same year, No. 99; and the note<note n="a"
                                xml:id="d137fnc">Not printed.</note> of Assistant Secretary of State
                            David J. Hill, of the 19th of April of last year, No. 417.</p>
                        <p>The Imperial Government does indeed grant that an attachment must in most
                            cases be executed without delay. But this does not come in support of
                            the opinion advanced by the Attorney-General, because the obligation to
                            call upon the assistance of the consuls in the proceedings under
                            consideration has never been understood otherwise than that a
                            notification of any official proceeding whatever was to take place
                            before execution only when its object was not to be defeated by reason
                            of the loss of time thereby involved, but that a notification given
                            immediately after entering upon its execution would be deemed
                            sufficient. Vessels of a foreign nation in Germany enjoy a similar
                            right.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances, the Imperial Government thinks it may express
                            its expectation that the United States Government will not depart from
                            the interpretation of article 12 of the consular convention as accepted
                            in the above-mentioned cases, and that the attachment of a vessel will,
                            as heretofore, be counted among the official proceedings therein
                            specified, which require a previous notification.</p>
                        <p>While respectfully asking that your excellency will take the views of the
                            Imperial Government as herein presented into favorable consideration and
                            favor me with a reply at your convenience, I avail myself of this
                            opportunity to renew, etc.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to state that I have
                                given careful consideration to your letter of November 19 and to the
                                note from the German embassy which you inclose, with its
                                accompanying papers, relative to the construction of Article XII of
                                the convention of 1871 between the United States and Germany. The
                                language of that article is that “the judicial authorities and
                                custom-house officials shall in no case proceed to the examination
                                or search of merchant vessels without having given previous notice
                                to the consular officers of the nation to which the said vessels
                                belong, in order to enable the said consular officers to be
                                present.” The concluding paragraph of the article provides for
                                giving such notice when statements by officers or members of a crew
                                are to be made in court or before a magistrate, in order to prevent
                                error or false interpretation which might impede the correct
                                administration of justice.</p>
                            <p>The view of Mr. Griggs (letter of February 26, 1901), to which the
                                embassy’s note refers, was that the service of a writ of attachment
                                upon a vessel is not within the language or the intent of this
                                article of the treaty, especially since immediate service of such
                                writ is often the very essence of the right of a claimant or
                                creditor. The note of the German embassy, while claiming that the
                                service of attachments is covered by the language of Article XII,
                                concedes generally that when the object of the proceedings can
                                otherwise not be attained, or be attained but partially, the
                                obligation to give previous notice is so far qualified, and that the
                                proximity of a vessel’s departure justifies the failure to notify
                                before the attachment is effected, provided due notice is
                                subsequently given.</p>
                            <p>On review of the entire subject, I concur in the conclusion announced
                                in my predecessor’s letter of February 26, 1901, viz, “that the
                                reasons are obvious why the service of an ordinary attachment was
                                not intended to be and was not in fact embraced in the proceedings
                                which require previous notice under Article XII of the treaty.”</p>
                            <p>Very respectfully,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that in
                            December last, under general instructions from the Department,
                            intervention was made in behalf of Lewis T. Cannon and Jacob Müller,
                            American citizens, who had been residing in Cologne, “in the capacity of
                            missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
                            (otherwise known as the Mormon Church),” who had been found “lästig”
                            (troublesome, objectionable) by the local authorities “because of the
                            preaching and practice” of their religion, and who had consequently been
                            expelled from Prussia. In the case of Mr. Müller, who had no present
                            intention to return to Germany, the request was made that the order for
                            his expulsion might be recalled, so that he might not be liable to
                            arrest and punishment in case he ever found it desirable to make another
                            visit. Mr. Müller is a naturalized American citizen of Wurttemberg
                            origin, and is about 60 years old. Mr. Cannon, however, who is a native
                            American citizen, wished to be allowed to return to Prussia as a student
                            in case he should not be permitted to do so as a missionary.</p>
                        <p>To-day the embassy is in receipt of a note from the imperial foreign
                            office in which it is stated that the Royal Prussian Government does <pb

                            expulsion or to permit Cannon to stay in Prussia as a student. This
                            information has at once been communicated to Mr. Cannon, who was at
                            Zurich, Switzerland, when last heard from, and he has been asked to
                            communicate it to Mr. Müller, whose address is not known to the
                            embassy.</p>

                            <p>1. Ladislaus Golus brought his case to the attention of the embassy
                                in May, 1900, and after certain correspondence the embassy
                                intervened in his behalf (F. O., No. 704), on the 17th of that
                                month.</p>
                            <p>Golus was born at Gollub in 1873, and emigrated in 1890 to the United
                                States, where he duly became naturalized as a citizen in New York,
                                in April, 1900. He returned on a visit to Gollub soon thereafter,
                                and on May 12 he had been arrested and kept in prison, in spice of
                                his protest as an American citizen, until he had paid a fine on
                                account of his nonperformance of military service.</p>
                            <p>The embassy again invited attention to this case on June 21, 1900 (F.
                                O., No. 735), September 10 and 17 (F. O., Nos. 804 and 810), and
                                December 20 (F. 0.,No. 849). Under date of January 14, 1901, Golus
                                having in the meantime returned to the United States, the foreign
                                office notified the embassy that the money in question would be
                                refunded to his father at Gollub.</p>
                            <p>2. Xaver Sylvester Balz informed the embassy in December, 1900, that
                                he wished to visit his former home in Alsace, had made the usual
                                formal request, and hoped that the embassy would support the same.
                                He had been born at Buchsweiler in 1863, and when 18 years old had
                                emigrated to the United States, where he had duly become naturalized
                                as a citizen.</p>
                            <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0248"/>
                            <p>On January 5, 1901 (F. O., No. 862), and again on the 10th of the
                                same month, Balz, having informed the embassy in the meantime that
                                the minister for Alsace-Lorraine at Strassburg had refused his
                                request, owing to the fact that a warrant had been issued for his
                                arrest on account of his evasion of military duty, the embassy
                                communicated with the foreign office in regard to the case, and
                                under date of January 24 a reply was received to the effect that
                                permission had been granted Balz to visit Buchsweiler for six weeks
                                at some time before the 1st of next June.</p>
                            <p>3. The brothers Michael, Nicholas, and Mathias Gent brought their
                                case to the attention of the embassy in April, 1900, and, after
                                correspondence, intervention was made in their behalf (F. O., No.
                                715), on May 30. They were born at Büschdorf in 1866, 1870, and
                                1874, respectively, had emigrated to the United States, and had duly
                                become naturalized as citizens at Creston, Iowa, where all three now
                                reside. Recently their representative at their former home had been
                                compelled to pay fines amounting in all to 624.21 marks on account
                                of their not having reported for military service.</p>
                            <p>Attention was again called to this case in June, September, and
                                December, 1900, and under date of January 29, 1901, the foreign
                                office notified the embassy that the fines had been remitted and the
                                money paid would be refunded.</p>
                            <p>4. Henry Kauffmann, writing from his home in the United States,
                                informed the embassy that he desired to be permitted to make a visit
                                to his former home in Alsace, and had already been in correspondence
                                with the imperial ministry at Strassburg in the matter. On January
                                29, 1901, the embassy addressed a note (F. O., No. 882) to the
                                imperial foreign office in support of Kauffmann’s request, and under
                                date of February 21 it was informed that permission had been granted
                                him to visit Strassburg for three weeks.</p>
                            <p>5. Alfred Nachtigall’s case was brought to the attention of the
                                embassy on January 22, 1901, and intervention was at once (F. O.,
                                No. 880) made in his behalf. Nachtigall had emigrated to the United
                                States from Germany without having performed military service, and
                                had duly become naturalized as a citizen in 1890, at Grand Rapids,
                                Mich., at which place he continued to reside. A previous effort,
                                made by his father, to obtain his release from German allegiance was
                                said to have been unsuccessful. Under date of March 23, the embassy
                                was notified by the foreign office that Nachtigall had been
                                recognized as an American citizen and his name taken from the German
                                military lists.</p>

                            <p>1. Sigmund Meyers (Mayer) emigrated from Germany to the United States
                                about nine years ago, and duly became naturalized as a citizen in
                                Philadelphia, on May 29, 1899. On account of his not having appeared
                                for military service, his father (it was claimed), in Bavaria, had
                                been ordered to pay a fine. The case was brought to the attention of
                                the embassy by Messrs. Gutman Klein &amp; Son, of Philadelphia, and
                                under date of February 12, 1901, intervention (F. O., No. 894) was
                                made in Meyers’s <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0249"/>behalf to
                                the end that he “be recognized as an American citizen, his name
                                taken from the German military lists, and all proceedings against
                                him on account of his failure to present himself for military
                                service stopped.”</p>
                            <p>Under date of April 11, the foreign office replied to the embassy’s
                                note, stating that Meyers’s name had been taken off the military
                                lists and that no criminal proceedings had been commenced against
                                him on account of his evasion of military service.</p>
                            <p>2. Diedrich Ebken was born in Bremen in 1876, and emigrated in 1891
                                to the United States, where he became naturalized as a citizen at
                                Cincinnati in 1900. In January, 1901, he returned to Bremen on a
                                visit, when he was almost immediately informed that he must leave
                                the country. At his own request, however, permission was granted him
                                to remain until April 5. He was nevertheless arrested soon after and
                                compelled to pay a fine of 200 marks, on account of his not having
                                performed military service. His case was reported to the embassy by
                                the consul at Bremen, and under date of March 19, 1901, intervention
                                (F. O., No. 915) was made in his behalf.</p>
                            <p>Under date of April 16, Consul Diederich informed the embassy that
                                Ebken’s fine had been refunded (this information being confirmed by
                                the foreign office on April 25) and the money forwarded to him at
                                his home in the United States.</p>
                            <p>3. Gustav A. Seitz, an American citizen of German origin residing in
                                Zumbrota, Minn., brought his case to the attention of the embassy hi
                                November, 1900. He had emigrated from Baden without having performed
                                military service, and although permission had been granted him to
                                visit his former home, it appeared uncertain that he had been fully
                                recognized as an American citizen. Seitz had addressed a petition to
                                the Grand Duke of Baden, and under date of March 1, 1901, the
                                embassy notified the foreign office (F. O., No. 901) that it desired
                                to give all proper support to the same. Seitz had exhibited evidence
                                of his naturalization in the United States in 1881.</p>
                            <p>Under date of April 19 the foreign office informed the embassy that
                                it had communicated with the Baden authorities in regard to the
                                case, and that they would communicate directly with Seitz, from whom
                                the embassy subsequently learned that he had been notified that he
                                was at liberty to visit Baden under the same conditions as all other
                                foreigners could do so, and that he was not liable to any military
                                obligation.</p>
                            <p>4. Louis Wiess emigrated to the United States from Alsace-Lorraine in
                                1873, after having been drafted for military service. He became
                                naturalized as a citizen in 1878. In March, 1901, he made
                                application to the imperial authorities at Strassburg (as instructed
                                to do by the embassy in May, 1900) for permission to visit his
                                former home for two months, and on April 1 (F. O., No. 921) the
                                embassy addressed a note to the foreign office in support of his
                                request.</p>
                            <p>On April 29 the embassy was informed by the foreign office that Wiess
                                had been granted permission to spend six weeks at his former home at
                                some time during the current year.</p>
                            <p>5. (John) Jacob Häberle had been in personal correspondence with the
                                authorities of the Kingdom of Wurttemberg (from which he had
                                emigrated to the United States) and had encountered difficulties in
                                effecting his recognition as an American citizen. He first brought
                                his case to the attention of the embassy in the summer of 1900, and
                                after the required authentication of his papers intervention was
                                made in his behalf (F. O. No. 855) on December 28, 1900. Attention
                                was again called to the case (F. O. No. 911) on March 14, 1901.</p>
                            <p>A reply was received from the foreign office on May 11, in which it
                                was stated that Häberle had been recognized as an American citizen,
                                and that an attachment placed upon his property on account of his
                                evasion of military service had been removed.</p>
                            <p>6. Robert H. Just applied to the embassy in person on April 9, 1901,
                                and intervention (F. O. No. 924) was at once made in his behalf.
                                Just was born in Berlin in 1874 and, when 11 years of age, had been
                                taken by his parents to the United States, where he duly became a
                                citizen through the naturalization of his father while he was still
                                a minor. In October, 1900, he returned to Germany for the purpose of
                                studying music, and subsequently he was interrogated by the police
                                authorities and ordered to leave Prussia within four weeks from
                                April 1, or again become a German subject.</p>
                            <p>Under date of May 13, however, the foreign office informed the
                                embassy that the expulsion order had been recalled and that Just
                                would be permitted to remain in Berlin until further notice.</p>
                            <p>7. Siegmund Stern, a naturalized American citizen of German origin,
                                informed the embassy in a letter which was received on April 8,
                                1901, that he had been ordered <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170"
                                    facs="0250"/>to leave Prussia within fourteen days, and the
                                embassy at once (F. O. No. 923) made intervention in his behalf,
                                requesting, in accordance with Stern’s wish, that he be allowed to
                                remain until about the 1st of July. Stern stated that he had
                                important business to attend to and that he wished to be allowed to
                                stay at Schlüchtern for two months longer.</p>
                            <p>Under date of May 23 the foreign office informed the embassy that the
                                Prussian authorities did not find themselves in a position to cancel
                                the expulsion order, as Stern, who emigrated from Germany in 1890
                                without having performed military service had repeatedly returned
                                and had already been permitted to sojourn in Schlüchtern since July
                                1, 1900.</p>
                            <p>It is understood that Stern was not molested pending the final
                                decision of his case, and it will be noted that the decision that he
                                must go was not made until six weeks after attention had been called
                                to the case. He was consequently enabled to remain in Prussia up to
                                within about two weeks of the time when he intended to leave.</p>
                            <p>8. Max Kuechlin’s case—his arrest, imprisonment, and release, and the
                                ultimate refunding of his military fine in accordance with
                                intervention made by the embassy in April, 1901—has, it is
                                understood, been fully reported by the United States consul at
                                Freiburg, Baden.</p>

                            <p>1. Nick Britten commenced a correspondence with the embassy with
                                regard to his military status in April, 1900, the result of which
                                was that intervention was made in his behalf (F. O. No. 881) on
                                January 23, 1901, to the end that he be recognized as an American
                                citizen and his military fine remitted.</p>
                            <p>Britten was born in the Rheinprovinz in 1864, and had emigrated to
                                the United States in 1882, subsequently becoming naturalized as a
                                citizen in the State of Iowa, where he continues to reside. Certain
                                money coming to him by inheritance had been attached on account of
                                his failure to perform military service.</p>
                            <p>Attention was again invited to this case on February 26 (F. O. No.
                                900), March 14 (911), and June 19 (972), and under date of July 10,
                                1901, a note was received from the foreign office in which it was
                                stated that the fine which Britten had been sentenced to pay, on
                                April 6, 1887, had been remitted. The “costs” in this case were also
                                remitted.</p>
                            <p>2. Lawrence M. Metzger (see case No. 1, in report accompanying Mr.
                                Jackson’s dispatch No. 1416,<note n="a" xml:id="d146fna">Printed

                                        517</ref>.</note> of September 29, 1900) had been permitted
                                to make a visit to his former home in Germany, and after leaving for
                                the United States an application had been made for the remission of
                                his military fine (F. O. No. 77, of August 1, 1900).</p>
                            <p>Under date of August 18, 1901, a note was received from the foreign
                                office in which it was stated that the fine and the court’s costs
                                had been remitted. Certain other costs, amounting in all to 12
                                marks, had already been collected and this amount was not refunded.
                                No further action in the case is contemplated.</p>
                            <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0251"/>
                            <p>3. Herrmann E. Meisner brought his case to the attention of the
                                embassy in June, 1901, and on the 26th of that month intervention
                                (F. O. No. 982) was made in his behalf, to the end that he might be
                                allowed to remain in Prussia for about two months longer.</p>
                            <p>Meisner was born in Prussia in 1858. When about 20 years of age, and
                                after having been found unfit for military service, he emigrated to
                                the United States, where he duly became naturalized as a citizen in
                                1886. In 1892 he had remained in Germany for about two months
                                without molestation. In December, 1900, he had again returned, on a
                                visit to his mother, and on June 15 he had received an order to
                                leave Prussia within fourteen days, the order having been issued by
                                the Berlin police presidency.</p>
                            <p>Under date of August 21, the foreign office notified the embassy that
                                Meisner would be permitted to remain until September 15.</p>
                            <p>4. Friedrich Koch, as reported by the United States consul at Bremen,
                                was born in Prussia in 1872, and, after having obtained his release
                                from Prussian allegiance, emigrated to the United States in 1888. He
                                became naturalized as a citizen in due time, and passport No. 42878
                                was issued to him by the Department. He returned to Germany in July,
                                and soon thereafter he was notified by the local authorities at his
                                former home in Schleswig-Holstein, that he must leave the country by
                                September 2.</p>
                            <p>On August 13, 1901, intervention (F. O. No. 1006) was made by the
                                embassy in his behalf, as Koch wished to be permitted to remain in
                                Prussia until October 8, and under date of September 13 the foreign
                                office replied that he might do so until October 1—in view of the
                                special circumstances in this particular case.</p>
                            <p>5. August Meyer was born in Prussia in 1876 and emigrated to the
                                United States in 1892, where he duly became naturalized as a
                                citizen. He returned to Germany about July 1, 1901, and soon
                                thereafter he received an order from the local authorities to leave
                                within five days. As permission had been granted Meyer’s brother to
                                remain until September 1, the embassy made intervention in his
                                behalf (F. O. No. 998) on July 25 to the end that like permission
                                might be granted him.</p>
                            <p>As nothing further has been heard of this case, either from Meyer
                                himself or from the American consul at Bremen, by whom it was
                                brought to the attention of the embassy, it is presumed that Meyer
                                was able to finish his visit without further molestation and that he
                                has now returned to the United States.</p>

                            1743 of September 30, I have the honor to report that the only military
                            case—not already mentioned—which has been brought to a conclusion during
                            the quarter ending to-day is that of Karl Kammerer, and that almost no
                            such cases are pending at the present time.</p>
                        <p>The facts in Kammerer’s case are substantially as follows: Born near
                            Villingen, in the Grand Duchy of Baden, in 1869, he emigrated in 1886 to
                            the United States, were he duly became naturalized as a citizen in 1894.
                            In 1892 he was sentenced by the Baden authorities to pay a fine of 200
                            marks on account of his evasion of military service. This fine had not
                            been collected.</p>
                        <p>As Kammerer wished to make a visit to his native place, and as he feared
                            trouble unless this fine should be canceled, he brought his case to the
                            attention of the embassy, and intervention was made in his behalf (F. O.
                            No. 999) on July 30, last. Attention was again called to the case (F. O.
                            No. 1034) on September 27.</p>
                        <p>Under date of October 12, however, the embassy was informed by <pb
                                n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0252"/>the imperial foreign office
                            that the judgment against Kammerer would not be executed, and that there
                            was nothing to prevent his making the desired visit to his former home.
                            This information was communicated to Kammerer at his residence in the
                            United States (York, Pa.), and nothing has since been heard from
                            him.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that the
                            embassy has been requested by the Imperial foreign office to use its
                            good offices in the matter referred to herein. It will be remembered in
                            this connection that the German law relating to insurance against
                            disability and old age (see Mr. Coleman’s dispatch No. 182, of October
                            7, 1890) compels all persons working in a position of dependence upon
                            regular wages, unless the wages exceed a certain amount per annum, to
                            insure themselves against certain liabilities, the insurance to be
                            effected by means of stamps pasted on the insurance cards, one half the
                            cost of the stamp being paid by the employer, the other half by the
                            employee. It will also be remembered (see Mr. Phelps’s dispatch<note
                                n="a" xml:id="d148fna">Not printed.</note> No. 220, of January 13,
                            1891) that the members of this mission voluntarily submitted themselves
                            and their households (domestic servants alone being concerned) to the
                            provisions of this law at the time of its going into force, the same
                            course of action, so far as I am aware, having been pursued by those who
                            have joined the mission subsequently and by consular officials of the
                            United States generally throughout Germany.</p>
                        <p>And now I turn to the case in point. At our consulate at Breslau there
                            are employed (or were employed during the incumbency of Mr. Charles W.
                            Erdman) two German subjects—the one as secretary and the other as
                            messenger—whose cases fall within the provisions of the law mentioned
                            above. Were these two men employed under existing conditions by a German
                            or a nonofficial foreigner, both they and their employers would be
                            compelled to pay for the insurance stamps in the usual manner. Consul
                            Erdman, however, claimed that under Article III of the convention of
                            December 11, 1871, between the United States and the German Empire,
                            neither he nor they were obliged to do so, as they were employees of the
                            consulate, and as he was exempted from taxes of any kind whatsoever. The
                            foreign office, on the contrary, considers it doubtful if the consul is
                            freed from the obligation to contribute toward the payment for the
                            stamps by the treaty. It also says that, even if the two men concerned
                            are considered as officials of the United States, they have no claim to
                            any pension, and German Beam ten under similar conditions are not freed
                            from an obligation to insure. <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0253"
                            />The good offices of the embassy having on one or more occasions been
                            used in the cases of domestic servants employed by American consular
                            officers, the foreign office has now requested the embassy to act in the
                            case in point to the end that the two German subjects in question may
                            not be deprived of advantages which would come to them were they in
                            other employ.</p>
                        <p>On other occasions the embassy has usually written to the consul
                            concerned, explained the circumstances to him, and suggested his
                            complying with the law. The case in point, however, presents hew
                            features, and after talking it over with Consul-General Mason I decided
                            to submit it to the Department. There have always been uncertainties
                            about the exact meaning of Article III of the convention of 1871 in so
                            far as it refers to consular officers (vice and deputy consuls, etc.)
                            and employees of German nationality, but the general practice has been
                            to exempt such persons from taxation, although, so far as I am aware, no
                            formal decision in the matter has ever been made by the competent
                            authorities. It therefore seems possible that, if the question be made
                            one of principle, the existing practice may be changed to the
                            disadvantage of the parties concerned, and I personally think that this
                            would be quite probable, as I fail to see the reason for the exemption
                            of a German subject from local taxation merely because his employer
                            happens to be an American official. Consequently, in view of the
                            possibilities, I do not feel authorized to act in this matter without
                            instructions, and I therefore refer it to the Department for such action
                            as may be found proper.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department has received Mr. Jackson’s
                            No. 1604, of the 13th instant, relative to the question as to whether or
                            not a consul of the United States in Germany and German subjects in the
                            employ of an American consulate in Germany are exempt from the
                            employees’ insurance tax.</p>
                        <p>Under the provisions of Article III of the treaty of 1871 the consul at
                            Breslau, not being a German subject, is exempt from the payment of the
                            tax. But, in the opinion of the Department, that exemption can not be
                            claimed for the secretary and messenger of the consulate, who are German
                            subjects.</p>
                        <p>The Department notes Mr. Jackson’s statement that the members of the
                            embassy at Berlin and the United States consular officers generally
                            throughout the German Empire have voluntarily submitted themselves and
                            their employees to the provisions of the insurance tax law. The consul
                            at Breslau should be advised to follow the same course, as it is to the
                            advantage of his employees. He can undoubtedly arrange so that they
                            shall bear the payment of the quota of the contribution which he is
                            asked to pay.</p>

                        <p>I. On June 26, 1875, the Attorney-General of the United States rendered
                            an opinion that children who are born in the United States and whose
                            father is a naturalized American citizen shall be considered American
                            citizens even if their father has left the United States after the
                            children’s birth and renounced his American citizenship and
                            allegiance.</p>
                        <p>These children, however, shall be afforded an opportunity when they reach
                            the age of 21 of electing whether they will return and take the
                            nationality of their birth or retain the nationality acquired by the act
                            of their father.</p>
                        <p>II. In 1883, in the case of a young Jew, the Imperial German legation was
                            informed by the Department of State that the United States Government
                            had adopted the principle that minor children who were born within the
                            dominion of the United States do not lose their American citizenship eo
                            ipso if their father changes his nationality, but that these children
                            will be afforded an opportunity of making formal option of allegiance at
                            their coming of age.</p>
                        <p>III. In 1896 it was stated by the Department of State that a child of
                            foreign parents who was born in the United States and taken abroad by
                            his father during his minority shall retain, according to the point of
                            view established by the executive branch of the United States
                            Government, his American citizenship by birth in the United States and
                            may claim it after attaining majority.</p>
                        <p>It was added, however, that the executive branch of the United States
                            Government was not competent to declare this, but that this had to be
                            done by the competent court, either State or Federal, as the case may
                            be.</p>
                        <p>IV. In the case of a Chinese child born in the United States whose
                            parents had not been naturalized in the United States, and who had been
                            taken to China by his parents and wanted to return to this country
                            later, the United States Supreme Court stated in a decision rendered in
                            October, 1897, “that all children born within the dominion of the United
                            States of foreign parents holding no diplomatic office became American
                            citizens merely by birth.”</p>
                        <p>V. A decision contradictory to the previous decisions was issued by the
                            Treasury Department on February 28, 1899, No. 20747, stating that
                            children born in the United States of nonnaturalized aliens and taken
                            abroad by their father should, upon their return to this country, be
                            adjudged alien immigrants.</p>
                        <p>The papers in this latter case had been referred to the Solicitor of the
                            Treasury Department, who, after a careful review of the authorities,
                            rendered an opinion that a child born in this country of a foreign
                            father and taken abroad by his father, acquired said parent’s domicile
                            and nationality.</p>

                        <p>Relative to the matter of the contradiction between certain cases cited
                            in the memorandum of the German embassy of April 16, last, as determined
                            by the Department of State, the Attorney-General, and the Supreme Court
                            of the United States, and one determined by the Treasury Department,
                            announced on February 28, 1899, in Treasury, decision No. 20747, upon
                            the question of the nationality of a child born in the United States and
                            taken out of the country by his parents, the Department of State finds
                            upon investigation that the Treasury decision was overruled by the
                            district court of the United States for the southern district of New
                            York, which held that the two American-born children of Acberto Anselmo
                            and his wife, Giovanna, Italians, were not aliens but citizens of the
                            United States, and as such entitled to admission into the United States.
                            (Vide 93, Federal Reporter, 659.)</p>
                        <p>This decision of the district court is admitted, in a letter from the
                            Secretary of the Treasury of the 20th instant, to be binding and
                            conclusive upon that Department and is now followed by it.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As a matter of considerable importance
                                to a large class of American citizens, I have the honor to inclose a
                                copy of a letter recently addressed to the consul at Magdeburg by
                                the royal police praesidium at that place, which apparently
                                indicates <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0256"/>clearly that a
                                general order has recently been issued by the Prussian Government
                                restricting for our naturalized citizens of German birth the right
                                of temporary sojourn in Prussia, thus discriminating between our
                                native and naturalized citizens in what seems to me direct violation
                                of the protocols appended to the convention of February 22, 1868,
                                under which naturalized citizens are entitled to the same rights as
                                native citizens.</p>
                            <p>The recognized right of a government to expel individuals seems to me
                                to be a different thing from a general order which affects an entire
                                class, especially if it applies only to Germans who have become
                                American citizens and not to Germans who have been naturalized in
                                other countries.</p>
                            <p>If it be held that this is not a matter in which protest can properly
                                be made, are not our citizens of German birth at least entitled to
                                know of this decision in order that they may take the risk into
                                consideration before going to the expense of returning to Germany
                                for brief visits or as representatives and promoters of American
                                trade? (See circular of March 27, 1899.) During the year that I have
                                recently spent in Germany I have had five or six such cases, usually
                                poor people who have had no intention or desire to remain in Germany
                                more than a month or two. I have never known of a case where a
                                wealthy American citizen of German birth has been interfered with in
                                this way upon his return to Germany for prolonged or permanent
                                residence.</p>
                            <p>In every case which I have reported to the embassy it has succeeded
                                in obtaining for the person permission to extend his visit two or
                                three weeks, but in each instance the American citizen has informed
                                me that he would not have gone to the expense of the journey if he
                                had been cognizant of the fact that he could be expelled at once by
                                order of an official having local authority, no matter how peaceably
                                he might conduct himself.</p>
                            <p>In most such cases the object of the order of expulsion seems to be
                                merely to compel the individual to renounce his American
                                citizenship, thus removing the one obstacle to his enforced
                                enlistment in the German army. In some cases the expulsion may be
                                meant simply as a warning to would-be emigrants.</p>
                            <p>In the special case of Albert Ehrenstroem the embassy has asked for
                                an extension of his time, but I hope that the Department will decide
                                that it is right to give to the press the substance of the letter
                                addressed by the Royal Prussian police presidium at Magdeburg to
                                Consul Baehr.</p>

                            <p>Answer to a letter of December 12, 1900:</p>
                            <p>The order to Albert Ehrenstroem to leave Prussian territory before
                                February 1, 1901, is based upon an instruction from a higher source
                                under which Germans formerly liable for military service who return
                                to Germany after having acquired American citizenship are to be
                                permitted to remain only for a short time, which is to be measured
                                by the circumstances and purposes of their sojourn. The period
                                allowed in the above-mentioned case appears to be sufficient.</p>

                                <p>Memorandum: Ehrenstroem emigrated with his parents when he was 13
                                    years of age. He was then too young to serve in the army, and
                                    his emigration was not opposed. It is clear that he was not an
                                    evader of any obligation to the Prussian Government, but that as
                                    a child he naturally accompanied his parents.</p>

                                Frankfort Kleine Presse containing the same information as the
                                letter from the police president at Magdeburg, a copy of which
                                accompanied my former report.</p>
                            <p>It accordingly now appears certain that a general order has been
                                issued discriminating against such expatriated Germans as have
                                acquired American citizenship. No mention is made either in the
                                letter of the police president or in the inclosed newspaper article
                                of Germans who have acquired any other nationality.</p>
                            <p>It is furthermore of interest to our citizens of German birth who may
                                desire to visit their old homes or to settle in Germany as
                                representatives of American commercial houses and promoters of
                                American trade that the question as to how long they may be
                                permitted to remain is left to the decision of the local police
                                authorities, and that such permission can not be extended beyond
                                weeks or months at most, if the person emigrated without first
                                performing military service.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the State
                                Department’s instruction No. 1189, received by me on the 26th
                                ultimo, I have the honor to submit the following report:</p>
                            <p>After more than ten years’ experience at this post, and after having
                                had frequent conversations with my colleagues and with German
                                officials upon the subject of the expulsion of former German
                                subjects, I feel at liberty to say with positiveness that there is
                                no intention on the part of the Prussian Government to discriminate
                                against American citizens. In the question under consideration it is
                                very difficult to draw a parallel. In the first place, no other
                                treaty similar to our Bancroft treaties of 1868 exists between the
                                German Empire, or any German State, and any foreign country. In the
                                second place, obligatory military service exists in almost all
                                continental countries, <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0258"/>and
                                consequently the emigration of young Germans to those countries is
                                not considerable. Moreover, with many of these countries informal
                                understandings, or even formal agreements, exist, in accordance with
                                which their respective nationals are reciprocally handed over to
                                their home authorities where an attempt is made to evade military
                                service. Where no treaty exists the returned German is not
                                considered as entitled to be protected by the authorities of the
                                country in which he has acquired nationality, and he is generally
                                punished in accordance with German law without any intervention on
                                their part. This is even the case with British subjects, the
                                Department of State being probably aware of the fact that it is the
                                general practice of the British Government to decline to intervene
                                in behalf of a naturalized subject who returns to the land of his
                                birth. As there is no compulsory military service in Great Britain,
                                there is a comparatively large emigration of Germans to that
                                country, but, as I am informed by the British ambassador here, it
                                rarely happens that intervention is made in behalf of such a person
                                (even to ask for permission for one to spend a few weeks in Germany,
                                on a visit, or to make a cure at some watering place), although the
                                instances where they get into trouble are by no means
                                infrequent.</p>
                            <p>The general rule is to make it unpleasant for all persons of German
                                birth who have evaded military service in their native country,
                                whether their emigration took place for the purpose of evading such
                                service or not, upon their return to Germany after having acquired
                                another nationality, it being held by the authorities, especially
                                those in Prussia, that the sojourn of such persons for any length of
                                time causes discontent and dissatisfaction among their companions of
                                the same age who have remained at home. It is of course possible
                                that certain of the minor local officials may entertain particular
                                grudges against American citizens of German origin on account of the
                                frequency with which they have to do with annoying cases where they
                                are involved, but I am confident that these views are not shared by
                                the superior officials of the Prussian ministry of the interior, or
                                at all generally by their subordinates.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the order in the case of Albert Ehrenstroem (see
                                correspondence with Mr. George M. Murphy, consular clerk) and to the
                                recent general order, I have to state that I have been informed by
                                the Prussian ministry of the interior that attention has been merely
                                called to what has been the practice for a long time, so that
                                persons who do not know that objection exists to their renewing
                                their residence in Germany may not be subjected to hardship.</p>

                            1st ultimo, transmitting returns of passports issued by your embassy
                            during the preceding quarter, has been received.</p>
                        <p>Miss Ella Seemann applied for a passport through the consul at Hamburg,
                            and received one February 20, 1901, No. 2671. The form used was that
                            intended for a person claiming citizenship through the naturalization of
                            the parent, and she was required to produce her father’s naturalization
                            certificate. In another case—that of Miss Henrietta Augusta Herrmann,
                            whose application was also through the consul at Hamburg—the applicant
                            could not show her father’s naturalization certificate, but was required
                            to make the statements usually required from a person whose citizenship
                            is derived from the naturalization of the father. As both of these women
                            were, as their statements show, born in the United States and had not
                            forfeited their allegiance, they should not have been required to make
                            the statements <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0259"/>or produce the
                            proof which the consul required, their citizenship being derived, not
                            from their parents’ naturalization, but from the fact of their American
                            birth. The provisions of the statutes on this subject and the decisions
                            of the Federal courts, as well as this Department’s repeated rulings,
                            are based primarily upon the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of
                            the United States, which provides that “All persons born or naturalized

                                n="a" xml:id="d155fna">Not printed.</note> from Bernard D. Thorner,
                            who was naturalized on April 4, 1887, in the city court of Birmingham,
                            Ala., and who received a passport, No. 219, dated January 14, 1890, from
                            the legation of the United States at Berlin for himself, wife, and minor
                            son, Eugene Guido, then 3½ months old.</p>
                        <p>It appears from Mr. Thorner’s statement that the son was born in Germany
                            while his parents were on a temporary visit there, and that notice of
                            the birth was given to the legation at Berlin, which’ failed to make
                            record of it. He contemplates sending this son to Germany for the
                            purpose of study, and fears that by reason of his own birth and that of
                            his son in Germany the lad will, upon reaching the military age, be
                            called upon for service. He therefore desires that the American
                            citizenship of his son be recognized by the German Government.</p>
                        <p>There is no doubt that the boy is an American citizen under section 1993
                            of the Revised Statutes, and is entitled to all the protection this
                            Government can give him as such. The Department will be pleased,
                            therefore, to have you do what you can to have his American citizenship
                            recognized by the German Government.</p>

                            14, 1901, intervention was made in behalf of Eugene Guido Thorner, to

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to invite attention to
                            the case of one Paul N. Friedlaender, a naturalized American citizen of
                            German origin, and to request that such instructions may be given in
                            regard thereto as may be found appropriate.</p>
                        <p>Friedlaender was naturalized at Chicago, on May 28, 1897, after having
                            resided in the United States for a full term of five years. He had had
                            permission to emigrate from Germany and had regularly renewed his German
                            passport until the time of his becoming an American citizen. His mother,
                            who lives at Potsdam, near Berlin, was called upon about a year ago to
                            pay a fine on his account—for being absent without permission—and she
                            had become involved in correspondence with the local authorities. In
                            March, 1901, Friedlaender applied to the embassy for its assistance, and
                            on the 23d of that month a note (F. O. No. 918) was addressed to the
                            foreign office asking that such steps might be taken as were “necessary
                            to effect the return to Friedlaender of his American papers, the
                            refunding of any money which may have already been paid on account of
                            his failure to report for military service, the cessation of all
                            proceedings against him which may have been taken on the same account,
                            and his recognition as an American citizen.”</p>
                        <p>To this note the foreign office replied, under date of June 12, returning
                            Friedlaender’s naturalization certificate and certain other papers, and
                            stating that he had been sentenced to pay a fine of 30 marks or to
                            undergo imprisonment for ten days by a local court, on April 10, 1900,
                            on account of his “unauthorized emigration,” but that Friedlaender had
                            not yet paid the fine and costs and as he was in America there was no
                            necessity, at present, to take steps looking toward his pardon.</p>
                        <p>The embassy at once replied (F. O. No. 969) that Friedlaender expected to
                            return to Germany upon a visit during the present year, and requested
                            that such steps might be taken as were necessary to set aside the
                            sentence against him.</p>
                        <p>Under date of June 28, the foreign office addressed another note to <pb
                                n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0261"/>the embassy, advising that
                            Friedlaender petition the Emperor directly in order that the judgment
                            against him might be set aside before his return to Germany, and
                            suggesting that, in order to expedite matters, the embassy should
                            support such a petition when made.</p>
                        <p>To this note the embassy replied at once (F. O. No. 987) requesting a
                            reconsideration of the case, as Friedlaender’s offense was merely
                            emigration without permission, and not desertion, and as “under the
                            circumstances, in the opinion of the embassy and in accordance with
                            precedent, the case falls within the provisions of the treaty of 1868,
                            and the two Prussian ministerial decrees of July of that year, copies of
                            which are transmitted herewith. As the Prussian ministry of justice has
                            decreed that ‘die durch strafbare Auswanderung verwirkte Strafe * * *
                            nicht zur Vollstreckung gebracht werden soil,’ there would appear to be
                            no reason for Friedlaender’s making a formal petition for pardon.”</p>
                        <p>To this note the foreign office has now replied, under date of the 8th
                            instant, that the ministerial decrees referred to above presupposed the
                            actual return to Germany of the person in question, that it was probable
                            that Friedlaender’s fine would be remitted by an act of clemency, and
                            that it would be advisable for him to send in a petition to the Emperor
                            before coming to Germany, as if he did not do so he might be called upon
                            to pay the fine and take the consequences.</p>
                        <p>The embassy will make no reply to this note for the present. The foreign
                            office’s advice has, however, been communicated to Friedlander, who has
                            been informed that while the embassy holds that he is entitled to visit
                            Germany without molestation under the terms of the treaty itself, and
                            that no pardon is necessary, it might enable him to avoid possible
                            trouble if he acted upon this advice. He has been requested to inform
                            the embassy with regard to his decision and his movements in the event
                            of his coming to Germany.</p>
                        <p>Without instructions, however, the embassy would not feel at liberty to
                            give support to any petition which Friedlaender may determine to send
                            in, as by so doing it might be considered that the embassy admitted the
                            correctness of the position now taken by the foreign office. If it is
                            necessary for Friedlaender to send in a petition in order to secure such
                            rights as would appear to be his under the treaty, there is no reason
                            why the same course should not be followed by every American citizen of
                            German origin who desires to visit his former home, and this, under
                            existing circumstances, the embassy is not prepared to admit.</p>

                            foreign office asking the refunding of any money already paid on account
                            of his failure to <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0262"/>report for
                            military service and the cessation of all proceedings against him which
                            may have been taken on the same account and his recognition as an
                            American citizen.</p>
                        <p>In the second paragraph on the first page of your dispatch you state that
                            Friedlaender had permission to emigrate from Germany, while in the
                            fourth paragraph of the second page you state that “his offense was
                            merely emigration without permission.” You further state that
                            Friedlaender had been sentenced to pay a fine or suffer imprisonment by
                            the judgment of a local court April 10, 1900, on account of his
                            unauthorized emigration; that the German foreign office has advised that
                            Friedlaender petition the Emperor directly for a vacation of the
                            judgment or remission of the penalty, and suggested that in order to
                            expedite matters his petition be supported by the embassy, which the
                            latter declined to do for the reason that the case is governed by the
                            naturalization treaty of 1868 and by the two ministerial decrees of July
                            of that year, and that since the Prussian minister of justice has
                            decreed that as the penalty for punishable emigration is not to be
                            executed there would appear to be no reason for a formal petition of
                            pardon.</p>
                        <p>To this the foreign office replied, advising that Friedlaender send in a
                            petition before coming to Germany, as otherwise a demand for payment
                            will be made upon him and difficulties for him will arise therefrom, as
                            then the remission of the penalty will not at that time have been
                            introduced in the official way.</p>
                        <p>You express doubt whether you should give support to any petition by
                            Friedlaender, as by so doing it might be construed as an admission of
                            the correctness of the position taken by the foreign office, rendering
                            it necessary to pursue the same course in respect of every American
                            citizen of German origin desiring to visit his former home.</p>

                        <p>The circular of the minister of justice, dated July 5, 1868, states that

                            of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>The circular of the minister of the interior, dated July 6, 1868, states
                            that it was the prevailing intention of the treaty that in conformity
                            with Article II of the treaty the punishable action committed by the
                            unauthorized emigration of a citizen of the confederation to the United
                            States of America should not be made the ground for a penal prosecution
                                <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0263"/>upon the return of such
                            person to his former country after absence of not less than five years,
                            and that the punishment for such action, even though already legally
                            declared, should not be consummated if the person has acquired in
                            America the right of citizenship in conformity with Article I of said
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>A State has the unquestionable legal right to regulate under penalties
                            either the emigration of its subjects or the immigration of aliens, as
                            also to punish its nationals for failure to report for military service,
                            except so far as restrained by treaty (1 Rivier, 269; 2 Wharton, sec.
                            171).</p>
                        <p>A State does not, however, necessarily take official notice of the
                            naturalization of its subjects as citizens of another State.
                            Consequently, in the absence of such official knowledge, it may, if
                            authorized to do so by its own laws, proceed against them by judicial
                            trial and condemnation, even in their absence. With such treatment by it
                            of its own subjects no other State has any concern.</p>
                        <p>As the case is stated, Friedlaender was a native-born German subject and
                            appears to have been condemned as for punishable emigration. If he had
                            received permission to emigrate, the judgment was not unlawful, though
                            erroneous in point of fact, unless the fact was shown at the trial; if
                            he had not received such permission, it was not unlawful unless at the
                            trial proof was submitted showing his naturalization in the United
                            States and his compliance with the terms of the treaty. As the case is
                            stated, it does not appear that the judgment was unlawfully rendered,
                            although erroneous. And as the German court or Government would not know
                            this error without evidence of the facts which brought Friedlaender
                            within the exemption of the treaty, it is entirely proper that he should
                            take steps before the court to have the judgment vacated and set aside,
                            on proof of the facts which would have constituted a good defense of the
                            action if they had been presented at the trial, or that he should
                            petition the Emperor to vacate the judgment, submitting the facts and
                            proofs necessary to show that the judgment was in fact given in”
                            violation of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>While this may result in some inconvenience in practice, it is the course
                            pursued in the United States in analogous cases. If a judgment by
                            default has been rendered against a person during his absence, provision
                            is usually made for his application to the court, within a given period,
                            to have the judgment set aside for error of law or fact. If a person has
                            been condemned as a criminal, he may have judicial proceedings to
                            correct an erroneous conviction, and in the last instance may appeal to
                            the Executive to grant a pardon.</p>
                        <p>The advice of the German foreign office that an appeal be made to the
                            Emperor to set aside the judgment on the grounds stated in your
                            dispatch, so far from involving a concession that the conviction was not
                            erroneous in fact, may be accepted in the sense that it was erroneous
                            because rendered in violation of the treaty, as authentically
                            interpreted in the circulars. A pardon would be inappropriate as
                            implying a guilt which is shown not to exist in fact, yet if this is the
                            only way the Emperor can lawfully proceed, the proceeding should be
                            accompanied by you with this interpretation.</p>
                        <p>The better course in all such cases is for the naturalized American to
                            have proceedings instituted in the proper court to vacate the judgment,
                            if such remedy is given by the local laws; and in all cases if they have
                            notice they should make defense by counsel if allowable to <pb n="184"
                                xml:id="pg_184" facs="0264"/>suits of that character while pending.
                            They should not burden the embassy by asking it to relieve them from the
                            consequences of their own neglect to defend; but it is, of course,
                            proper for you to render them all necessary assistance, even when they
                            could have avoided trouble by timely attention to their own
                            interests.</p>

                            am of the opinion that it would be advantageous to have more modern
                            ships visit German ports. During “regatta week” at Kiel there is usually
                            quite an assemblage of German naval vessels in port, as well as a more
                            or less international (principally English) gathering of pleasure and
                            racing yachts. It is the known desire of the German Emperor to increase
                            the international character of the regatta, and I feel confident that
                            the presence of American vessels during the week would be favorably
                            regarded. In view of the recent reestablishment by us of an “European
                            squadron,” I venture to hope that this question may receive proper
                            consideration. <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0265"/>Many German
                            naval officers have been in United States ports, have experienced
                            American hospitality, speak English, and have pleasant recollections of
                            their association with our service and its officers, while relatively
                            few of our officers have any knowledge of German or anything more than a
                            superficial (or literary) acquaintance with German officers and the
                            Imperial Navy. As a former officer in our Navy, I have given this
                            subject considerable serious consideration, and I am decidedly of the
                            opinion that more intercourse between American and German naval officers
                            in ports where there is no outside influence can not but be
                            beneficial.</p>

                            it, gave prominence to the President’s message of sympathy, frequently
                            adding expressions of thorough appreciation of its spirit and whole
                            tenor.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that it has
                            been officially announced that the German Emperor received Prince Tschun
                            Tsai-fong, a brother of the Emperor of China, at Potsdam at noon
                            yesterday, and that Prince Tschun made a speech in which he expressed
                            the regret of the Emperor of China at the murder of the German minister
                            in Pekin, Baron Clemens von Ketteler, last year. The German Emperor
                            received from Prince Tschun a letter from the Emperor of China, and made
                            a reply to the speech. A translation of the speeches and of the letter
                            is appended hereto, their text having been published in the official
                            part of last night’s Imperial Gazette (No. 210).</p>
                        <p>Prince Tschun arrived in Potsdam on September 3 and was lodged in one of
                            the royal palaces. Yesterday morning, in carriages provided by the royal
                            stables, but without any escort, he proceeded to the “New Palace,”
                            where, accompanied by the new Chinese minister as interpreter, he was
                            received by the Emperor, who was surrounded by several German princes,
                            Baron von Richthofen, the Imperial secretary of state for foreign
                            affairs, and various high court, civil, and military officials.</p>
                        <p>On leaving the palace Prince Tschun was greeted with the military honors
                            usually shown to an Imperial prince, and a military escort accompanied
                            him to his residence. It is understood that, expiation having now been
                            made, he will be shown the usual courtesies as long as he remains the
                            guest of the Emperor—for a day or two.</p>
                        <p>The new Chinese minister has not yet been received as such, and
                            diplomatic relations have not yet been fully resumed, no audience having
                            been granted the departing minister to present his letters of
                            recall.</p>
                        <p>I have deemed it advisable to make this report, in view of the fact that
                            the sending of this “expiatory mission” was the result of the <pb
                                n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0268"/>combined action of the several
                            foreign representatives in Pekin, and because of the attention which has
                            been given to it by the press generally and of the irresponsible reports
                            which have been made with regard to the manner in which Prince Tschun
                            was to have been received, and the reasons for his not having come
                            through from Basle to Berlin about the 26th ultimo.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="italic">Berlin, Wednesday.</hi>—The letter from the Emperor
                                of China, handed to the Emperor William by Prince Tschun, is to the
                                following effect:</p>
                            <p>“The Great Emperor of the Chinese Empire to His Majesty the Great
                                German Emperor, greeting.</p>
                            <p>“Ever since the Empires have been mutually represented by permanent
                                legations we have stood in uninterrupted friendly relationship
                                toward one another. These relations became still closer when Prince
                                Henry of Prussia came to Pekin, for on that occasion we had the
                                privilege of receiving the Prince frequently and of being able to
                                hold intercourse with him in an intimate manner. Unfortunately, in
                                the fifth month of last year, the Boxers rebelliously penetrated
                                into Pekin and the soldiers joined them.</p>
                            <p>“The result was the murder of Your Majesty’s minister, Baron von
                                Ketteler, a man who, so long as he occupied his post in Pekin, paid
                                careful attention to the interests of our countries and to whom we
                                were bound to pay our special acknowledgments. We regret most deeply
                                that Baron von Ketteler met so terrible an end among us. The fact
                                that we were not in a position to take due protective measures was
                                painful to our feeling of responsibility. It was our feeling of
                                responsibility which prompted us to erect a monument on the spot as
                                a sign that the crime should not remain unexpiated.</p>
                            <p>“Further, we have sent to Germany with this letter, the Imperial
                                Prince Tschun Tsai-fong, at the head of a special mission. Prince
                                Tschun, who is our own brother, will assure Your Majesty how deeply
                                the events of the past year have grieved us and how deeply the
                                feeling of penitence and shame still animate us. Your Majesty sent
                                your troops from a far distance to put down the Boxer rebellion and
                                restore peace and the welfare of our nation. We have, therefore,
                                commanded Prince Tschun to express personally to Your Majesty our
                                thanks for your efforts in promoting peace.</p>
                            <p>“We cherish the hope that Your Majesty’s indignation has given place
                                to the old feelings of friendship. That the relations between our
                                Empires may be of an even more extensive, intimate, and beneficial
                                character than hitherto is our firm assurance.”</p>
                            <p>Prince Tschun, in delivering the letter, spoke in the following
                                terms:</p>
                            <p>“By order of the Great Emperor, my most gracious lord and master, I
                                have the honor to deliver His Majesty’s letter into Your Majesty’s
                                Imperial hands. After the rebellious movement in China in the past
                                year, the Imperial court felt spontaneously no less than on the
                                demand of the powers the obligation of expressing, by a special
                                mission, its sincere regret at these events, and especially in the
                                case of which Your Majesty’s excellent minister, Baron von Ketteler,
                                fell a victim.</p>
                            <p>“In order to place the sincerity of this regret beyond all doubt His
                                Majesty the Emperor designated a very near blood relation for the
                                mission. I am in a position to assure Your Majesty that the Emperor,
                                my most gracious master, stood aloof from these complications, which
                                brought the great misfortune upon China and loss and care upon
                                Germany, in the fullest sense of the words. Nevertheless, in
                                accordance with customs existing for thousands of years, the Emperor
                                of China has taken the blame for it upon his own sacred person. I
                                have, therefore, the task of expressing to Your Majesty the most
                                cordial feelings of the Emperor, my illustrious master, toward Your
                                Majesty. In handing to you this letter, I am also charged to be the
                                interpreter of this feeling of the Great Emperor of China toward Her
                                Majesty the Empress, and the whole of the Imperial family, and to
                                express the wish that Your Majesty’s house may flourish and enjoy
                                health, happiness, and blessings in the fullest measure. His Majesty
                                the Emperor of China hopes that the events of the past year were
                                only a passing shadow, and that after the clouds have dispersed, the
                                brightness <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0269"/>of peace between
                                the two nations of Germany and China may teach them mutually ever to
                                understand and value one another better. This is also my most
                                sincere wish.”</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">the emperor’s reply.</hi></p>
                            <p>The Emperor then addressed the following reply to Prince Tschun:</p>
                            <p>“This is not a joyous or festive occasion, or the fulfillment of a
                                simple act of courtesy, which has brought your imperial highness to
                                me, but a deeply melancholy and very serious event. My minister at
                                the court of the Emperor of China, Baron von Ketteler, has been
                                slain in the capital of China by the murderous weapon of an Imperial
                                Chinese soldier, lifted against him by superior command, an
                                unheard-of crime, which is branded by international law and the
                                usage of all nations alike. From the mouth of your imperial highness
                                I have just received the expression of the deep regret of the
                                Emperor of China.</p>
                            <p>“Concerning this event I readily believe that your imperial highness’
                                imperial brother personally stood aloof from the crime and the
                                subsequent acts of violence against the inviolable legations and
                                peaceful foreigners. All the greater is the guilt which falls upon
                                his adviser and his government. These must not delude themselves
                                into believing that by an expiatory mission alone they will have
                                made atonement and obtained pardon for their guilt. This can only be
                                done by their future attitude in conformity with the prescriptions
                                of international law and the usages of civilized nations. If the
                                Emperor of China conducts the government of his great Empire
                                henceforth strictly in the spirit of these prescriptions, then will
                                his hope be fulfilled that the sad results of the complications of
                                the past year will be overcome, and that between Germany and China,
                                as formerly, lasting peaceful and friendly relations will again
                                prevail and conduce to the benefit of two nations and the whole of
                                human civilization. In the sincere and earnest wish that this may be
                                so, I bid your imperial highness welcome.”</p>

                            I hasten to express the deepest and most heartfelt sympathy of the
                            German nation. Germany mourns with America for her noble son who lost
                            his life whilst he was fulfilling his duty to his country and his
                            people.</p>

                            port of Emden has now been opened without any great formality. It is
                            announced in last night’s Reichs-Anzeiger that this port can now
                            accommodate the largest seagoing ships. The inner harbor (Binnenhafen)
                            has everywhere a depth of more than 6 meters, while the depth of the
                            outer harbor at mean high water is more than 11 meters, so that it can
                            accommodate ships drawing 8.2 meters at all times. The harbor will be
                            kept open in winter, and the channel of the Ems, from Emden to the sea,
                            is to be made 10 meters deep. Quays have been built in the outer harbor,
                            and electric cranes, coaling chutes, etc., have been provided. The outer
                            harbor is a free harbor, and provision has been made for the loading and
                            unloading of goods, and for storage, with comparatively little
                            supervision by the customs authorities.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As the Department is aware, efforts have
                            repeatedly been made to direct the flow of German emigration away from
                            North America, the United States, and Canada, toward the German colonies
                            and South America. It is claimed that in North America the emigrant is
                            too readily absorbed and that he loses his political and economic
                            nationality in a very short time, while in the colonies he remains a
                            German in every sense, and in South America he still retains, to a
                            considerable extent at least, his German tastes and habits. In short,
                            the emigrant to North America is lost to Germany entirely, while those
                            who go to South America, although they may lose their political
                            nationality, continue to be purchasers in the German markets. It will be
                            remembered that arguments of this character were used in advocating the
                            passage of an emigration law in 1897.</p>
                        <p>Germany is at present suffering from industrial depression, the eventual
                            result of which can not but be healthy, and the immediate effect of this
                            is almost certain to be increased emigration in the near future. The
                            condition is such that the president of the Prussian ministry (Count
                            Bülow) has thought it wise to instruct the provincial governors to
                            collect information with regard to the numbers of the unemployed and to
                            suggest measures by which aid can be given.</p>
                        <p>The Colonial Society, however, has determined to endeavor to direct the
                            emigration which it considers inevitable, and to that end it has made a
                            provisional arrangement with the Imperial Government for the
                            establishment of an information bureau for emigrants. This bureau is to
                            be under the supervision of the chancellor of the Empire, although its
                            character will not be strictly official, and information is to be
                            furnished by it gratuitously to intending emigrants, directly or through
                            agents. The Government is to bear a part of the expenses connected with
                            this work, and is to furnish to the bureau such information as may be
                            received from its representatives abroad as may be of interest to those
                            wishing to make a home outside the limits of the Empire proper. The
                            avowed object of this enterprise is “to prevent the dissipation of the
                            energy, nationality, and capital which German emigrants take out of the
                            Empire, uselessly throughout the world, and the economic fertilization
                            of foreign countries, and to so direct German emigration that it may
                            remain German, nationally and economically, to the greatest possible
                            extent.”</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that,
                            immediately after my recent return to Berlin, I included in the usual
                            notification to the foreign office a request for an audience with the
                            Emperor, in order to make <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0272"/>known
                            to him the special message of good will which the President had
                            personally instructed me to convey.</p>
                        <p>As a result, I was invited to dine last evening with their majesties at
                            Potsdam, audience being previously given me.</p>
                        <p>Having heard the message from the President expressing his hearty good
                            feeling toward the Monarch and his Empire, His Majesty responded very
                            cordially, declaring that he fully reciprocated the feeling the
                            President had expressed, and referring to the President’s career and
                            character in terms which showed that he had studied both with care and
                            highly appreciated them. He also referred to the recent elections in New
                            York City and elsewhere, as proving that the President’s courage and
                            intelligent earnestness had given a strong impulse to men of like
                            character throughout the country, and among these he especially named,
                            with admiration, Mr. Seth Low.</p>
                        <p>In this, as well as in the conversation at table and afterwards, the
                            Emperor dwelt upon the wonderful progress made by the United States in
                            sundry great enterprises and industries and especially in shipbuilding,
                            discussing this and kindred subjects with remarkable thoroughness and
                            knowledge of detail. He referred to the fact that he had sent suitable
                            persons to the United States to study our canal systems and internal
                            waterways generally. He also expressed his pleasure at the honor done
                            the imperial ambassador, Dr. Von Hollenben, by Harvard University, and
                            said that, in recognition of this courtesy, he had ordered a collection
                            of casts of the more curious and interesting sculptures and works of art
                            from various public monuments and collections within the Empire to be
                            especially prepared and sent to the Germanic Museum at that
                            institution.</p>
                        <p>Both at the audience and in the conversation afterwards, the Emperor
                            showed that he was realty pleased with the message which the President
                            had sent him, both with its assurances of a political nature and with
                            its more personal and special details.</p>

                        <p>Against the Venezuelan Government there is a claim pending of the Berlin
                            Company of Discount (Berliner Disconto Gesellschaft) on account of the
                            nonperformance of engagements which the Venezuelan <pb n="193"
                                xml:id="pg_193" facs="0273"/>Government has undertaken in connection
                            with the great Venezuelan Railway which has been built by the said
                            Government. Those obligations amount for the time being to fully
                            6,000,000 bolivares (1 bolivar to be counted as 80 pfennige). The
                            obligations continue to increase, as the interest for the values of the
                            5 per cent Venezuelan loan of the year 1896, which was emitted to the
                            amount of 33,000,000 bolivares and which have been transmitted to the
                            company as a guaranty for the payment of interest of the capital spent
                            in building, has not been paid regularly since seven years, nor has the
                            payment been made regularly to the sinking fund.</p>
                        <p>This behavior of the Venezuelan Government could, perhaps, to a certain
                            degree be explained and be excused by the bad situation of the finances
                            of the State; but our further reclamations against Venezuela, which date
                            from the Venezuelan civil wars of the years 1898 until 1900, have taken
                            during those last months a more serious character. Through those wars
                            many German merchants living in Venezuela and many German landowners
                            have been seriously damaged, as partly compulsory loans have been
                            extorted from them, partly requisites of war which have been found in
                            their possession, as especially the cattle necessary for the feeding of
                            the troops have been taken from them without being paid for, partly
                            their houses and grounds have been ransacked or devastated. The amount
                            of these damages comes to fully 2,000,000 bolivares. This amount is to
                            be divided between 35 claimants, who are partly poor people. Several of
                            the damaged have lost nearly all their possessions, and through this
                            their creditors who live in Germany have suffered likewise. Very likely
                            these reclamations will be presently put before the Reichstag.</p>
                        <p>Evidently the Venezuelan Government, if we judge it after its behavior in
                            the present, is not willing to fulfill its engagements in compensating
                            these damages. After having first fixed a six-monthly term during which
                            the Government refused to discuss any claims for compensation, the
                            Government issued in January last a decree stating that a commission
                            consisting solely of Venezuelan officials should decide about the
                            claims, which the damaged would have to bring to their knowledge during
                            three months. The proceedings as settled by this decree seem in three
                            articles not to be acceptable. First of all, that all the claims for
                            damage which came from the time before the 23d of May, 1899 (that means
                            before the appointment of the present President of the Republic,
                            Castro), should not be considered, while of course the government of
                            Castro is, as all other governments, responsible for the deeds of its
                            predecessors. Another article said that all diplomatic protestations
                            against decisions of the commission should be excluded and only the
                            appeal to the supreme Venezuelan court of justice should be admitted.
                            The members of this court are entirely dependent on the Government and
                            have frequently been simply dismissed by the President. Finally, the
                            Government wanted to pay for the claims which should be recognized by
                            the commission only with bonds of a newly to be emitted revolution debt,
                            which would be, after the experiences made, up till present without any
                            value.</p>
                        <p>The behavior of the Venezuelan Government must therefore be considered as
                            a frivolous attempt to avoid just obligations. As was to be expected,
                            several of the few German claims put before the commission have been
                            simply rejected and others have been reduced in a decidedly malicious
                            way. So, by example, a German cattle breeder, from whom <pb n="194"
                                xml:id="pg_194" facs="0274"/>fully 3,800 head of cattle, to the
                            value of more than 600,000 bolivares, had been forcibly taken away, got
                            only 15,000 bolivares adjudicated. But the Government has not paid for
                            the claims recognized as just by the commission, but has told the
                            damaged that a bill in their interest would be submitted to the next
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>The German Government has first tried to induce the Government of Caracas
                            to change their decree in the mentioned three articles. After this
                            expedient had been rejected, it has been by order of the Imperial
                            Government firmly declared to the Venezuelan Government that we are
                            forced under the present circumstances to refuse altogether our
                            acknowledgment of the decree. Similar declarations have been delivered
                            by the predominant majority of the other interested powers, especially
                            of the United States of America, whose reclamations from the Venezuelan
                            civil wars come to fully 1,000,000 bolivares. The Venezuelan Government
                            claims against those declarations that it is not able to treat the
                            foreigners in a different way from the Venezuelan citizens, and that the
                            Government regarded, therefore, the settlement of the reclamations in
                            question as an internal affair of the country in which no foreign power
                            could meddle without injuring the sovereignty of the country. Another
                            attempt to change the mind of the Government has been likewise
                            unsuccessful. The Government has declared in its reply that it had to
                            repel all diplomatic interference in this matter and that the claimants,
                            as the term fixed in the decree had meanwhile passed, had to be
                            exclusively referred to the supreme Venezuelan court of justice.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances the Imperial Government believes that further
                            negotiations with Venezuela on the present base are hopeless. The
                            Imperial Government proposes therefore to submit the reclamations in
                            question, which have been carefully studied and have been considered as
                            well founded, directly to the Venezuelan Government and to ask for their
                            settlement. If the Venezuelan Government continues to decline as before,
                            it would have to be considered what measures of coercion should be used
                            against it.</p>
                        <p>But we consider it of importance to let first of all the Government of
                            the United States know about our purposes so that we can prove that we
                            have nothing else in view than to help those of our citizens who have
                            suffered damages, and we shall first take into consideration only the
                            claims of those German citizens who have suffered in the civil war.</p>
                        <p>We declare especially that under no circumstances do we consider in our
                            proceedings the acquisition or the permanent occupation of Venezuelan
                            territory. If the Venezuelan Government should force us to the
                            application of measures of coercion, we should have to consider
                            furthermore if at this occasion we should ask likewise for a greater
                            security for the fulfillment of the claims of the Company of Discount of
                            Berlin.</p>
                        <p>After the posing of an ultimatum, first of all the blockade of the more
                            important Venezuelan harbors—that is, principally the harbors of La
                            Guayra’a and Porto Cabello—would have to be considered as an appropriate
                            measure of coercion, as the levying of duties for import and export
                            being nearly the only source of income of Venezuela would in this way be
                            made impossible. Likewise it would be difficult in this way to provide
                            the country, which depends on the import of corn, with food. If this
                            measure does not seem efficient, we would have to consider the temporary
                            occupation on our part of different Venezuelan harbor places and the
                            levying of duties in those places.</p>

                            <p>The President in his message of the 3d of December, 1901, used the
                                following language: “The Monroe doctrine is a declaration that there
                                must be no territorial aggrandizement by any non-American power at
                                the expense of any American power on American soil. It is in no wise
                                intended as hostile to any nation in the Old World.” The President
                                further said: “This doctrine has nothing to do with the commercial
                                relations of any American power, save that it in truth allows each
                                of them to form such as it desires. * * * We do not guarantee any
                                State against punishment if it misconducts itself, provided that
                                punishment does not take the form of the acquisition of territory by
                                any non-American power.”</p>
                            <p>His excellency the German ambassador, on his recent return from
                                Berlin, conveyed personally to the President the assurance of the
                                German Emperor that His, Majesty’s Government had no purpose or
                                intention to make even the smallest acquisition of territory on the
                                South American Continent or the islands adjacent. This voluntary and
                                friendly declaration was afterwards repeated to the Secretary of
                                State, and was received by the President and the people of the
                                United States in the frank and cordial spirit in which it was
                                offered. In the memorandum of the 11th of December, his excellency
                                the German ambassador repeats these assurances as follows: “We
                                declare especially that under no circumstances do we consider in our
                                proceedings the acquisition or the permanent occupation of
                                Venezuelan territory.”</p>
                            <p>In the said memorandum of the 11th of December, the German Government
                                informs that of the United States that it has certain just claims
                                for money and for damages wrongfully withheld from German subjects
                                by the Government of Venezuela, and that it proposes to take certain
                                coercive measures described in the memorandum to enforce the payment
                                of these just claims.</p>
                            <p>The President of the United States, appreciating the courtesy of the
                                German Government in making him acquainted with the state of affairs
                                referred to, and not regarding himself as called upon to enter into
                                the consideration of the claims in question, believes that no
                                measures will be taken in this matter by the agents of the German
                                Government which are not in accordance with the well-known purpose,
                                above set forth, of His Majesty the German Emperor.</p>

                        <p>In case the German Government should be obliged to use coercion against
                            Venezuela in connection with the pending claims, it will have to be
                            considered what kind of measures should be applied.</p>
                        <p>The most important measure of coercion—that is, the blockade of
                            Venezuelan harbors—would have to be carried through without a
                            declaration of war preceding it. The blockade would therefore be a peace
                            blockade. Such a blockade would touch likewise the ships of neutral
                            powers, inasmuch as such ships, although a confiscation of them would
                            not have to be considered, would have to be turned away and prohibited
                            until the blockade should be raised. In the same manner European States
                            have proceeded on such occasions, especially England and France.</p>

                        <p>The assassination of President McKinley, together with the anarchistic
                            crimes and attempts upon the lives of chief magistrates committed in
                            recent years, have rendered it terribly evident that a struggle against
                            the menace of anarchy is an urgent necessity for all governments and a
                            duty whose performance can not be postponed.</p>
                        <p>It is evident that concerted action on the part of the governments
                            interested can not be really successful unless the uniform and strict
                            enforcement of the measures that may be adopted against the anarchists
                            can be secured by an international understanding. It would be
                            preferable, it seems, to attain that end by an exchange of views among
                            the governments rather than by convoking a new conference.</p>
                        <p>The Imperial Government of Germany and the Imperial Government of Russia
                            have consequently agreed to propose such common action to the powers as
                            will tend to the adoption of uniform measures in order to check the
                            anarchistic movement.</p>
                        <p>The resolutions of the conference held at Rome in 1898, only a very small
                            part of which has been put in practice, might serve as a basis for the
                            projected understanding. It would be desirable that the governments,
                            agreeably to the decisions of that conference, should agree to adopt
                            uniform administrative measures having for their object the
                            establishment of a rigorous surveillance of the anarchists by the
                            creation of central bureaus in the various countries, by the exchange of
                            information, and by international regulations relative to the expulsion
                            of anarchists from all countries of which they are not subjects. The
                            projected understanding should, so far as this may be possible, not
                            confine itself to the measures above referred to, but should comprise
                            various legislative measures tending to strengthen and complete the
                            provisions of the penal code against the anarchists, against the
                            combined effects of their common action, and against the subversive
                            press. It would, <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0277"/>furthermore,
                            be well to introduce into legislation a more complete and precise
                            definition of anarchistic crime in all its aspects.</p>
                        <p>The governments of Germany and Russia express the hope that the United
                            States Government will not refuse to recognize the necessity of
                            energetically resisting the development of the anarchistic movement. The
                            representatives of the two governments, therefore, beg the United States
                            Government to inform them as speedily as possible whether it is disposed
                            in principle to cooperate with the German and Russian governments in
                            establishing an exchange of views that may lead to common action based,
                            either in whole or in part, upon the propositions set forth.</p>
                        <p>In case of an affirmative reply, the details regarding the enforcing of
                            the measures in question might be subsequently elaborated.</p>

                                Humbert of Italy perpetrate a crime, and the law should insure their
                                rigorous punishment. They and those like them should be kept out of
                                this country; and if found here they should be promptly deported to
                                the country whence they came, and far-reaching provision should be
                                made for the punishment of those who stay. No matter calls more
                                urgently for the wisest thought of the Congress.”</p>
                            <p>The President further recommended that “The Federal courts should be
                                given jurisdiction over any man who kills or attempts to kill the
                                President or any man who by the Constitution or by law is in line of
                                succession for the Presidency, while the punishment for an
                                unsuccessful attempt should be proportioned to the enormity of the
                                offense against our institutions.” He also recommended that anarchy
                                    <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0278"/>should be declared an
                                offense against the law of nations through treaties among all
                                civilized powers.</p>
                            <p>These extracts from the President’s message, it is believed, will
                                assure all governments of civilized peoples of the President’s
                                earnest desire to adopt every practicable means to eradicate this
                                deadly growth from our body politic. The President will be glad to
                                adopt such administrative measures as are within his constitutional
                                power to cooperate with other governments to this end.</p>
                            <p>So far as concerns the legislative action which may be necessary, the
                                large number of bills which have been introduced in both Houses of
                                Congress during the present session sufficiently show the trend of
                                public sentiment in the same direction. The President will take all
                                proper means to urge upon Congress the adoption of such measures for
                                the suppression of anarchy as may be found acceptable to the
                                National Legislature and which may enable the Executive to act in
                                the matter with greater effectiveness in concert with other
                                powers.</p>

                        <p>Cases have recently occurred in which British merchant vessels arriving
                            at Boston from the Philippine Islands bring Filipinos as seamen on
                            board, properly signed on the articles. These men, on arrival at Boston,
                            ask for their discharge, as they claim to be United States citizens, and
                            as such they can be discharged with the sanction of the British consul.
                            But if they are not considered United States citizens, consular sanction
                            to their discharge would have to be refused.</p>
                        <p>The customs authorities at Boston hold that the Filipinos in question are
                            not entitled to claim American citizenship.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned would be glad to be made acquainted with the view of the
                            State Department with regard to this point, which appears to be dealt
                            with by Article IX of the treaty of peace between the United States and
                            Spain, signed at Paris December 10, 1898.</p>

                        <p>With reference to the request contained in the memorandum of the British
                            embassy of May 26 last, for an expression of the views of this
                            Government upon the matter of the citizenship of Filipinos, intended for
                            the guidance of British consuls at ports of the United States in
                            determination of the question whether they may or may not discharge
                            Filipinos who, serving as seamen on British merchant vessels, ask to be
                            discharged at United States ports before the voyage for which they have
                            signed articles has terminated, the Attorney-General, to whom the
                            subject has been referred, writes, under date of July 12, that the
                            question is not to be lightly determined. A man may be a citizen in one
                            sense of the word, or from certain points of view, or for certain
                            purposes, yet not in every sense nor for all purposes.</p>
                        <p>He asks to be informed more definitely what the facts in the cases which
                            have arisen may be, and in what manner the question of citizenship
                            presented itself, believing that he would thereafter be better able to
                            pass upon the subject.</p>

                        <p>With reference to the memorandum of the State Department of July 19,
                            relative to the question of the citizenship of Filipinos who, serving as
                            seamen on board British vessels, claim to be discharged at United States
                            ports before the termination of the voyage for which they have signed
                            articles, the following more definite information obtained from Her
                            Majesty’s consul-general at Boston is submitted as requested, showing in
                            greater detail how this question of citizenship has been raised.</p>
                        <p>The question first arose in May and June, 1899, when three British
                            sailing vessels arrived at Boston, having, respectively, six, ten, and
                            nine Filipinos on board, properly and legally shipped as seamen. The
                            ship’s articles in each case were not ended, nor had the men shipped to
                            be discharged at a United States port; but on arrival at Boston they all
                            desired to be paid off there.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s consul-general at first refused his sanction, as in case of
                            their becoming destitute it was not clear what Government would be
                            responsible for their relief and protection.</p>
                        <p>The seamen themselves claimed to be United States citizens and the
                            masters of the ships were of the same opinion. The difficulty in this
                            case was got over by some of the men shipping again at once, while the
                            masters agreed to become liable for the others in case of their decoming
                            destitute.</p>
                        <p>The question arose again at Boston last May, when the British ship <hi
                                rend="italic">Treasurer</hi> arrived in port with ten Filipino
                            seamen on board. They also requested to be paid off, and on consular
                            sanction being refused, they all deserted.</p>
                        <p>It is hoped that the above information will suffice for the purpose
                            mentioned in the memorandum of the State Department above referred
                            to.</p>

                        <p>With reference to the question asked in two memoranda from the British
                            embassy, dated May 26 and August 13, 1900, whether Filipinos regularly
                            shipped on British merchant vessels are regarded by the Government of
                            the United States as citizens of the United States, so that when the
                            British vessels upon which they have shipped touch at ports of the
                            United States the Filipino seamen have the right to demand to be
                            discharged although the voyage for which they have shipped may not be
                            ended, the Attorney-General, to whom the question was referred, holds,
                            in his opinion dated February 19, 1901, that seamen born in the
                            Philippine Islands “are not citizens of the United States within the
                            meaning of any statutes concerning seamen or any other statute or law of
                            the United States.”</p>

                            recently waited upon by the agent-general for New South Wales in London,
                            and the agent-general for one of the other Australian colonies, in
                            reference to the alleged operation of the United States navigation laws
                            upon Hawaiian international commerce, and especially as affecting trade
                            between Australasian and American ports in vessels not wholly owned by
                            Americans and registered in the United States of America. Their desire
                            was to obtain some relaxation of the strictness of those laws as
                            affecting such trade.</p>

                            they were aware of that, but had obtained permission from the foreign
                            office to approach me on the subject.</p>
                        <p>As the matter appeared to be of some importance, and apparently no such
                            relief as they sought could be obtained except through legislation, I
                            told them that if they would present the matter in writing I would
                            transmit it immediately to you, and had no doubt that it would receive
                            due consideration.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, the agent-general of New South Wales has now addressed to me
                            a letter on the subject, which I inclose, and shall await your
                            instructions as to any answer to be made thereto.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: At the request of the government of
                                New South Wales (whose representative I am in London), and with the
                                concurrence of the governments of the other Australian colonies
                                represented by their several agents-general, I have the honor to
                                informally approach you on the following subject, having first
                                obtained the assent of Her Majesty’s Government to the adoption of
                                this somewhat unofficial course of procedure.</p>
                            <p>The subject on which I am about to address your excellency has
                                reference to the provisions of the United States navigation laws, so
                                far as they relate to Hawaiian international commerce.</p>
                            <p>Owing to the application of the laws in question, it has become
                                impossible for any of the mail steamers trading between Australasian
                                and American ports to carry passengers and goods between the United
                                States and Honolulu, unless such steamers are wholly owned by
                                Americans and registered in the United States of America.</p>
                            <p>As that trade has hitherto represented a very valuable portion of the
                                commerce of this route, Australasian owned shipping is now placed
                                under very serious disadvantages, and in this connection I may
                                mention that the new steamship <hi rend="italic">Moana</hi>, which
                                was only recently placed on the San Francisco line by the United
                                Steamship Company <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0282"/>of New
                                Zealand, will have to be withdrawn from that service unless some
                                concession is accorded by your Government with respect to the laws
                                referred to.</p>
                            <p>Further, those laws are so stringent that produce of the United
                                States, even when for convenience of carriage is being sent to a
                                foreign port for transshipment, can not be landed at Honolulu by an
                                alien vessel, and the effect of this has been that the
                                Australian-Canadian mail steamers have lost the trade of Tacoma and
                                Seattle, the produce of those places having hitherto been sent to
                                Vancouver, British Columbia, for shipment to Honolulu.</p>
                            <p>I may mention that when Hawaii was annexed to the United States it
                                was anticipated by the Australasian colonies that at any rate an
                                interval of some years would have to “be allowed to elapse between
                                annexation and the application of the American navigation laws to
                                the Hawaiian territory.</p>
                            <p>The whole of the colonies composing the Commonwealth of Australia are
                                unanimous in their desire that the United States Government may be
                                induced to adopt such means as may be available to them for relaxing
                                these restrictions on our international trade. In New South Wales
                                the question has been raised and also debated in Parliament, while
                                the chambers of commerce and representative men have strongly urged
                                upon the Government that some action should be taken in the matter
                                as soon as possible.</p>
                            <p>As an inducement to your Government to favorably entertain this
                                question, I may point out that in addition to the commerce between
                                the United States and the other Australasian colonies (including New
                                Zeland), a large trade is being rapidly developed between your
                                country and the mother colony of New South Wales. Last year (1899),
                                9 American steamers and 60 sailing vessels from the United States
                                entered the ports of New South Wales, conveying no less than 87,000
                                tons of your goods; while, during the same period (1899), 8 American
                                steamers and 60 sailing vessels left New South Wales, conveying to
                                your ports 79,798 tons of our goods. As a further instance of this
                                rapid development it may be noted that the value of our imports from
                                your country in 1895 amounted to £624,268, whereas for last year
                                (1899) those imports had swollen to £2,219,319. On the other hand,
                                the value of our exports to your country, which in 1895 amounted to
                                £683,606, had increased to £2,392,281 in 1899. So that our total
                                trade with the United States last year amounted to £4,611,600,
                                having grown to that sum from £1,307,874 in 1895, during a period of
                                only four years.</p>
                            <p>I would further urge on your attention the fact that the greater
                                portion, if not the whole, of the American goods for which New South
                                Wales provided a profitable market, were allowed to enter our ports
                                free from the imposition of any customs duties, besides being
                                liberally treated with respect to port charges, etc., and I venture
                                to suggest that such commercial liberality on our side is entitled
                                to considerate treatment from the Government of the United States of
                                America.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, I beg therefore to ask that your excellency will be so
                                good as to make representations to the United States Government with
                                a view to such relaxation being made in the application of their
                                navigation laws as will permit of passengers and goods being
                                conveyed, as formerly, by Australasian-owned shipping between
                                American ports and Honolulu, at least for some years to come.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of your letter of November 22, 1900, inclosing a
                                communication, forwarded confidentially by our ambassador to Great
                                Britain, from Mr. Henry Copeland, general agent for New South Wales
                                at London, in which he requests of the United States “such
                                relaxation being made in the application of their navigation laws as
                                will permit of passengers and goods being conveyed, as formerly, by
                                Australasian-owned shipping between American ports and Honolulu, at
                                least for some years to come.” You request an expression of my
                                views.</p>
                            <p>In reply thereto I have the honor to state that the act to which Mr.
                                Copeland refers was passed in pursuance to the traditional policy of
                                this Government which reserves trade between American ports to
                                American vessels. The enactment of this legislation was probable
                                from the date of the annexation of Hawaii, but the interval of
                                nearly two years was allowed to elapse before that policy was
                                carried into effect by act of Congress. It was assumed that this
                                interval would be sufficient for such readjustment of shipping
                                relations as the policy of the United States would require. The
                                desire of the United States to promote friendly commercial relations
                                with the British Australasian governments has been shown by the
                                liberal appropriations of the Congress for the maintenance of an
                                ocean mail service, which has lately been improved, for the mutual
                                benefit of citizens of the United States and British Australasian
                                subjects. In the judgment of this Department it is not feasible to
                                reopen the question as Mr. Copeland suggests.</p>

                                thus preventing British owned vessels from carrying on trade between
                                these islands and the United States, is calculated to have a serious
                                effect upon the trade of the colony of New Zealand. For thirty-one
                                years the mails between England and New Zealand have been carried by
                                steamers subsidized heavily by the Government of this colony, and
                                until the 24th of October last one steamer owned by a British
                                company trading here has regularly taken part in this mail service.
                                The service has now, however, been transferred to an American owned
                                line of steamers—that of Spreckels Brothers—the United States
                                Government giving a direct subsidy of £52,000 per annum for ten
                                years. With this subsidy, added to the fact that none of the
                                steamers of this colony can trade between Hawaii and the United
                                States, it follows that the colony is completely excluded from
                                conveying either its own mails or passengers or cargo to that
                                country; and in addition to this the steamers, which are being run
                                to the prejudice and exclusion of its own vessels, operate against
                                British owned steamers trading between Australia and New Zealand, as
                                upon their trips here they will necessarily carry passengers across
                                intercolonially, and this will result most prejudicially against the
                                development of trade by its own steamers, even in its own
                                waters.</p>
                            <p>Another way in which the altered service will operate against the
                                possible introduction of an alternate service in this country is
                                this: <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0284"/>Prior to the
                                annexation of Hawaii by the United States, Honolulu was made a coal
                                depot for steamers trading under the British flag, via Vancouver to
                                these colonies, and it was the practice of the Canadian mail-ships
                                to land some 500 tons of coal at a time, which they were allowed to
                                do without port charges at Honolulu. Since the annexation of the
                                islands, however, this has not been allowed, and an impost of 3
                                shillings per ton is levied upon the coal required for steamers not
                                trading within the prescribed territory at all.</p>
                            <p>The premier, therefore, begs respectfully to request that his
                                excellency will refer the matter to the secretary of state for the
                                colonies in order that representations may be made to the United
                                States Government upon this important subject, with a view to
                                establishing a modus vivendi with the United States of a more
                                equitable character than that now existing.</p>
                            <p>As the matter is one of great importance to this colony, the premier
                                can only strongly impress upon his excellency’s attention its great
                                urgency. The subject is at present the basis of a considerable
                                amount of friction, and it is very difficult to tell how far such
                                feeling as now exists may grow.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: Referring to your recent
                            conversation, and to the confidential memorandum you left with me
                            prepared by the premier of New Zealand, touching the injurious effect on
                            the trade relations of New Zealand of excluding British owned vessels
                            from carrying on trade between the Hawaiian Islands and the United
                            States; I have the honor to say that I have fully conferred with the
                            Secretary of the Treasury on the subject.</p>
                        <p>A remedy for the difficulties complained of is not within the
                            discretionary control of the Executive, the matter being regulated by
                            legislation now in force. The act of April 30, 1900, sections 75, 98,
                            etc., relating to the Hawaiian Islands, requires that the transportation
                            of cargo from the United States to Hawaii, or vice versa, shall be
                            subject to the laws governing the coasting trade of the United States.
                            These laws practically exclude foreign vessels. British vessels may,
                            however, carry merchandise from the coast of the United States to any
                            foreign country via Hawaii, or may bring merchandise to the United
                            States from any foreign country via Hawaii. General subsidies, mail
                            compensation, etc., are given to British vessels plying between Canada
                            and Hongkong, India, Ceylon, etc., under the conditions shown in the
                            report of the Commissioner of Navigation for the year 1900, page 149, et
                            seq.</p>
                        <p>The regulation of the trade between the United States and the Hawaiian
                            Islands, in conformity with the act above referred to, seems to be in
                            accordance with the practice of other nations under analogous
                            circumstances.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In connection with the granting of
                            passports by this embassy, I have the honor to draw your attention to a
                            class of cases presenting some difficulties and involving often not a
                            little hardship to the applicants.</p>
                        <p>I refer to the applications for passports of those children of
                            naturalized citizens who were minors at the time of the naturalization
                            of their parents, and who, having been taken to America at an early age,
                            have always continued to reside there, and have subsequently performed
                            the duties attaching to full citizenship.</p>
                        <p>It would seem a hardship to such persons, when otherwise satisfactorily
                            identified, to make the production of their fathers’ naturalization
                            papers a prerequisite to obtaining a passport at this embassy, <pb
                                n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0287"/>and yet under existing
                            circumstances I have no option but to refuse unless the papers in
                            question are forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>It is constantly claimed by such applicants that this is not required of
                            them when they apply direct to the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>There are only three forms of application known to this embassy, viz,
                            “Native,” “Naturalized,” and that for “Persons claiming citizenship
                            through the naturalization of husband or parent.” It is therefore upon
                            the last form, which requires the production of parents’ naturalization
                            papers, that the applicants referred to must make their sworn
                            statements.</p>
                        <p>As far as I can discover, there is no instruction of the Department which
                            would exactly cover these circumstances.</p>
                        <p>The following recent case will perhaps make the point clearer. Charles
                            Muchnic, a young man, applied to the embassy some days ago for a
                            passport. He was the bearer of a passport from the Department of State,
                            which had just expired, and also produced proper letters of
                            identification.</p>
                        <p>From his sworn statement it appeared that he had gone to Philadelphia
                            with his father some twenty years ago, he being at the time but 3 years
                            old, and that his father was naturalized while he was still a child;
                            that ever since that time he had resided uninterruptedly in
                            Philadelphia, where he was educated and subsequently, upon arriving at
                            his majority, voted. He had recently come abroad as an engineer,
                            representing American interests, and had every intention of returning to
                            the United States to reside, as soon as he had accomplished the work he
                            was engaged upon.</p>
                        <p>A passport was refused him on the sole ground of his inability to produce
                            his father’s naturalization papers. His passport from the Department was
                            obtained in Philadelphia, where he is well known, and the production of
                            his father’s papers was not required.</p>
                        <p>I would, therefore, respectfully ask for instructions, to guide me in
                            future in such cases as that of Mr. Muchnic—as to when the production of
                            the father’s naturalization papers may be waived, or as to how far such
                            a waiver would be left to the discretion of the embassy.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department has received your No. 484,
                            of the 14th instant, concerning the proof required of those applicants
                            for passports whose parents were naturalized during their minority. You
                            suggest that hardship often arises from the requirement that they
                            produce the father’s naturalization certificate.</p>
                        <p>It is freely admitted that this requirement is often difficult to comply
                            with, but the passport bureau of the Department has frequent evidence
                            that many people come to the United States in infancy or youth, duly
                            qualify as voters when they reach their majority, exercise all the
                            rights of citizenship, and yet have no positive knowledge of their
                            parents’ naturalization, and have fallen into the error of supposing
                            that prolonged residence and unquestioned performance of a citizen’s
                            functions <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0288"/>have in fact made
                            them citizens. A person in this category is apt to express surprise and
                            even indignation at being called upon to produce his father’s
                            naturalization papers, but not infrequently investigation shows that his
                            father never had any such papers, and that he has himself been
                            performing the functions of citizenship without legal right to do
                            so.</p>
                        <p>The production of the naturalization certificate is not, however, always
                            necessary. Paragraph 154 of the Instructions to the Diplomatic Officers
                            of the United States authorizes the acceptance by a diplomatic agent
                            abroad of a passport issued by this Department as evidence of the
                            citizenship of the person in whose favor it was issued, if presented
                            before its expiration. In the case instanced in your dispatch—that of
                            Charles Muchnic, who recently applied for a passport from you and
                            produced a passport issued by this Department—there was thus no reason
                            for refusing to issue him a new passport without demanding the
                            production of his father’s naturalization certificate, unless his
                            passport had expired. An amendment to this paragraph has been submitted
                            to the President, and, if it be approved, it will be permissible to
                            accept an old passport as prima facie evidence that the applicant’s
                            citizenship was established properly when the old passport was
                            issued.</p>
                        <p>The statement that the Department does not exact the certificate of
                            naturalization is incorrect. The rule prescribed by the President
                            requires that it be produced, and in Mr. Muchnic’s case the records show
                            that he was granted a passport December 21, 1898, No. 1508, upon an
                            application duly supported by his father’s naturalization certificate
                            issued November 9, 1898, by the court of common pleas at
                            Philadelphia.</p>
                        <p>It is not intended that secondary proof may not on rare occasions be
                            accepted in lieu of the naturalization certificate. The question is
                            fully discussed in the Department’s publication, The American Passport,
                            page 155 et seq. In Mr. Bayard’s instruction to Mr. Vignaud, June 13,
                            1888, quoted on page 161, the general nature of the secondary proof
                            acceptable is set forth. In a few words, it must establish that the
                            father was actually naturalized before the son reached his majority.</p>
                        <p>It may be added that the existing requirement of production of the
                            naturalization certificate has prevailed since 1873; and experience has
                            shown it to be necessary in order to prevent the Department or its
                            agents from granting passports to those who are not legally citizens of
                            the United States.</p>

                            her long and splendid career at half past 6 o’clock yesterday afternoon
                            at Osborne, in the Isle of Wight. Although she had been in declining
                            health for some months, it was not generally known until she was seized
                            with a fatal illness a few days ago. She died surrounded by her children
                            and grandchildren, including the Emperor of Germany, whose coining on
                            this pious pilgrimage has made a deep impression here. She commanded, as
                            no other personage of modern times has done, the affectionate homage of
                            mankind, and I am glad to see that the people of the United States are
                            foremost among her admirers outside the British Empire.</p>

                            which I have already complied by addressing to his lordship a note (copy
                            inclosed).</p>
                        <p>The new King enters upon his reign with the good will not of his own
                            subjects only, but of all the world. He is at this moment (2 p. m.)
                            holding his first council, and to-morrow at 10 o’clock he will be
                            proclaimed.</p>

                            instant, Saturday, I attended as the special representative of the
                            President the funeral of her illustrious Majesty the late Queen
                            Victoria. By direction of the earl marshal the special representatives
                            who had been designated by various nations joined the funeral procession
                            at Windsor and walked together behind the King and the Royal family and
                            Royal visitors. There were six special ambassadors—two from Turkey and
                            one each from France, the United States, Spain, and Japan. At the close
                            of the funeral service at St. George’s Chapel I attended luncheon given
                            by the King in St. George’s Hall, and after luncheon the King and Queen
                            received the members of the diplomatic corps. I expressed to His Majesty
                            the deep sympathy of the President, to which he replied that he had been
                            very certain of the sympathy of the President and people of the United
                            States and expressed his gratitude. The President’s wreath which had
                            been procured by your orders had been sent in his name to Windsor the
                            day before, and was conspicuously placed and greatly admired.</p>

                            authorizing attendance at her funeral by a special ambassador, and a

                            has made inquiry of His Majesty’s Government as to whether persons of

                            authorities to travel in the Philippine Islands.</p>
                        <p>It was reported to His Majesty’s Government in September, 1899, in
                            connection with a complaint from the Chinese minister at Washington as
                            to the general exclusion of Chinese from the islands, that it had been
                            decided by the United States Government to ask General Otis for further
                            and more definite information as to what steps had been taken in the
                            matter. No information has, however, reached my Government as to the
                            result of this reference to Manila, and the final decision of the United
                            States Government as to whether the Chinese exclusion act, though in
                            force in the United States, was or was not operative in the Philippines,
                            and I am instructed by the Marquis of Lansdowne to inquire whether you
                            are able to furnish me with the decision the United States Government

                            asked to be advised, for the information of the Government of the
                            Straits Settlements, whether Chinese persons who are British subjects
                            are permitted to travel in the Philippine Islands.</p>
                        <p>You also asked to be informed whether a determination has yet been

                            be operative in those islands.</p>
                        <p>Replying to both inquiries, I have the honor to state that the position
                            taken by the United States War Department, by whom the affairs of the
                            islands are being administered, is as follows: <list>

                                <item>Chinese persons are to be excluded from the Philippines
                                    “whether subjects of China or any other foreign power.”</item>

                                <item>That such exclusion is a military measure adopted to meet
                                    existing military necessity. Being a military expedient, it is
                                    not to be considered as in any way affecting the permanent
                                    policy of the government of the islands under the conditions of
                                    peace.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The military order relating to said exclusion did not extend
                                    the Chinese-exclusion acts of the United States Congress to and
                                    over the Philippine Islands as a law of the United States; the
                                    provisions of said acts were adopted as appropriate remedies for
                                    the military necessity, and made operative independently of the
                                    statute by authority resulting from military occupation.</item>

                            the claims commission, has just informed him that the British Government
                            offers £6,000 in full compensation for all claims of American citizens
                            deported from South Africa up to the present date. Four thousand pounds
                            was originally proposed by the British Government, but Mr. Crane induced
                            them to raise the amount to £6,000, and thinks that, considering the
                            nature of our claims, the offer is very liberal, being 50 per cent
                            better than terms made with other governments, and strongly urges
                            acceptance. Mr. Crane would like to be authorized to say, when the
                            commission meets at noon next Monday, that our claims have been settled.
                            Requests immediate instructions as to acceptance of the proposal.)</p>

                            copy of a telegram<note n="a" xml:id="d217fna">Printed ante.</note>
                            which I sent you on the 26th instant, after an interview with Mr. R.
                            Newton Crane, whom, as you are aware, has represented our Government <pb
                                n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0298"/>before the commission appointed
                            by His Majesty’s Government to inquire into the claims of the subjects
                            of friendly powers who were deported by order of the military
                            authorities from South Africa.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Crane called to inform me that he had received from Sir John Ardagh
                            an intimation to the effect that the British Government would be willing
                            to pay us £6,000, in full satisfaction of all the claims, to this date,
                            of American citizens for wrongful arrest, imprisonment, and deportation
                            from South Africa by the military authorities, and he strongly advised
                            acceptance of the offer. Mr. Crane added that, from the amounts which he
                            understood had been accepted by certain other powers, whose claimants
                            are much more numerous than ours, he was satisfied that this proposal
                            was 50 per cent better, in proportion, than that made to any other
                            government; and he expressed a desire to be placed in a position, when
                            the commission met yesterday, to state that our claims had been
                            settled.</p>
                        <p>Upon the receipt of your reply<note n="a" xml:id="d217fnb">Printed
                                ante.</note> to my telegram on the 26th instant, of which a copy is
                            inclosed, I wrote Mr. Crane a note, whereof I transmit a copy herewith,
                            together with that of his reply. From the latter you will perceive the
                            amounts which have been accepted by Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany,
                            Italy, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, in settlement of the
                            claims of the subjects and citizens of those countries. You will also
                            observe that a settlement has not yet been effected with France or the
                            Netherlands.</p>
                        <p>I had an interview to-day at the foreign office with Lord Lansdowne, who
                            informed me that His Majesty’s Government is prepared to pay £6,000 to
                            ours in settlement of the American claims, and I replied that I had, in
                            accordance with your instructions, authorized Mr. Crane to inform Sir
                            John Ardagh that our Government is willing to accept the amount in
                            question.</p>
                        <p>I ought to add that Mr. Crane, when I saw him on the 26th, said that it
                            was particularly desired that nothing should at present be made public
                            as to the amount which we had agreed to accept, but merely that it
                            should be known that our claim had been settled. Before the commission
                            met, however, another course appears to have been adopted, and the
                            amounts accepted by the powers whose claims have been settled were made
                            known, at the request of the chairman, to the commission.</p>

                                before the South African deportation claims commission, that the

                            </p>
                            <p>The settlement, so far as the United States Government is concerned,
                                is, in my opinion, an extremely favorable one, as it will afford
                                generous compensation to the claimants whose claims have merit. The
                                sum agreed upon is also very much larger in proportion than that
                                received by any other Government. The total amount awarded is
                                £69,550, and the total number of claimants among whom it is to be
                                divided is 1,100, which gives an average of £63 4s. 6d. for each
                                claimant. As there were only 15 claims presented by the American
                                Government, and the sum awarded to the United States is £6,000, the
                                average is £400 for each claimant, including the good, bad, and
                                indifferent. Some, you will remember, are obviously entitled to no
                                compensation, as certain of them were not American citizens, while
                                others took up arms against the English troops. The settlement
                                averages, roughly, a gross sum of $2,000 for each American claimant,
                                as against $316 for each claimant a subject of other
                                Governments.</p>
                            <p>In the course of a few days I will make a precis of each case and
                                suggest in what manner the award may equitably be distributed among
                                the claimants.</p>
                            <p>Sincerely, yours,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose herewith the
                            report of Mr. R. Newton Crane, upon the merits of the 15 claims
                            submitted by our Government through him to the South African deportation
                            compensation commission, which is so full and complete that no
                            additional observations or explanations appear to be necessary from me.
                            Mr. Crane has been to see life several times of late on the subject, and
                            has gone over at length the various considerations which have led to the
                            conclusions at which he has arrived with respect to the method of
                            distribution of the award; and I entirely concur in the views expressed
                            in the report.</p>
                        <p>I may add that Mr. Crane has devoted a great deal of time and attention
                            to the question of these claims ever since the commission has been
                            sitting, and the amount which he succeeded in persuading the <pb n="220"
                                xml:id="pg_220" facs="0300"/>British representative upon the
                            commission, Sir John Ardagh, to recommend his Government to offer us
                            does great credit to Mr. Crane’s tact and skill as a negotiator, as well
                            as to the desire of His Britannic Majesty’s Government to deal in a
                            liberal spirit with the claims put forward by our Government.</p>
                        <p>I would particularly call your attention to Mr. Crane’s observations,
                            under the heading “General remarks,” upon the misleading computation in
                            the tabular statement, setting forth the percentage of the awards to the
                            claims of each country, which appeared in the Times of the 15th instant.
                            Mr. Crane points out that the proper method of estimating the percentage
                            of the awards to each country is not the relation that such awards bear
                            to the total amount claimed by all the subjects or citizens of each
                            power, but the amount averaged by each claimant. If the latter mode of
                            computation be adopted, it will be seen how very much more, in
                            proportion to the number of our claimants, has been awarded to us than
                            to any other power.</p>

                            <p>Altogether 15 claims were presented, the claimants being Alfred J.
                                Giebner, Seigfried J. Ahrberg, Frank Crus, Francisco Pudjunos, John
                                Anderson, William Phelps, Dr. A. F. Conroy, Anna Wedekind, Charles
                                Fowles, John Joseph Maloney, H. M. Marmorstein, Johan
                                Sundt,-------Sharp, ------Lyons, and ------Nelkin. Of these persons
                                5 claim to be native-born citizens of the United States, although no
                                evidence is furnished as to the date or place of their birth, and 8
                                claim to be naturalized citizens. Of the other 2, Lyons and Sharp,
                                nothing is known. Eight were deported on suspicion of being
                                concerned in the Johannesburg plot to murder Lord Roberts and other
                                English officers; I was imprisoned at Natal as a Boer spy; I was
                                captured on the battlefield while serving, as he alleges, with a Red
                                Cross ambulance corps, attached to the Boer forces; and 3 were
                                compelled to leave the country for various reasons. Two were,
                                strictly speaking, not forcibly deported, but appear to have
                                voluntarily left South Africa, and at their own expense. The entire
                                amount claimed on account of actual losses was $52,278.29.</p>
                            <p>The commission heard all of the claims, so far as an ex parte
                                statement of them could be made, except those of Lyons and Sharp. No
                                claim has been forwarded from the Department of State on behalf of
                                these last-named claimants, but it was mentioned to the commission
                                that these persons had appealed to the United States Government and
                                that their names were embraced in the letters addressed by his
                                excellency the American ambassador to Lord Lansdowne on the 24th of
                                October, 1900, when the claims of American subjects were first
                                brought to the attention of His Majesty’s Government. Sundt’s claim
                                was presented to the commission by his solicitors in England,
                                Messrs. Tyrell, Lewis, Lewis &amp; Broadment, and Sundt was orally
                                examined by the commissioners. His claim was rejected on the ground
                                that it appeared from his own admission that he had voluntarily left
                                South Africa, and traveled to England at his own expense, and
                                therefore his case was one which did not come within the
                                jurisdiction of the commission. The claimant subsequently appealed
                                to the Department of State, and upon instructions from the
                                ambassador his claim was again presented to the English
                                authorities.</p>
                            <p>The commission announced that they would hear the various claims
                                without insisting upon any technical formality in the way of proof;
                                that they would give the representative of His Majesty’s Government,
                                Sir John Ardagh, an opportunity to explain why each individual had
                                been deported, and that then the claimants might put in any evidence
                                they could adduce in reply to the charges made by Sir John Ardagh.
                                This course was entered upon, but after the claims had been gone
                                through it was <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0301"/>intimated by
                                Sir John Ardagh that his Government desired, irrespective of any
                                action by the commission, to agree, if possible, with the
                                representatives of the various Governments upon a lump sum to be
                                received by each of the powers in full satisfaction of the demands
                                of their respective claimants, it being understood that His
                                Majesty’s Government was not to be concerned as to how the sums so
                                paid were allocated among the various claimants.</p>
                            <p>I communicated this proposition to his excellency the ambassador in
                                my letter of the 29th of August last, and stated that in my opinion,
                                for reasons therein stated, it was wise to accept it. In due course
                                I received authority to enter into negotiations with Sir John
                                Ardagh, and after numerous interviews, extending over some weeks, an
                                offer of £6,000 was made on behalf of His Majesty’s Government to
                                settle the American claims, and I was instructed to accept the same.
                                The result was announced at the meeting of the commission which was
                                held on the 28th of October, 1901, and the commission therefore
                                ceased to have any further consideration of the matter.</p>
                            <p>The settlement, in my opinion, is a very favorable one to the United
                                States, both in respect to the substance of the claims and the
                                relation they sustained to those put forward by other Governments.
                                The amount awarded to the American Government is more than 100 per
                                cent greater than that allowed to any other Government, whether the
                                amount claimed or the number of claimants be considered. I trust I
                                may be permitted in this connection to express my appreciation of
                                the courtesy, sense of fairness, and extreme indulgence shown by Sir
                                John Ardagh throughout the protracted negotiations before the
                                settlement was arrived at. It was extremely difficult to determine
                                the merits of most of the claims, not only so far as the facts were
                                concerned, but in the application of the principles of public
                                international law and comity, to assertion of facts which were
                                incapable of proof and were therefore considerately assumed.</p>

                            <p>As it is not improbable that the award of the British Government in
                                this instance may be quoted as a precedent in the future, it should
                                be noted that the above calculation gives a misleading idea of the
                                manner in which the claims have been settled, as must any
                                calculation based upon the relation the award made bears to the sums
                                claimed. The amount claimed is too often not the sum which a
                                claimant honestly thinks is justly due to him for the loss he has
                                suffered, but it is the sum which his caprice or cupidity fixes as
                                that which may posssibly be allowed him. In the present instance the
                                allowances demanded for “moral” damages by other claimants than the
                                Americans were very small. Among the American claimants themselves
                                there was a very wide disparity in appraising their losses. Of 3 men
                                in the same occupation, and the same employ, and the same domestic
                                surroundings, deported together, under almost identically the same
                                circumstances, 1 places his demand, at $5,220; another, at
                                $11,112.50; and another, at $50,000.</p>
                            <p>A fairer way of ascertaining what the award amounts to is by
                                computing what it averages per claimant, practically when, as in
                                this instance, those who make the claims were of practically the
                                same walk of life and employment, and deported under like
                                conditions.</p>

                            <p>I can not conclude this report without drawing the attention of the
                                Government to the fact, disclosed by affidavits filed with the State
                                Department, that some of the claimants have contracted to pay their
                                local attorneys for presenting their claims 50 per cent of whatever
                                sum may be awarded to them. In the case of one of the attorneys the
                                fee which he will receive, if the recommendations which I have made
                                in this report are carried out, will amount to £750. His services
                                consisted in filing memorials which, although he has been given
                                ample opportunity to do so, have not been supported by a single word
                                of proof of the assertions which they contain. He has been
                                acquainted with the charges made against his clients, but has either
                                been indifferent to them or unable to meet them. If it had been
                                necessary for him to embark in protracted litigation in their behalf
                                and to have devoted time, labor, and skill achieving success for
                                them, such compensation might not have been excessive. But in this
                                case his labors have been of no material advantage.</p>
                            <p>I therefore trust the Government may find some way of letting it be
                                known that in future such claims do not need the intermediation of
                                attorneys, but can be presented directly by citizens themselves. As
                                the appeals I have made to some of these attorneys to furnish me
                                with evidence to meet the accusation made by the British Government
                                against their clients have met with no response whatever, I think it
                                is only fair to presume that either they no longer represent their
                                former clients, or that the latter are not now living. In either
                                case the Government will be justified in refusing to pay over to the
                                attorneys such sums as may be allotted to their clients until the
                                latter have been directly communicated with, and have had the
                                circumstances explained to them, and have been given an opportunity
                                to confirm or withdraw any powers of attorney they may have
                                heretofore executed for the collection of their respective
                                claims.</p>

                        <p>Her Majesty’s embassy has been directed by Her Majesty’s Government to
                            ascertain from the United States Government what their views are as to
                            what rights and privileges can be claimed on behalf of British subjects
                            in Cuba.</p>
                        <p>It has been assumed by Her Majesty’s consul-general in Habana that,
                            failing any declaration to the contrary, the rights and immunities
                            hereto enjoyed by British subjects would be continued as long as the
                            temporary occupation lasted, but he was informed by the United States
                            military governor that the only rights which could now be claimed were
                            those under treaties between the United States and Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>It appears that Her Majesty’s consul-general, immediately after his
                            arrival, called on General Brooke, and, in reply to inquiries as to what
                            rights British subjects would enjoy under the new regime, was informed
                            that the existing laws would remain in force in all respects until
                            specifically altered or modified. General Wood now states that from
                            April 11, the date of the exchange of ratifications of the treaty of
                            Paris, all former treaties and conventions relating to the island ceased
                            to exist, and, as above mentioned, the only rights which could now be
                            claimed by British subjects were those which were secured by treaties
                            concluded between the United States and Great Britain.</p>

                            31, 1900, the United States Government does not regard existing treaties
                            as embodying rights and immunities of British subjects in Cuba, Cuba’s
                            affairs having been withdrawn from British <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226"

                            intervention.</p>
                        <p>The rights, immunities, etc., of aliens in Cuba are elaborately
                            prescribed in the alien law of 1870, which the Attorney-General has
                            recently held to be in force in Cuba. (Opinion of April 26 to Secretary
                            of War; copy handed herewith.) That law, of 57 sections, throws open the
                            courts in Cuba to protect such rights. It is applicable to British
                            subjects.</p>

                            <p>The inclosures of your letter show the following order of the judge
                                of Santa Clara, dated the 25th of July, 1899:</p>
                            <p>“As it appears that Don Ramon Martí Buguet, a native of Tarragona,
                                died on the 2d instant, in the precinct of Baez, belonging to this
                                judicial district, without leaving any relatives or testamentary
                                provisions, this court has ordered the proclamation of the
                                intestacy.” “As it appears that, on the 15th instant, the Spanish
                                consul at Cienfuegos addressed a communication to this court,
                                stating that, having heard that the Spanish subject, Don Ramon
                                Martí, had died intestate, he has appointed Don Benito Menduiña,
                                under article 44 of the alien law in force, to draw up the inventory
                                and <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0307"/>to carry out all the
                                other proceedings provided by said law.” “Considering, first, that
                                there is no evidence to show that Don Ramon Martí had obtained the
                                registration required by article 9 of the treaty of Paris, concluded
                                between Spain and the United States on the 10th of December of last
                                year, in order to retain his Spanish nationality, and (considering)
                                that, until such registration is proved by record, he must be
                                regarded as a native of Cuba and, consequently, subject only and
                                exclusively to the provisions of the law of civil procedure and the
                                civil code now in force.” “Considering, that, even if the reason
                                hereinbefore stated did not exist, the provisions of the alien law
                                cited by the Spanish consul at Cienfuegos would still not be
                                applicable, because, under article 11 of the said treaty, Spaniards
                                residing in the territories over which Spain has ceded or abandoned
                                her sovereignty, remain subject, in civil and criminal matters, to
                                the jurisdiction of the country in which they reside, in accordance
                                with the ordinary laws in force in such territories, and must appear
                                and plead in the same manner as the citizens of the country in which
                                they reside.” “In view of the articles of the treaty of Paris, it is
                                declared that the intervention of the Spanish consul at Cienfuegos
                                in those proceedings can not be permitted; and it is ordered that he
                                be notified of this decision by a courteous note.”</p>
                            <p>An examination of Article IX of the treaty of Paris shows that
                                Spaniards residing in the ceded or relinquished territories were to
                                have a year within which to make up their minds whether to
                                preserve—not acquire—Spanish nationality, and I think there is no
                                doubt that a Spaniard born in the peninsula who died in Cuba before
                                the expiration of that year was, in the contemplation of the treaty,
                                a Spanish subject at the time of his death.</p>
                            <p>Article XI of the treaty relied upon by the judge is, in the English
                                copy, as follows:</p>
                            <p>“The Spaniards residing in the territories over which Spain by this
                                treaty cedes or relinquishes her sovereignty shall be subject in
                                matters civil as well as criminal to the jurisdiction of the courts
                                of the country wherein they reside pursuant to the ordinary laws
                                governing the same; and they shall have the right to appear before
                                such courts and to pursue the same course as citizens of the country
                                to which the courts belong.”</p>
                            <p>The first part of this article treats of the position of Spanish
                                residents when proceeded against in court, the latter provides
                                implements for their use. The former subjects them as defendants to
                                the tribunals, according to the ordinary laws which may regulate the
                                competency of the tribunals (leyes comunes que regulen su
                                competencia); the latter places at their disposal, though aliens,
                                the right to appear before the tribunals (comparenciaen juicio)
                                according to the same laws of procedure (forma) and carrying on the
                                same course of pleading and practice (procedimientos) as citizens of
                                the country.</p>
                            <p>In so placing at their disposal the free right to appear and proceed
                                like citizens, I do not understand that the treaty intended to make
                                it unlawful to give them better methods of appearing or proceeding
                                as alien parties or as Spanish residents in addition to those of
                                citizens. The provision was for their benefit—they were to be
                                allowed, at least, the same “forma,” and same “procedimientos” as
                                citizens. On the other hand, there is still less reason to say that
                                as defendants they could not be subjected to any laws regulating the
                                jurisdiction of the courts except those concerning cases between
                                citizens of the country. The first part of Article XI says nothing
                                of citizens of the country. It says they shall be subject to the
                                tribunals according to the ordinary, the usual (comunes), laws
                                concerning their competency or jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>What is meant by ordinary or usual? It was usual in every one of the
                                countries mentioned to have laws concerning aliens, laws which
                                incidentally affected the competency of the courts. Article IX of
                                the treaty alludes to these long familiar laws and the possibility
                                of others to be enacted. Such as these, in my opinion, are not
                                excluded by the word ordinary (común).</p>
                            <p>Spanish residents at the time of the making of the treaty were
                                somewhat uneasy lest they should be persecuted, and desired to be
                                guaranteed that a proper course of procedure would be followed in
                                criminal and civil actions against them; but they expected to be
                                aliens, subjects of a foreign sovereign, and to be treated by the
                                laws as such. They desired to be subjected to the tribunals only as
                                other aliens might be; to the ordinary tribunals acting without
                                special authority directed against them.</p>
                            <p>Article 47 of the alien law, which denied any special fuero to aliens
                                (not, as translated, “special right or privilege”), operated to
                                confirm a transfer of aliens (extranjeros) in the provinces, from
                                the old fuero de extranjería and other special fueros (e. g., of war
                                and marine), to the same courts to which Spaniards were subject,
                                “according to the cases,” certainly without any purpose by so doing
                                to make them cease to be aliens or to prevent the interposition in
                                administrations of their respective consuls; and I think it was as
                                little the intent of the provisions of Article XI of the treaty to
                                exclude that interposition. The article forbids the establishment of
                                    <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0308"/>the old fuero of aliens
                                and that of a new fuero of Spaniards, but not all laws affecting the
                                business concerning aliens which may come into the ordinary courts
                                or fueros “according to the cases.” Such a treaty provision might
                                even be unconstitutional and void.</p>
                            <p>The reasons given in 1868 and 1869 for the general abandonment of
                                special fueros for the ordinary or common fuero were:</p>
                            <p>“In those regions (colonies), as in Spain, the diversity of fueros
                                paralyzes the march of the administration of justice by the numerous
                                jurisdictions (competencias) to which it gives rise, disorganizes
                                the judicial hierarchy, renders impossible the formation of a
                                correct and enlightened jurisprudence, and is the cause at times of
                                contradictory judgments, in identical cases, which diminishes
                                respect for the law and for the tribunals.”</p>
                            <p>I can not suppose, without’ manifest proof, that the United States
                                were stipulating to cripple permanently in Porto Rico and the
                                Philippines, and (by persuasion) in Cuba, the vital power to make
                                and judicially enforce laws concerning alien inhabitants.</p>
                            <p>It must be remembered that, so far as Cuba is concerned, this Article
                                XI does not bear the same relation to the alien law as though the
                                latter were an act of Congress. The treaty is an agreement between
                                Spain and the United States; supreme law for and over the latter,
                                but not for and over Cuba. It obliges us, while acting in that
                                country, to see to it that the Spaniards there are treated as the
                                Article XI intends; but the alien law, while temporarily continued
                                and enforced by the power of the United States, is rather the law of
                                and for another country. It is an old law in Cuba, and is doubtless
                                intended to be left in Cuba when we and our treaty are gone.</p>
                            <p>In my opinion, then, there is no reason to say that Article XI of our
                                treaty prevents article 44 of the alien law of Cuba from being
                                applicable to the estate of Don Ramon Martí y Buguet.</p>
                            <p>Both of the conclusions of the court at Santa Clara, therefore, as I
                                think, proceeded from erroneous views of the treaty of 1898.</p>
                            <p>Your third question is:</p>
                            <p>“If the request of the Spanish consul to be allowed to participate in
                                the administration of said estate was improperly refused by the
                                court, did the court thereafter possess jurisdiction to administer
                                upon said estate?”</p>
                            <p>At first view, this seemed to me a question so exclusively of Spanish
                                civil law, with which the secretary of justice and the courts of
                                Cuba are familiar, that I was disposed to suggest that it be
                                referred to them for consideration in the light of the views
                                concerning the treaty hereinbefore set forth. But as I perceived
                                from the inclosures of your letter that two secretaries of justice
                                and some local official attorneys in Cuba have had this matter under
                                consideration, and as I recognized that the international aspect of
                                it might render it difficult for the question to be determined by
                                the familiar rules of the Spanish law concerning appeals,
                                proceedings in cassation, decisions between conflicting
                                jurisdictions, etc., it seemed to me better to attempt to give a
                                direct answer to your inquiry.</p>
                            <p>An examination of the original Spanish of the alien law, article 44
                                (of which you inclosed a translation), makes it clearer that the
                                first paragraph of that article aims at the preservation of the
                                property for the benefit of the heirs, rather than the exercise of
                                the judicial power of Cuba in determining who may be the heirs or
                                determining any other question concerning the estate.</p>
                            <p>Who, then, is expected by the alien law to determine such
                                questions—the consul, the local judge, or both? If the consul is to
                                have any judicial function in the matter, is he with the local judge
                                to constitute a tribunal exercising the judicial power of Cuba, is
                                he to exercise the judicial power of his own country and wholly
                                exclude the local judge from judicial action, or is the consul to
                                exercise the judicial power of his own country upon certain
                                questions and to be the administrator as an officer of his own
                                country, and the judge, with regard to other questions, to step in
                                and exercise the judicial power of Cuba?</p>
                            <p>It seems to me that some light may be thrown upon these questions by
                                articles 42, 43, and 45 of the alien law, articles 42 and 43
                                speaking (in the original Spanish) of demands giving rise to a
                                special set of questions, and article 45 providing that in intestate
                                proceedings the Spanish court shall have jurisdiction only of those
                                demands. In the translation of the alien law which you sent me, the
                                word “demands” is omitted from articles 42 and 43, and your
                                translation of them, and of articles 44 and 45, is as follows:</p>
                            <p>“Article 42. They shall also be subject to said laws and courts in
                                all suits instituted by or against them for the fulfillment of
                                obligations contracted within and outside of Spain in favor of
                                Spaniards, or which involve the ownership or possession of property
                                situated in Spanish territory.</p>
                            <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0309"/>
                            <p>“Article 43. The Spanish tribunals shall also have jurisdiction over
                                and shall take cognizance of suits between aliens brought before
                                them and which involve the fulfillment of obligations contracted or
                                to be fulfilled in Spain.</p>
                            <p>“Article 44. In the case of an alien dying intestate the judicial
                                authority of the town in which the death occurs shall, together with
                                the nearest consul of the nation to which the deceased belonged, or
                                with the person appointed by the consul in his stead, take an
                                inventory of the property and goods and shall take the necessary
                                steps to have the same placed under custody and at the disposal of
                                the heirs.</p>
                            <p>“Should the alien be a resident, and should he die outside of his
                                domicile, the judge of the latter, to whom notice shall be sent by
                                the judge of the place where the death occurred, shall fulfill the
                                provisions of the foregoing paragraph with regard to the property
                                and effects of the deceased existing there.</p>
                            <p>“Should there be no consul in the town where the death occurred or in
                                the domicile, the judicial authority, while awaiting the arrival of
                                the consul, whom he shall advise immediately, or of his delegate,
                                shall only take the measures necessary for the custody of the
                                property and of the goods.</p>
                            <p>“Article 45. In intestate as well as in testamentary successions of
                                aliens, the Spanish courts shall have cognizance only of the claims
                                and demands referred to in the foregoing articles.”</p>
                            <p>Further light, I think, can be thrown upon the questions by an
                                examination of two treaties, the making of which closely preceded
                                the alien law of 1870, one of Spain with France (A. D. 1862), and
                                the other of Spain with Italy (A. D. 1867). I quote three articles,
                                which are substantially the same in both treaties.</p>
                            <p>“XVII. In case of the decease of any subject of one of the
                                contracting parties in the territory of the other, the local
                                authorities must give immediate notice to the consul-general,
                                consul, vice-consul, or consular agent in whose district the decease
                                has occurred, and they, on their part, must give the same notice to
                                the local authorities when the decease comes to their knowledge
                                first.</p>
                            <p>“If an Italian in Spain or a Spaniard in Italy should die without
                                making a will, or without appointing a testamentary executor, or if
                                the legitimate or testamentary heirs should be minors, incapable or
                                absent, or if the testamentary executors appointed should be
                                incapable, or should not be found in the place where the property
                                has been left, the consuls-general, consuls, and consular agents of
                                the deceased’s nation shall have the right of proceeding
                                successively to the following operations:</p>
                            <p>“1. To affix seals, ex officio or at the request of the parties
                                interested, on all the movable property and papers of the deceased,
                                giving notice of this operation to the competent local authority,
                                who may be present and affix his own seals also.</p>
                            <p>“These seals, as well as those of the consular agent, must not be
                                removed without the consent of the local authority. Nevertheless,
                                if, after a notice addressed by the consul or vice consul to the
                                local authority, inviting him to be present at the removal of the
                                double seals, he should not appear within forty-eight hours from the
                                time of receiving the notice, the said agent may proceed to the
                                operation by himself.</p>
                            <p>“2. To draw up the inventory of all the goods and effects of the
                                deceased, in the presence of the local authority, if he has attended
                                in consequence of the aforesaid notification.</p>
                            <p>“The local authority shall put his signature to the reports drawn up
                                in his presence, and shall have no right to demand fees of any kind
                                for his official intervention in said matters.</p>
                            <p>“3. To provide for the sale at public auction of all the movable
                                effects of the estate which may deteriorate, and of those which may
                                be difficult to preserve, as well as of the collections or effects
                                for the disposal of which there may be favorable opportunities.</p>
                            <p>“4. To deposit in a secure place the effects and securities
                                inventoried; to keep the amount of the debts and incomes received
                                and the proceeds of the sales, in the consular house, or to intrust
                                them to some merchant who gives good security. In both cases he must
                                proceed in concurrence with the local authority who has taken part
                                in the previous operations, if, after the summons referred to in the
                                following paragraph, subjects of the country, or of a third power,
                                should represent themselves as interested in the estate.</p>
                            <p>“5. To announce the death which has taken place, and to summon, by
                                means of the newspapers of the place and of the deceased’s country,
                                such persons as may have claims against the estate, in order that
                                they may send in their respective claims duly approved within the
                                legal period of each country.</p>
                            <p>“If creditors of the estate should appear, their debts must be paid
                                in fifteen days from the completion of the inventory, if there
                                should be ready money enough for the purpose; and if not, as soon as
                                the funds can be obtained in the most convenient <pb n="230"
                                    xml:id="pg_230" facs="0310"/>manner, or within the period fixed
                                by common consent between the consul and the majority of those
                                interested. If the respective consuls should refuse payment of one
                                or more of the claims brought in, alleging the insufficiency of the
                                property of the estate to satisfy them, the creditors may, if they
                                consider it advantageous to their interests, demand of the competent
                                authority the power of constituting themselves as a body.</p>
                            <p>“Such a declaration having been obtained by the legal means
                                established in each of the two nations respectively, the consuls or
                                vice-consuls must immediately consign to the judicial authority or
                                to the syndics of bankruptcy, as the case may be, all the documents,
                                effects, and securities belonging to the estate, and the said agents
                                will remain as the representatives of the heirs who are absent,
                                minors or incapable.</p>
                            <p>“6. To administer and liquidate the estate, either themselves or
                                through a person appointed on their responsibility, the local
                                authorities having no power to interfere in those operations, unless
                                subjects of the country, or of a third power, should have to prove
                                rights upon the estate itself, and that in such case difficulties
                                should arise chiefly proceeding from some claim which gives rise to
                                discussion among the parties; the consuls-general, consuls, vice
                                consuls or consular agents, having no right to decide therein, it
                                must be brought before the tribunals of the country, whose place it
                                is to provide for and settle such difficulties.</p>
                            <p>“The said consular agents will then act as representatives of the
                                estate; that is, they will retain the administration and the right

                                proceeding to the sale of the effects in the periods before
                                prescribed, they will take care of the interests of the heirs, with
                                the power of appointing advocates to maintain their rights before
                                the tribunals; and it is understood that they must furnish all the
                                papers and documents necessary to explain the question which is
                                submitted to their judgment.</p>
                            <p>“When the sentence has been pronounced, the consuls-general, consuls,
                                vice-consuls or consular agents must execute it, unless they
                                interpose an appeal; and they will also continue of full right to
                                carry on the liquidation which was suspended until judgment had been
                                passed.</p>
                            <p>“7. To consign the inheritance or the produce thereof to the lawful
                                heirs or to their agents, but not until the expiration of the term
                                of six months from the date on which the announcement of the death
                                was published in the newspapers.</p>
                            <p>“8. To constitute, whenever it maybe necessary, a guardianship or
                                trusteeship, according to the laws of their own country.</p>
                            <p>“XVIII. If an Italian die in Spain or a Spaniard in Italy, at a place
                                where there is no consular agent of his nation, the competent local
                                authority shall proceed, in accordance with the laws of the country,
                                to make an inventory of the effects, and to liquidate the property
                                left, under the obligation of rendering an account, as soon as it is
                                possible, of the results of his operations, to the respective
                                embassy or legation or to the consulate or vice-consulate nearest to
                                the place where the property has been left, but from the instant
                                that the consular agent nearest to the place where the property has
                                been left makes his appearance, either in person or by means of any
                                delegate, the intervention of the local authority must be in
                                accordance with the provision in Article XVII of this
                                convention.</p>
                            <p>“XIX. The consuls-general, consuls, vice-consuls, and consular agents
                                of both nations shall attend exclusively to the inventories and
                                other precautionary measures for the preservation of the hereditary
                                property left by sailors of their nation, dying ashore or on board
                                the vessels, of their country, whether during the voyage or in the
                                port of their arrival.”</p>
                            <p>It is clear that under this treaty system between these three Latin
                                countries—Spain, Italy, and France—the consul is to exercise an
                                extraterritorial judicial power and to be the real administrator of
                                the estate, but that disputes in which the country where the death
                                occurred has some special interest, as where its own people or the
                                people of a third country, whom it should protect, are concerned,
                                are to be carved out of his jurisdiction and settled by the local
                                judicial authority, leaving him to resume his functions when these
                                special questions have been determined.</p>
                            <p>Similar treaties had anciently been made with England. Thus, in
                                Warden’s Consular Establishment, page 252, we read:</p>
                            <p>“In a treaty with Spain, made in 1667, it was stipulated that the
                                goods and estates of Englishmen, dying without will in that Kingdom,
                                were to be put into inventory, with their papers, writings, and
                                books of account by the consul, or other public minister of the King
                                of Great Britain, and placed in the hands of two or three merchants
                                named by the said consul or public minister, to be kept for the
                                proprietors or creditors; and that neither the cruzada, nor any
                                other judicatory whatsoever, should intermeddle therein; which,
                                also, in the like case was to be observed in England toward the
                                subjects of the King of Spain.”</p>
                            <p>Still further light is shed upon our questions, I think, by the
                                consular system of Spain, in which her consuls in foreign countries
                                are authorized to exercise all the <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231"
                                    facs="0311"/>powers of courts of first instance, if permitted to
                                do so by the laws of the country to which they are accredited.</p>
                            <p>I can not but think, from these and similar considerations, that the
                                privilege intended to be accorded to foreign consuls by article 44
                                of the alien law was not merely to be present and see that the local
                                judicial authority did what was proper, nor to exercise any part of
                                the judicial power of the country to which the consul was
                                accredited, but to be the administrator and judge in charge of the
                                business of settling the estate and succession.</p>
                            <p>It seems-to me, therefore, that to oust the consul altogether, as was
                                done in the matter of the estate of Don Ramon Martí y Buguet, and
                                proceed without him, was to proceed without jurisdiction, and I
                                therefore answer your third question in the negative.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully,</p>

                            Lilly white, a naturalized American citizen (British born), asking me to
                            present his claim set forth in the petition to the British Government,
                            in respect to which I have the honor to ask your instructions, having
                            myself a strong opinion that he is entitled to have it presented
                            diplomatically.</p>
                        <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0312"/>
                        <p>You will observe that it is the case of the arrest in New Zealand of the
                            wrong man for a crime committed in England seven years before, and taken
                            away from his residence and his work; kept in custody for more than 6
                            months, under circumstances of very considerable hardship; transported
                            to England and there discharged, there being clear proof that he was not
                            the man.</p>
                        <p>You will also observe that Lillywhite resided in the United States most
                            of the time for nine years, from 1885 to 1894, during which period, in
                            1890, he became an American citizen, and still claims full rights as
                            such. I inclose copy of a letter just received from Mr. Barratt, his
                            counsel, in answer to my inquiry whether, in the six years since he left
                            the United States, he had any idea of abandoning his American
                            citizenship—which appears to be satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>What has thus far occurred in respect to the claim is this: About the 1st
                            of July, soon after his release, which occurred on the 26th of June, he
                            called on me to know what he should do. The newspapers had expressed
                            much sympathy for him, and the home secretary, in answer to a question
                            in the House of Commons, had intimated that he was waiting to hear from
                            the claimant. It seemed to me that it was a case which the British
                            Government would prefer to take care of themselves in a liberal spirit,
                            without any formal or official intervention—and I told him that I would
                            say so to Lord Lansdowne unofficial, which I did. He said that he would
                            speak to the home secretary about it, and I asked him to let me know
                            what steps he would suggest the claimant should take. After some time I
                            received the inclosed note of July 23, from Lord Lansdowne—which, as I
                            told him after perusing it, seemed to treat my inquiry as official
                            rather than unofficial, as I had regarded it; but he said that in such a
                            matter he thought that made no difference, and expressed a general
                            disposition to do the fait-thing in the matter. I have concluded that,
                            if you regard him as entitled to it, the claimant will be greatly aided
                            by having his case presented officially to the foreign office under your
                            express authority. You will observe that Lord Lansdowne says that, “if
                            any application is made direct by Mr. Lillywhite, it might be addressed
                            to the mayor of Colchester,” but I am of the opinion that a proceeding
                            so initiated would have but a slim chance. I have not, however, felt
                            authorized to initiate officially, without your express instructions, a
                            diplomatic claim.</p>
                        <p>You will observe that Lord Lansdowne asks for information as to the
                            practice in the United States in such cases, but I do not believe that
                            such a case has ever occurred in the United States. It is not an
                            ordinary case of a false arrest and imprisonment. The man was torn from
                            his place of residence and brought half round the globe, and subjected
                            to great hardships, on a mistake of identity; and I think that Lord
                            Lansdowne and the home secretary both regard it as an unusual case and
                            entitled to exceptional treatment. And I shall be much surprised if
                            investigation should not disclose many cases somewhat similar, which
                            have been presented diplomatically with favorable results (vide cases in
                            Vol. IV Moore’s International Arbitration Digest).</p>
                        <p>I therefore inclose the petition for your perusal and instructions; and,
                            whatever your conclusion may be, I will be obliged if you will return

                                white, and he states that the Labor Party in New Zealand several
                                times approached him about becoming a British subject and standing
                                as a labor candidate for the New Zealand Parliament. He always
                                refused to change his citizenship from American to British.</p>
                            <p>He also states that when going into the hospital at Wellington, New
                                Zealand, in 1900, he gave his proper description as an American, and
                                it so appeared on the card at the head of his bed in the
                                hospital—that he was well known amongst his fellows there to have
                                strong American sentiments.</p>
                            <p>The evidence annexed to the petition shows that he went by the name
                                of “Yank” amongst his fellow-workmen.</p>
                            <p>This, I think, meets the suggestion that he may have abandoned his

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: On the 28th ultimo your
                                excellency made a verbal representation relative to the case of
                                Charles Lillywhite, a United States citizen who was brought to this
                                country from New Zealand on a charge of murder and who was
                                discharged on the ground of mistaken identity. You intimated that
                                Lillywhite had a claim to compensation on account of the mistake
                                made by the British authorities.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to inform your excellency that an inquiry has been
                                made and that the following is a summary of the facts bearing on the
                                matter.</p>
                            <p>On the 11th of January, 1894, a coroner’s jury at Colchester returned
                                a verdict of willful murder against one Arthur Blatch. The crime
                                charged was one of special atrocity, and the evidence against Blatch
                                was considered conclusive.</p>
                            <p>It was at first believed that Blatch had gone to Chicago, and an
                                application was made to the United States authorities for his
                                extradition, but he could not be traced in that town. In February,
                                1897, the Colchester police received news from the police at
                                Wellington, New Zealand, that Blatch had been seen there, but an
                                endeavor made at the time to arrest him led to no result. In
                                November of last year, however, the man identified as Blatch was
                                arrested at Wellington; the warrants issued by the coroner and the
                                mayor of Colchester in 1894 were sent for execution, together with
                                the evidence taken in the case, and in due course an order was made
                                for the prisoner’s return to this country.</p>
                            <p>On his appearance before the magistrates it was conclusively shown to
                                be a case of mistaken identity, the defendant being Charles
                                Lillywhite and not Arthur Blatch; but it should be mentioned that
                                besides the witness on whose information the prisoner was arrested,
                                2 police constables specially sent out from Colchester, and another
                                witness, positively identified the prisoner as Blatch.</p>
                            <p>In cases in this country where one man has been arrested in mistake
                                for another and is discharged by the magistrate, it is not the
                                practice for any compensation to be given from public funds. His
                                Majesty’s Government, however, are not aware of any previous case in
                                which a mistake of this kind has led to the defendant being conveyed
                                for so long a distance. If any application for compensation is made
                                direct by Mr. Lillywhite, it might be addressed to the mayor of
                                Colchester; but no opinion can be expressed as to the manner in
                                which it would be dealt with until the precise nature of the claim
                                is known.</p>
                            <p>In considering any such application it would be of advantage to His
                                Majesty’s Government to know whether it is customary for any
                                compensation to be given from Federal funds or from other public
                                sources to persons arrested by mistake, and generally to be
                                furnished with any information as to the practice in the United
                                States with regard to compensation in analogous cases. I shall be
                                grateful if your excellency can assist me on these points.</p>
                            <p>I have to add that Lillywhite’s passage back to New Zealand will be
                                paid to him if he applies to the home office, Whitehall.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As stated in my note to Mr. Choate of

                                the home department his excellency’s note of September 20, together

                                under the fugitive offenders act, 1881, for a murder committed at
                                Colchester in 1894.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to inform you that the matter has received most

                            <p>The case appears to be one in which Mr. Lillywhite has most
                                unfortunately been the victim of an honest mistake on the part of
                                certain witnesses, and that everything arising out of that mistake
                                has been done in due course of the law to which he was subject in
                                consequence of his residence in a British colony. Theoretically
                                therefore there is no more reason in this case for compensation than
                                in other cases in which persons are subjected to inconvenience or
                                imprisonment in consequence of mistakes of the same character.</p>
                            <p>Having regard, however, to all the circumstances, which were, no
                                doubt, such as to impose special hardship on Mr. Lillywhite, His
                                Majesty’s Government are prepared to grant him the sum of £600 by
                                way of solatium, and also the cost of his return journey to New
                                Zealand.</p>
                            <p>The compensation offered in this exceptional case must not, however,
                                be regarded as forming any precedent for the grant of compensation
                                to other defendants should any similar case occur.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. White</hi>: Lillywhite says he will
                                take the £600, but desires us to see whether the Goverment of His
                                British Majesty will not grant him some increase to help in paying
                                his legal expenses and other disbursements.</p>
                            <p>He is not ungrateful for the offer made, but has been put to large
                                expenses during the past year, and must pay his relatives who have
                                spent a good deal in helping him out of his difficulties.</p>
                            <p>These expenses will largely deplete the £600 when received. He has
                                lost a permanent place given him at the time of his arrest. His
                                ankles were broken by the fall from a scaffold, and this permanent
                                place was given him largely for that reason. He has had treatment in
                                hospital here for his feet, which at times are so painful that he
                                has difficulty in walking. Hence he is not in the position of an
                                ordinary, healthy workingman who can actively get about and attend
                                to work.</p>
                            <p>He had hoped that £1,000 might have been granted him, and trusts that
                                His Majesty’s Government can see the way to add to this offer, for
                                he has to start life again greatly handicapped.</p>
                            <p>With many thanks for the trouble taken already by the ambassador and
                                yourself,</p>

                        <p>I am instructed by Lord Lansdowne to express to you the feelings of deep
                            sorrow and consternation with which His Majesty’s Government have
                            received the news of President McKinley’s death. They share the feelings
                            of the Government and people of the United States in face of the great
                            national calamity which has befallen them. It is a grievous misfortune
                            not only to the community of which he was the chief officer, but for the
                            whole civilized world in which his personality filled so conspicuous and
                            distinguished a place. In England, where the President was regarded with
                            widespread admiration and good will, his death will occasion universal
                            grief. I am to add the expression of the respectful sympathy of His
                            Majesty’s Government with Mrs. McKinley and the members of the
                            President’s family in their irreparable loss.</p>

                                Great Britain agree to use their good offices, wherever or however
                                it may be most expedient, in order to procure the establishment of

                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Article V.</hi></p>
                            <p>The contracting parties further engage, that when the said canal

                                Neither party, however, shall withdraw the aforesaid protection and

                                or warlike materials in the canal except in case of accidental
                                hindrance of the transit, and in such case the transit shall be

                                the canal, within three marine miles of either end. Vessels of war
                                of a belligerent shall not remain in such waters longer than
                                twenty-four hours at any one time except in case of distress, and in

                        <p>The information given below is believed to be correct, yet is not to be

                            foreign country.</p>
                        <p>The Greek Government does not, as a general statement, recognize a change
                            of nationality on the part of a former Greek without the consent of the
                            King, and a former Greek who has not completed his military service and
                            who is not exempt therefrom under the military code may be arrested upon
                            his return to Greece. The practice of the Greek Government is not,
                            however, uniform, but American citizens of Greek origin are advised to
                            find out before returning what status they may expect to enjoy.
                            Information should be sought directly from the Greek Government, and
                            this Department always refuses to act as intermediary in seeking the
                            information.</p>
                        <p>There is no treaty on the subject of naturalized citizens between the
                            United States and Greece.</p>
                        <p>Passports are not required in Greece, but may be useful in establishing
                            American citizenship.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that a careful
                            perusal of the records of the legation at Athens, supplemented by
                            outside inquiries, convinced me it was my duty to secure, if possible,
                            the discharge from the Greek army of Leonidas Economopoulos, a native of
                            Greece, who in 1899 became a naturalized American citizen.</p>
                        <p>This particular case had been the subject of extensive correspondence
                            between my immediate predecessor and the Greek Government for a period
                            extending over one year and a half; but, owing to the fact that no
                            treaty covering such cases existed between the United States and Greece,
                            the earnest, intelligent and persistent efforts of Mr. Hardy had been
                            unavailing in the premises.</p>

                                <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: I beg to call your
                                    attention to the fact that an American citizen is at present
                                    serving in the Greek army, and to request your excellency to
                                    give the particulars of the case, which I respectfully submit,
                                    your careful consideration.</p>
                                <p>Leonidas Economopoulos emigrated from Greece to the United States
                                    in January, 1893, at the age of 15 years, and, in accordance
                                    with the laws of that country, was duly naturalized in 1899. In
                                    September of the same year, receiving a telegram imforming him
                                    of the illness of his father, he hurried to his former home near
                                    Sparta without having previously procured royal assent to his
                                    expatriation from His Majesty the King of Greece. To his mind
                                    the urgency of the summons admitted of no delay. He contemplated
                                    an early return to Brooklyn, where he resided.</p>
                                <p>Shortly after his arrival in Greece, Economopoulos was arrested,
                                    and notwithstanding his declaration of American citizenship and
                                    against his protest, was compelled to enter the Greek army. In
                                    Athens he was assigned to the Fourth Battery, Second Regiment
                                    Field Artillery, and he is still in the Greek service.</p>
                                <p>While there is no naturalization treaty between Greece and the
                                    United States, it is believed your sense of justice in this
                                    particular case, as well as an act of comity toward the
                                    Government I represent, will induce your excellency to promptly
                                    order the discharge of Mr. Economopoulos in order that he may
                                    return to the country of his adoption where he is in every
                                    respect possessed of full citizenship.</p>
                                <p>In embracing this opportunity to exchange with you felicitations
                                    on the very friendly relations so happily existing between our
                                    respective Governments, I take occasion, etc.,</p>

                                    from the Greek army of Leonidas Economopoulos, I have the honor
                                    to inform you that although I have the greatest wish to comply
                                    with your excellency’s wish and to consider this act one of the
                                    smallest proofs of my friendly sentiments toward the Government
                                    which you represent, unfortunately the laws of this country do
                                    not permit me to order that the name of the above-mentioned
                                    Economopoulos be removed from the register of the conscripts and
                                    to order his dismissal from the Greek army, because he did not
                                    observe the formalities required by the Greek laws to obtain
                                    foreign nationality, as explained in the correspondence that has
                                    been previously exchanged on this subject. If an exception is
                                    made in the case of Economopoulos it must be extended as well to
                                    all Greeks who are residing in foreign countries.</p>
                                <p>However, as I am inspired with extremely friendly sentiments
                                    toward the Government of the United States, and also toward your
                                    excellency, I shall order the discharge of Economopoulos from
                                    the ranks of the Greek army if I can find any reason whatsoever
                                    (of health or family) permitting me to dismiss him.</p>

                            of an odious crime, has caused the Royal Government profound feeling;

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that during the
                            last few days Athens has been the scene of mob demonstration which
                            yesterday almost assumed the proportions of a revolution. Briefly, the
                            reason for this disturbance was the recent translation and publication
                            in Athens of the Bible in vulgar Greek. Expressions were employed by the
                            translators, which the Hellenes regard as unfit to be printed in the
                            Holy Scriptures. The work was inaugurated and completed with the
                            approval of the Metropolitan, the head of the synod of the Greek Church
                            in Greece.</p>
                        <p>The students of the university at Athens and the Greeks generally are
                            bitterly opposed to any change in the text of their Bible, which, while
                            of ancient origin and dating back to the Byzantine period, is understood
                            by all and is written in the purest Greek. * * *</p>
                        <p>Mass meetings were held in front of the university buildings on the
                            afternoons of November 19 and 20, at which violent speeches were made in
                            denunciation of the objectionable biblical translation and of all those
                            identified with it. Large crowds of excited citizens paraded the
                            streets, and the signs were ominous of a serious public
                            demonstration.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday, November 21, was a fête day. The shops and factories were
                            closed and the streets were thronged with all classes of people. A
                            public demonstration was announced to take place in the afternoon, in
                            which it was advertised that the different labor unions would
                            participate. Fearing the result, the Government ordered out all the
                            military troops in the city, and 800 marines were brought to Athens from
                            the Greek men-of-war at Piraesus. Infantry, cavalry, and large bodies of
                            gendarmes were posted at different points in the city and a cordon of
                            marines was thrown about the palace.</p>
                        <p>This show of military force had the effect of aggravating the situation,
                            and late in the afternoon the expected collision took place between the
                            authorities and the aroused Athenians. The mob, now numbering over
                            25,000, proceeded to the ministry of finance and demolished the windows
                            of the building. Thereupon, shots were fired upon the crowd by police
                            officers and employees of the ministry. The rioters responded with
                            pistols and stones, and were only dispersed after a cavalry charge and
                            several carbine volleys. A few minutes later another mob demonstration
                            was made in front of the residence of the premier, Mr. Theotaky, and
                            again the troops and gendarmes made use of their rifles to clear the
                            streets.</p>
                        <p>The casualties were as follows: Eight killed and upward of 60 wounded.
                            The dead bodies and 32 of the wounded were carried to the municipal
                            hospital. Probably as many more were wounded, but escaped
                            identification, as they were conveyed by friends to their respective
                            homes. That the casualties were not greater may be explained by the fact
                            that the soldiers were unquestionably in sympathy with the sentiments of
                            the rioters, and did not direct their fire upon the crowds, the
                            effective shooting being done by the police or gendarmes.</p>
                        <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0331"/>
                        <p>After a conference had been held during the night between King George and
                            the members of the ministry and prominent citizens, the resignation of
                            the Metropolitan, the titular head of the church in Greece, was accepted
                            at 4 o’clock this morning (November 22). By royal decree, signed at the
                            same hour, the director of police and the prefect of police were both
                            removed and their positions filled by new appointees. The Government
                            printing office issued an edition of the Official Gazette at 6 o’clock
                            a. m. containing the above announcements.</p>
                        <p>The burial of the victims of yesterday’s conflict took place this
                            afternoon. Many thousands of people followed the single funeral
                            procession to the cemetery, every shop in Athens was closed, and on all
                            sides profound regret and grief were expressed at the outcome of
                            yesterday’s tragedy.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that yesterday
                            priests read from every pulpit in Athens a decree of the Holy Synod
                            which prohibits, on pain of excommunication, the sale or reading of any
                            translation of the Bible.</p>
                        <p>This action was evidently taken by the religious authorities in order to
                            completely restore public confidence that no attempt to publish a vulgar
                            version of the Holy Scriptures will be tolerated by the Greek Church. It
                            will be recalled that this question precipitated a conflict in the
                            streets of Athens on November 21 ultimo between a mob of over 25,000
                            students and workmen and citizens and the Government troops, in which 8
                            persons were killed and over 60 wounded.</p>
                        <p>Several years ago Her Majesty Queen Olga, actuated by the best of
                            motives, published at her own expense a translation of the Bible in
                            common use (which is in the Greek of the Byzantine period) into the
                            modern language of Greece. It was not sold, but distributed free among
                            the hospitals and other charitable institutions of this city. While the
                            gracious act of Her Majesty did not meet with public favor, it has never
                            been alleged that the translator of that particular version of the Bible
                            employed any language which could be construed as vulgar. However, in
                            view of the action of the Holy Synod as above stated, this indirect
                            authoritative reflection by the Church of Greece on the act of Queen
                            Olga is likely to produce disagreeable complications.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I inclose herewith copy of a dispatch from
                            the consul-general at Guatemala City, together with its inclosures,
                            relating to the claim of Siegfried Koenigsberger for certain moneys
                            confiscated by the Guatemalan customs authorities, and for the annoyance
                            and losses attendant upon the action complained of. As nearly as the
                            Department can gather the facts in the case it appears:</p>
                        <p>That said Koenigsberger and his brother arrived at San José de Guatemala
                            from Guatemala City on December 7, 1899, holding checks for two valises
                            which arrived with them as baggage; that said valises were alleged to
                            contain $2,300 in silver; that Koenigsberger was called to the office of
                            the commandante of the port at about 9 o’clock in the evening, and upon
                            identifying the valises was commanded to open them, which he refused to
                            do, claiming that it was after business hours for the custom-house, and
                            further that as he still held the checks the valises were in the hands
                            of the railroad company; that on the following morning he was called
                            again to the office of the commandante and ordered to open the valises,
                            and upon his refusal he and his brother were imprisoned for about two
                            hours, when their release was secured by the United States consul; that
                            they were again summoned by the commandante, and in the presence of the
                            consul opened the valises, when, on counting the money, they discovered
                            a shortage of $508; which amount had been removed “without their
                            knowledge or consent;” that the remainder, $1,792, was taken by the
                            commandante and deposited in the mint, subject to the order of the
                            minister of finance; that on the following day, while they were
                            returning to Guatemala City, they were arrested by the chief of police
                            of Escuintla and there detained for twenty-four hours, then ordered back
                            to San José, still under arrest; but that on the way they received a
                            telegram signed by the president of the Republic which secured their
                            release.</p>
                        <p>It further appears that a presidential decree had been issued,
                            prohibiting the exportation of silver, but that said decree “has been
                            practically a dead letter, inasmuch as thousands of dollars weekly has
                            been exported by Government permission.”</p>
                        <p>From the facts as above related it would appear that for the money ($508)
                            abstracted while in possession of and in course of transportation by the
                            railroad company the remedy, if any, is against said company in the
                            courts. With regard to the remainder of the money, $1,792, <pb n="253"
                                xml:id="pg_253" facs="0333"/>which it is inferred was confiscated in
                            virtue of a law prohibiting the exportation of silver from the country,
                            it is the opinion of the Department that it was Koenigsberger’s duty,
                            when requested to do so, to submit the valises to the customs
                            authorities for the purpose of examining them to ascertain whether they
                            contained silver intended to be smuggled out of the country. The fact
                            that the Messrs. Koenigsberger had applied for permission to embark and
                            were about to leave the country and that the valises stood at the wharf
                            would appear to justify the inference of the officials that they were
                            about to take the valises, with their contents, from the country in
                            violation of law.</p>
                        <p>The consul-general reports that you are of opinion that the money was
                            unlawfully seized and should be returned to its owners. If you find that
                            the seizure and detention of the money are unlawful, you will bring the
                            matter to the attention of the Guatemalan Government and request the
                            prompt return of the money.</p>
                        <p>It is also stated in the consul-general’s report that the law against the
                            exportation of silver does not authorize imprisonment, but only
                            confiscation, as a penalty for smuggling. If this statement is accurate
                            you may report to the Department whether the Messrs. Koenigsberger have
                            an adequate remedy in damages before the local tribunals for such
                            unlawful arrest</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge
                                receipt of the Department’s No. 42<note n="a" xml:id="d240fna">Not
                                    printed.</note> of July 30, 1900, inclosing copy of a memorial
                                of Siegfried Koenigsberger preferring a claim against the Government
                                of Guatemala for $2,300 pesos silver alleged to have been
                                confiscated by the Guatemalan Government, and $5,000 United States
                                gold for damages said to have been sustained for loss of the use of
                                the money and annoyance and inconvenience suffered from false
                                imprisonment, and instructing me to make an investigation and
                                report.</p>
                            <p>Knowledge of this case first came to me through Minister Hunter, who
                                handed me the metal checks for valises left in his care by Siegfried
                                Koenigsberger, saying at the same time that this money must be
                                returned to the Koenigsbergers as the seizure was unlawful. This was
                                the day before the minister left this capital for the United States
                                on leave. I was under the impression that Minister Hunter had made
                                some representation to the Guatemalan Government, and therefore did
                                not consult the Government during my short season as chargé
                                d’affaires.</p>
                            <p>I beg to inclose letters from our former consular agent at San José
                                de Guatemala as well as from former employees of the railroad and
                                Agencia Maritima, etc., at San José.</p>
                            <p>A presidential decree was promulgated prohibiting the exportation of
                                silver, which decree has been practically a dead letter, inasmuch as
                                    <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0334"/>thousands of dollars
                                weekly has been exported by Government permission. I am not aware of
                                any penalty attached to the decree other than the confiscation of
                                the silver. The arrest of the Koenigsbergers was fully unwarranted
                                and in no sense according to the provision of the decree in
                                question. I am not informed as to the reasons the authorities
                                advance for their arrest. That they were arrested and confined in
                                jail in Escuintla and there detained for twenty-four hours can not
                                be disputed. The two valises in question were checked in Guatemala
                                in a manner indicating that they were to be taken on board the
                                steamer, as is usual with all baggage checked to the pier, and yet
                                it does seem singular that the Koenigsbergers, having full knowledge
                                of the decree against the exportation of silver, and knowing full
                                well the vigilance of the customs authorities in this regard, would
                                attempt to carry out in two valises $2,300 in silver, which in no
                                event could pass the officials, the weight readily indicating the
                                contents.</p>

                                    <p>“In reply to your favor of the 19th of January regarding the
                                        seizure of valises belonging to Koenigsberger, the facts, as
                                        far as I have been able to obtain them, are as follows: The
                                        valises were checked from Guatemala to the port, and on the
                                        arrival of the baggage on the outer end of the pier the
                                        valises with the checks still attached were taken by the
                                        comandante. My first information of the affair was on the
                                        following morning, when I received a request from
                                        Koenigsberger to call on him at the comandancia, where he
                                        was detained. I secured his release on my promise to produce
                                        him when wanted.</p>
                                    <p>“About noon of the same day I was requested by the comandante
                                        to be present at the opening of the valises. The owners were
                                        also there, and in order to prevent the locks from being
                                        broken opened them under protest.</p>

                            <p>As the people in the railroad and on the pier have been changed, I
                                can get no further information there. The factor of the company says
                                that the Koenigsbergers were not on the pier to embark when the
                                baggage was seized. They had applied for their permission to embark,
                                but had not actually received it. I believe the Government claim
                                that as evidence that they were about to embark.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In December, 1899, I was agent for the
                                Guatemala Central Railroad Company, being in charge of the station
                                at San José. On the 8th of December a gentleman named Koenigsberger
                                presented two baggage checks, claiming his baggage, which was
                                checked at Guatemala the day before. The numbers on the checks
                                indicated that the baggage had been checked direct to the end of the
                                pier, and I told Mr. Koenigsberger that he would find his baggage on
                                the pier. He then left, but returned in <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255"
                                    facs="0335"/>about an hour saying that his baggage was not on
                                the pier; that he had been informed that it had been seized by the
                                comandante, and that as it was in the care of the railroad company
                                and he held their checks, he wanted me to get his baggage. I told
                                him that while it was true that the railroad company had checked his
                                baggage, it had not been checked to San José station, but to the end
                                of the pier, and had been delivered to the Agenda Maritima direct by
                                the train baggagemaster without even passing through my hands, and
                                that I could do nothing at all; he would have to present his checks
                                to that company, who had received the baggage from the railroad
                                company. He did this, but could not recover his baggage, as it had
                                been seized by officials of the Government</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I saw and talked with the
                                Koenigsberger brothers on the train from San José de Guatemala to
                                Escuintla on or about the 7th day of December, 1899. They related to
                                me the circumstances of their arrest, and said they intended putting
                                the matter in the hands of the American minister immediately upon
                                their arrival in Guatemala.</p>
                            <p>I left the train at Escuintla, and before leaving the station I saw
                                them taken off the train by policemen and conducted to jail. I
                                afterwards saw them in jail at Escuintla, and at their earnest
                                request endeavored to help them out of their predicament, but failed
                                to do them any good. They were in jail from about 11.30 o’clock a.
                                m., December 9 or 10, until 11.30 o’clock the next day. I saw them
                                at the train the next day under police guard. They told me they were
                                to be taken back to San José de Guatemala, but before the train left
                                the station at Escuintla, they were taken off and conducted away by
                                policemen.</p>
                            <p>I did not know them prior to their trouble and have never talked to

                                that I write you what I know of the taking of silver from the
                                Koenigsberger brothers on the night of December 7, 1899, I give the
                                following as my part in the affair: On the night in question I was
                                on the pier assisting in the embarking of passengers and baggage for
                                the steamer which was to sail that night, when the chief of the
                                police at San José came to me with an aide and demanded the delivery
                                of two valises, bearing railroad strap-checks, and which I happened
                                to know belonged to the Messrs. Koenigsberger. I refused the
                                delivery, saying that the agencia company was responsible for
                                baggage bearing checks, and that we could only deliver on
                                presentation of corresponding checks, but added that if an order to
                                deliver from the comandante of the port relieving us from all
                                responsibility was presented to the factor of the Agencia Maritima
                                Nacional Limitada, he would in all probability order the packages to
                                be delivered to the comandante.</p>
                            <p>The police representative left to secure the order, and I reported
                                the matter to the factor. Later I was told by the factor that the
                                comandante had arranged the matter, and that the baggage had been
                                delivered to him.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your request directed to
                                me personally yesterday for a statement of my recollections of the
                                facts in the case relating to the silver coin taken from the
                                Koenigsberger brothers at the port of San José de Guatemala in
                                December, 1899, by the authorities of the Guatemalan Government, I
                                beg to submit below my recollections of the case.</p>
                            <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0336"/>
                            <p>The morning following the seizure of the silver coin I was sent for
                                by the Koenigsberger brothers, who were detained as prisoners at the
                                comandancia, asking me to come and see them and endeavor to secure
                                their release, which” I succeeded in doing by application to the
                                comandante of the port, Don Salvador R. Cabrera.</p>
                            <p>After the release of the elder Mr. Koenigsberger, who exhibited
                                papers certifying that he was an American citizen, he personally
                                made the statement to me that two valises had been forcibly seized
                                by the comandante of the port on the evening previous, and that said
                                valises were his property; that they contained silver coin amounting
                                to something over $2,000 in silver coinage of the republics of Peru,
                                Chili, and Guatemala. He further stated that these valises
                                containing said coin were checked by the Guatemala Central Railway
                                Company, said checks being in their possession and duplicates on
                                valises. That the seizure was made directly from that company, he
                                not having surrendered the duplicate checks, and furthermore that he
                                had not endeavored or at any time attempted to export said coin, and
                                requested that the valises should be delivered to himself.
                                Notwithstanding said personal request, the comandante of the port
                                took the two valises into his possession and retained the same until
                                the following morning, and also, he stated, the comandante still
                                retained the same.</p>
                            <p>Some time after the release of Koenigsberger I received a written
                                request from the comandante to call at his office at noon relative
                                to the case. This I did, Mr. Koenigsberger and his brother and some
                                eight or ten persons more being present, most of whom were employees
                                of the Government of the port of San José, such as secretaries and
                                clerks. The comandante then had brought the two valises to the
                                office and told Mr. Koenigsberger to open them, which Mr.
                                Koenigsberger refused to do. The comandante then ordered them broken
                                open; whereupon Mr. Koenigsberger, protesting, proceeded to open
                                them with his keys.</p>
                            <p>My remembrance now is that the Government officials proceeded to take
                                all the articles out of the two valises, collecting all the coined
                                silver, which amounted to something over $1,800, which was placed
                                upon the comandante’s desk and there counted. After this he remained
                                in possession of the silver, returning the valises and other
                                articles taken from them to Mr. Koenigsberger. This coin was
                                retained by the comandante against the protest of both Mr.
                                Koenigsberger and myself, and presumably on the grounds that it had
                                been the intention of Mr. Koenigsberger to export the silver, though
                                this last was denied by Mr. Koenigsberger.</p>
                            <p>The next day I had occasion to go to Guatemala City. On the same
                                train were Siegfried Koenigsberger and his brother. When the train
                                arrived at Escuintla the authorities entered the train and arrested
                                both, taking them to the jail at Escuintla. On arriving in the city
                                I immediately notified the United States minister, W. Godfrey
                                Hunter.</p>

                            299, of November 27, 1900, with inclosures as stated, relating to the
                            claim of Siegfried Koenigsberger for certain moneys confiscated by the
                            Guatemala customs authorities and for the annoyance and loss attendant
                            upon the action complained of, I have the honor to submit the following
                            report:</p>
                        <p>It appears that Gustave and Siegfried Koenigsberger, who are brothers,
                            the former a German subject and the latter a naturalized American
                            citizen, have been for the past ten years engaged as partners in the
                            broker business in this city.</p>
                        <p>On the morning of December 7, 1899, these men left here on the Guatemala
                            Central Railroad for the port of San José, on the Pacific coast of this
                            Republic, having checked their two valises as baggage through to the
                            pier of said port. On their arrival there in the afternoon they applied
                            for permission to embark on the steamer leaving <pb n="257"
                                xml:id="pg_257" facs="0337"/>that evening for Salvador, and having
                            identified their valises, which stood at the end of the pier ready for
                            embarkation, in accordance with instructions given when same were
                            checked in Guatemala City, they were requested by the customs
                            authorities to open them, in order to ascertain whether they contained
                            silver intended to be smuggled from the country. As they refused to
                            comply with this request, they were taken ashore with their valises and
                            detained in the office of the comandante, where, next morning, December
                            8, 1899, in the presence of the Messrs. Koenigsberger and our consular
                            agent, Mr. Upton Lorentz, the valises were opened under protest and
                            found to contain $1,792 in silver coins of Guatemala, Peru, and Chile,
                            there being a shortage, according to the claims of the Messrs.
                            Koenigsberger, of $508, as they affirmed that the valises had contained
                            $2,300. The amount found, $1,792, however, was confiscated by the
                            authorities, and an investigation ordered with the view of instituting
                            criminal proceedings against the Koenigsberger brothers, who that
                            morning were released under promise of our consular agent to produce
                            them when needed.</p>
                        <p>On being released the Messrs. Koenigsberger, without permission from the
                            local authorities, took the first train for Guatemala City, in company
                            with Mr. Lorentz, but were intercepted at Escuintla, where they were
                            arrested and detained twenty-four hours and then ordered back to the
                            port. This order was about to be put into execution when, just as they
                            reached the railroad station en route for the port, they were liberated
                            by virtue of a telegraphic order from the President, which I had secured
                            on the representations of our consular agent, who had arrived in this
                            city the previous evening.</p>
                        <p>A few days after these occurrences the Messrs. Koenigsberger came to this
                            legation to thank me for their prompt release and to complain of the
                            alleged unlawful seizure of their silver at the railroad depot,
                            exhibiting at the same time two metal checks of the Guatemala Central
                            Railroad as proof that the two valises had been seized while in the care
                            of the said railroad.</p>
                        <p>In response to their request I brought the matter to the attention of the
                            minister of foreign affairs, who promised an investigation and report at
                            an early date; but before receiving his promised note I left my post for
                            the United States on leave, and among the matters of unfinished business
                            which I left in the hands of Mr. McNally, chargé d’affaires, was this
                            case.</p>
                        <p>On my return I found that nothing had been done in the matter, and the
                            Messrs. Koenigsberger again having asked my aid in securing the return
                            of their silver, I took the matter up anew, and on investigation
                            discovered for the first time that one of the brothers, Gustave, was a
                            German subject and that he had laid the case before the German minister,
                            who, on hearing the facts, refused to take any action in the matter.</p>
                        <p>About the same time also Mr. P. Dalgliesh, a British subject, had a sum
                            of $13,000 confiscated, which he was attempting to smuggle out in the
                            same way, and had laid his case before the British minister, who also
                            refused to uphold him in the matter.</p>
                        <p>By way of further comparison of similar cases, I should say that the case
                            of $3,000 taken from a Chinaman at Champerico was different, in that the
                            money was seized at the railroad depot before same had been transferred
                            to the pier, and that for this reason I was able to secure its return,
                            as the grounds for suspicion were much less. In the present <pb n="258"
                                xml:id="pg_258" facs="0338"/>case, on the contrary, I found upon
                            investigation that the valises had reached the end of the pier, where
                            nothing is ever taken except such things as are intended to go aboard
                            the steamer. I should perhaps explain here that the pier at San José is
                            not in the hands of the railroad company, but is a separate corporation,
                            and is a structure some 900 feet long, extending out from the beach into
                            the deep water of the ocean beyond the breakers, and from the extreme
                            end of which all passengers, baggage, and freight must be transferred to
                            steamers by means of small launches. Anything, therefore, which is sent
                            out to the end of the pier is presumably for exportation, and in the
                            present case this presumption is so strong that no other view can be
                            reasonably taken of it except that it was the intention of the Messrs.
                            Koenigsberger to smuggle out the silver contained in their valises.</p>
                        <p>While the general merits of this case will be apparent from the foregoing
                            narrative, I beg to mention in a specific way the following points: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The belief that it was the intention of the Koenigsbergers to
                                    smuggle out of the country the $2,300 which they affirm to have
                                    carried in their valises is greatly strengthened by their
                                    confession of their full intention to embark, by their having
                                    checked their baggage to the point of the pier, which is only
                                    done when such baggage is intended to go aboard, and by their
                                    refusal to exhibit the contents of their baggage when requested
                                    to do so.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>That the action of the authorities in the confiscation of the
                                    silver and arrest of the Koenigsberger brothers was entirely
                                    within the scope of the law, as will be seen from the law
                                    itself, translations of extracts from which are hereto attached,
                                    marked “1,” “2,” “3,” and “4.”</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The assertion that the law relative to the exportation of
                                    silver was a dead letter is, I think, fully controverted by the
                                    fact of the very existence of the present case, with its
                                    accompanying facts and circumstances, as well as those of Mr.
                                    Dalgliesh and the Chinaman referred to.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that Siegfried
                            Koenigsberger has no ground of complaint, that he is not entitled to
                            recover the silver confiscated, and that he may consider himself
                            fortunate in having escaped penal proceedings, to which he was
                            liable.</p>

                                and December last were given out, authorizing the banks to stop the

                                exporters of said metal, it will bring upon the country an indigence

                                realize their assets, must necessarily protect themselves against
                                possible difficulties, it is reasonable that they should hold their

                                giving rise to the danger that to the scarcity of the notes now
                                being used as a medium of exchange will be added the lack of the

                            investigation of the claim of Siegfried Koenigsberger against Guatemala
                            for certain moneys belonging to him and his brother confiscated by the
                            Guatemalan customs authorities, and for the annoyance and loss attendant
                            upon the action complained of.</p>
                        <p>You express the opinion that Koenigsberger has no ground of complaint,
                            that he is not entiled to recover the silver confiscated, and that he
                            may consider himself fortunate in having escaped penal proceedings to
                            which he was liable.</p>
                        <p>The Department concurs in your conclusion. Accordingly a letter has been

                            that he has no just ground for complaint.</p>

                        <p>John D. Metzger &amp; Co., through the State Department at Washington,
                            presented against the Republic of Haiti three separate claims which are
                            the subject-matter of the arbitration, claiming indemnity on account of
                            the alleged liability of the Republic of Haiti for a quantity of lumber
                            alleged to have been sold by them to the relief committee on the
                            occasion of the devastation by fire of the city of Jacmel; also on
                            account of the alleged failure to furnish them an adequate, supply of
                            water for the operation of their mill at Port au Prince; also on account
                            of the seizure and sale of their goods at Port au Prince for nonpayment
                            of license taxes. I shall now proceed to consider these cases in the
                            order named.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">lumber claim.</hi></p>
                        <p>This claim arises from an undertaking on the part of the firm of John D.
                            Metzger &amp; Co. to furnish lumber for the inhabitants of the city of
                            Jacmel. This city was devastated by fire in the fall of 1896, a large
                            part thereof being destroyed. A relief committee was assembled on the
                            20th day of November, 1896, to consider methods of relief, in view of
                            the fact that the Government of Haiti had indicated its purpose to allow
                            the sum of $20,000 for the relief of the people. Prior to the assembling
                            of this relief committee the firm of Metzger &amp; Co. had proposed to
                            furnish lumber to be distributed among the needy <pb n="265"
                                xml:id="pg_265" facs="0345"/>people of Jacmel to the amount of the
                            proposed appropriation. The relief committee, composed of eight
                            citizens, took action upon this proposal, as is evidenced in the
                            following minute or memorandum: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    for the purpose of taking cognizance of a letter addressed to

                                    wish to invest the $20,000 (gourdes) appropriated (“votées”) by
                                    the Government in favor of the homeless (“sinistres”) of Jacmel,
                                    in building material.</p>
                                <p>Upon lecture of said letter the members of the relief committee
                                    have spoken, one after the other, of the importance and the
                                    advisability of the proposition of Mr. Craft, and have finally
                                    adopted the offer made to them to import from the United States
                                    building material for him to hold at the disposition of the
                                    relief committee at the rate of 35 gourdes per thousand and to

                                    (“accordés”) the population to their relief, and which building
                                    materials must be held in yard (“depot”) to the disposal of said

                        <p>It thus appears that the relief committee provisionally accepted the
                            offer of Metzger &amp; Co. to furnish material to be held at the
                            disposition of the relief committee, to be furnished at the rate of 35
                            gourdes per thousand to the amount of $20,000. This arrangement was not
                            entered into, however, for the purpose of binding the committee either
                            personally or as a committee. It was to be the basis of a contract with
                            the Government, to which the minute recites the “decision” shall be
                            submitted for its sanction and to arrange with the house of Metzger
                            &amp; Co. for the mode of payment. Metzger &amp; Co., recognizing this
                            purpose in the action of the committee, on the 7th of December, 1896,
                            submitted to the secretary of state of the department of the interior of
                            Haiti a copy of the foregoing minute soliciting the Government’s

                            transaction with the relief committee. The material has been ordered and
                            has arrived. Metzger &amp; Co. express their desire to make delivery

                        <p>In this letter it will be observed there is no denial of Metzger &amp;
                            Co.’s statement that the council of ministers had sanctioned the
                            arrangement with the Jacmel relief committee; but the secretary suggests
                            his inability to raise more than $5,000 for Metzger &amp; Co. This
                            letter may be taken fairly as an admission that the council of ministers
                            had approved of the arrangement made by the relief committee, which was
                            only to be binding on the Government when thus authenticated by it.</p>
                        <p>In the affidavit of John D. Metzger, filed with the claim in the State
                            Department, it is said “that the Government of Haiti has become a
                            guarantor and principal in the transaction related in the ‘process
                            verbal’ of the Jacmel relief committee, dated November 23, 1896, by
                            indorsing and accepting the same purely and simply, and that the
                            minister of the interior then in office had given the deponent verbal
                            notice of such acceptance or indorsement, and that the notice was
                            corroborated by the then minister of finance, Mr. C. Fouchard, to the
                                <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0347"/>deponent. What then was the
                            arrangement thus adopted by the council? It was that $20,000 worth of
                            lumber at a fixed price should be delivered for the relief of the
                            inhabitants of Jacmel.</p>
                        <p>It does not appear that the part of the “process verbal” which required
                            the mode of payment for lumber furnished to be determined between
                            Metzger &amp; Co. and the Government had been the subject of negotiation
                            and settlement. It was not stated in the preliminary arrangement that
                            the material was to be paid for in cash upon delivery. The provision
                            that the mode of payment should be determined between the Government and
                            Metzger &amp; Co. is strongly indicative of the intention to obtain
                            terms of payment of a different character. In any event and for whatever
                            reason the “process verbal” reserved to the Government the right to
                            negotiate with Metzger &amp; Co. terms of payment which should be
                            mutually satisfactory. There is nothing in the testimony or
                            correspondence to indicate that this important element of the proposed
                            contract had been the subject of negotiation and settlement between the
                            parties. When the matter was taken up an arrangement was effected by
                            which $5,000 worth of building material was to be delivered to the
                            relief committee upon the payment of $5,000. The committee, however,
                            declined to receive the building material unless officially advised so
                            to do by the Government, as appears in its note of February 6, 1897, to
                            Metzger &amp; Co. This instruction seems to have been refused by the
                            department of the interior, and on the 10th day of February, 1897,
                            Metzger &amp; Co. addressed the following communication to the secretary
                            of state of finance and commerce: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary of State</hi>: We announce to
                                    you with regret that our efforts (demarches) near your colleague
                                    of the department of the interior have remained fruitless, he
                                    refusing to give us the letter demanded by the relief committee
                                    of Jacmel under the plea that there is an understanding between
                                    you and ourselves that we should deliver for $20,000 of material
                                    before we could collect $5,000.</p>
                                <p>As you well know, this is a profound mistake, no affair of credit
                                    having been agreed upon between us. Our agreement was that we
                                    should deliver for $5,000 lumber against $5,000 cash down and
                                    that we were to enter upon arrangements for the balance.</p>
                                <p>Requesting you kindly to enter into communication with your
                                    colleague of the interior, and regulate the conditions taken, we
                                    are, Mr. Secretary of State,</p>

                        <p>In this letter we find the first evidence that the matter of the mode of
                            payment had been the subject of consideration and determination between
                            the Government and Metzger &amp; Co. In this letter Metzer &amp; Co.
                            say: “Our agreement was that we should deliver $5,000 worth of lumber
                            against $5,000 cash down and we were to enter into agreement for the
                            balance.” To this letter no reply appears to have been made and it may
                            fairly be taken as stating the arrangement so far as definitely
                            concluded. There is the distinct admission on the part of Metzger &amp;
                            Co. that arrangements are still to be made as to the mode of payment for
                            the balance of the lumber. As we have seen, Metzger &amp; Co. have
                            advised the Jacmel relief committee of their willingness to furnish
                            $5,000 worth of lumber for $5,000 in cash, which proposition the relief
                            committee declined to accept without the sanction of the Government. It
                            is apparent from the testimony and documents in evidence that the
                            difference which arose between Metzger &amp; Co. and the Government as
                            to the terms and mode of payment was never reconciled <pb n="268"
                                xml:id="pg_268" facs="0348"/>and no further definite agreement was
                            concluded between the parties interested. It is to be gathered from the
                            documents and correspondence that Metzger &amp; Co., owing to their
                            distrust arising from the unsettled condition of affairs in Haiti,
                            deemed it imprudent to furnish the lumber except for cash, and the
                            Government’s declination to receive the same except upon credit led to
                            an irreconcilable difference upon this branch of the proposed contract,
                            upon which the minds of the parties never met on a common basis.</p>
                        <p>In reaching this conclusion I have not overlooked the fact that when
                            demand for payment from the officials of the Government of Haiti was
                            made, the answer of the Government based the denial of liability upon
                            other grounds than lack of agreement with Metzger &amp; Co. as to the
                            mode of payment. Upon October 6, 1897, Metzger &amp; Co. wrote to the
                            Government officials asking payment for the amount of lumber tendered
                            the Jacmel relief committee. It was answered November 13, 1897, by the
                            secretary of state of the department of the interior, calling for
                            documentary proof showing that the lumber had been placed to the account
                            of the Government. A letter is in evidence, dated June 30, 1898, from
                            Hon. T. August, then secretary of state of the interior, in which the
                            receipt of the letter of Metzger &amp; Co. of the 6th instant, inclosing
                            copy of the minute of the relief committee, and from the minister of the
                            interior, above referred to, is acknowledged. In this letter Mr. August
                            states that the council decided that the claim can not be considered,
                            nothing having been furnished to the population of Jacmel. It must be
                            borne in mind, as shown in the statement of Metger &amp; Co., filed in
                            the State Department, that four changes of ministers intervened during
                            the time which Metzger &amp; Co. were pressing their claim for
                            settlement. These denials of liability, under the circumstances, I deem
                            consistent with the other proof, which shows that the council of
                            ministers had approved of the arrangement with the relief committee,
                            which left open the manner in which the $20,000 was to be paid. But no
                            agreement was reached further than herein indicated upon this subject.
                            Upon consideration of all of the documents in evidence submitted I have
                            reached the conclusion that the Government did definitely agree and bind
                            itself through its proper officers to take $5,000 worth of lumber; that
                            Metzger &amp; Co. tendered delivery of this material; that the
                            Government refused to pay said sum, and that the relief committee
                            declined to receive the same without instructions and sanction of the
                            Government. Therefore there was a breach of contract entitling Metzger
                            &amp; Co. to $5,000 in consideration of that much worth of lumber. As
                            the result of this default Metzger &amp; Co. were compelled to dispose
                            of said lumber at a great sacrifice. Owing to the conditions of affairs
                            in Jacmel it was almost impossible to sell the lumber there. I find the
                            loss of Metzger &amp; Co. because of this contract to be the difference
                            between the price agreed upon and the price obtainable in the market at
                            the time and place of delivery, namely, $3,000, which sum, in my
                            opinion, is justly due from the Republic of Haiti to Metzger &amp;
                            Co.</p>
                        <p>As to the objection interposed by complainant to certain testimony
                            offered by the government of Haiti, to wit, pieces numbered 14 to 27,
                            inclusive, which bear date as of October, 1898, I have concluded to
                            consider said testimony for whatever weight I consider it justly
                            entitled. In my opinion it is not decisive of the real issues in the
                            case, as it tends to show that the relief committee did not make any
                            contract binding <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0349"/>upon the
                            committee. The real question to be determined is, How far did the
                            government of Haiti make itself liable under the circumstances shown? I
                            have, therefore, given this testimony due consideration and declined to
                            exclude it as requested by counsel for the claimant.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">water claim.</hi></p>
                        <p>Metzger &amp; Co., having established a business as dealers in lumber and
                            erected a planing mill in connection therewith, in the fall of 1897,
                            discovered that the supply of water furnished by the hydraulic service
                            at Port au Prince was inadequate, and they were not able to obtain water
                            enough for their mill. The mill had theretofore been supplied with a
                            three-quarter inch pipe. Metzger &amp; Co. made application for a 1-inch
                            pipe. This application was entertained by the local authorities, and an
                            agreement was reached with Metzger &amp; Co. by which their firm was to
                            pay for obtaining the pipe and the cost of laying same. The work was
                            estimated to cost $81.75. This estimate was accepted by Mr. Metzger and
                            indorsed “Approved. Good for $81.75.” It is claimed that Metzger &amp;
                            Co. refused to pay this sum. I find, however, from the testimony
                            submitted, that the mayor of the commune in a report to the minister of
                            foreign affairs of Haiti, stated that he had agreed to make compensation
                            for the $81.75 on a sum of $218 on a debt due Metzger &amp; Co. from the
                            commune, which the mayor alleges Metzger &amp; Co. refused to do. This
                            claim, however, is inconsistent with the acceptance of the bill indorsed
                            by Metzger &amp; Co., with approval as above quoted, and with the fact
                            that the commune was embarrassed in the payment of its debts, and
                            Metzger &amp; Co. are likely to have been entirely willing to obtain
                            part of their claim from the commune in this way. The testimony is clear
                            that Metzger &amp; Co. badly needed the water, without which they could
                            not run their mill, the lack of it greatly interfering with their
                            business and practically bringing it to a standstill. It is
                            inconceivable that they would not permit a credit of such a small sum
                            upon their claim to enable them to obtain the much-needed water supply.
                            I am of opinion that this arrangement for the furnishing of water was
                            entered into between Metzger &amp; Co. and the local authorities and
                            should have been carried out in good faith. It appears that this work
                            was begun but was stopped by the communal magistrate, who informed
                            Metzger &amp; Co. that unless they paid certain license taxes a 1-inch
                            pipe could not be laid, but a one-half inch pipe, which had already
                            proved inadequate, would be supplied. Metzger &amp; Co. claimed that the
                            license taxes could not be paid by reason of certain orders of the local
                            courts undertaking to subject the same to payment of creditors of the
                            commune. I do not deem it important in this connection to enter upon the
                            merits of that controversy. I am satisfied that the payment of license
                            taxes had nothing to do with the furnishing of a water supply to Metzger
                            &amp; Co. This demand was probably an afterthought, improperly
                            introduced into the affair, and could have no effect in releasing the
                            authorities from their contract. It also appears that it was claimed
                            that Metzger &amp; Co. were in arrears for water rent. This is
                            contradicted by receipts in evidence in the case. No such claim was made
                            when the contract was entered into with Metzger &amp; Co. for a 1–inch
                            pipe. If such a claim could have been made, it should have been insisted
                            upon at the time. As to the alleged offers to carry out the agreement,
                            it does not <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0350"/>appear that upon
                            the occasion of Mr. Metheun’s visit to Metzger &amp; Co.’s works in 1898
                            he offered to carry out the agreement, which had in fact been made, but
                            only to repair the insufficient service, already in at Metzger &amp;
                            Co.’s expense. Reference is made in the brief fried in behalf of the
                            Republic of Haiti to a private letter of one Hilaire, an attorney, to
                            the mayor of the commune. Hilaire is said to have been the attorney of
                            Metzger &amp; Co. It is of date of June 17, and he says “they (Metzger
                            &amp; Co.) refused to accept the mode of payment proposed by you
                            (Mathon) based as you say on the compensation.” No doubt this referred
                            to the offer of Metheun to repair the pipes at Metzger &amp; Co.’s
                            expense. It was not a tender or promise to furnish a 1-inch pipe or such
                            a promise as would put an end to liability under the contract. As I have
                            already found, Metzger &amp; Co. practically agreed to pay the cost by
                            crediting the sum of $81.75 on the amount of $218 due from the commune.
                            It only remained for the latter to lay the pipes as agreed. On October
                            10, 1898, Mr. Hay advised the American charge of affairs at Port au
                            Prince that in an interview with the solicitor of the State Department
                            the Haitian minister had said that the commune would furnish the water
                            pipe for Metzger &amp; Co. provided they consent that the cost thereof
                            be credited on the amount of $218 due Metzger &amp; Co. by the commune.
                            The Secretary advised that Metzger &amp; Co. give their consent and
                            offer in writing to pay for the cost in the manner proposed, at the same
                            time not waiving any claim they might have because of the refusal
                            theretofore to furnish them with an adequate supply of water. Mr.
                            Powell, the American minister, took up the matter on that line and
                            reported, on January 17, 1899, that the council of ministers had agreed
                            to adjust the matter, leaving Metzger &amp; Co. in a position to claim
                            damages for any failure of the water supply theretofore. It appears from
                            the diplomatic correspondence that the attention of the Haitian minister
                            at Washington having been called to the claim of Metzger and Co., as to
                            the inadequate water supply for the mill, the minister at once gave
                            assurances that Metzger &amp; Co.’s grievances in that behalf should be
                            adjusted on an equitable basis. On the 3d of June, 1898, Mr. Léger, the
                            minister of Haiti at Washington, in answer to a note from the Secretary
                            of State of the United States advising the minister that the minister of
                            the United States at Port au Prince reported Metzer &amp; Co.’s mill
                            still deprived of water, said, in his note: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>In reply, I must not fail to confirm what I had the honor to
                                    state to you in an interview of the 2d instant. According to the
                                    agreement reached with the solicitor of the Department, I
                                    informed my Government of Mr. Metzger’s grievances, and the
                                    secretary of state of foreign relations recently wrote to me
                                    that the matter had been settled within twenty-four hours.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Afterwards the attention of the minister of Haiti at Washington being
                            called to this agreement, he assured the State Department that it had
                            been attended to for some time. An investigation shows that the
                            honorable minister was laboring under a misapprehension in this regard.
                            A visit was made to the Metzger establishment by the mayor of the
                            commune, who reported that water was furnished to the satisfaction of
                            Mr. Metzger. Doubtless this report misled the minister. An investigation
                            made by Minister Powell shows that there was very little water and the
                            supply at that time was entirely inadequate. Until January, 1899, no
                            successful attempt was made to carry out the contract. I am of opinion
                            that this arrangement agreeing to settle <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271"
                                facs="0351"/>Metzger &amp; Co.’s grievances, promptly accepted by
                            the secretary of state for foreign relations of Haiti, followed by the
                            assurance of the secretary, conveyed by the minister to the State
                            Department at Washington, that the matter had been settled within
                            twenty-four hours, constituted a diplomatic agreement between the two
                            countries which, upon settled principles of international law, should
                            have been carried into effect. It is claimed, on the part of the
                            Government of Haiti, that this correspondence amounted only to an
                            agreement on the part of Haiti to use its good offices with the commune
                            of Port au Prince. I am of opinion that it amounted to much more than
                            that. When the grievance was called to the attention of the minister at
                            Washington, and through him reported to the secretary, no claim was made
                            that the commune alone was responsible, and no attempt was made to limit
                            the authority or responsibility of the Government. On the contrary, the
                            minister and secretary promptly assumed responsibility for the grievance
                            and assured the Government at Washington that it had been rectified. It
                            can not be that good faith is less obligatory upon nations than upon
                            individuals in carrying out agreements. It is now strenuously urged that
                            the Government of Haiti had no authority over the commune of Port au
                            Prince, and must, in its relations with the commune, have limited its
                            interference to friendly advice and suggestions. I do not understand
                            that the limitations upon official authority, undisclosed at the time to
                            the other government, prevent the enforcement of diplomatic agreements.
                            The question came before the Chilian claims commission created by the
                            convention of August 7, 1892, between the United States and Chile, in
                            which a claim was made upon a contract entered into by the United States
                            minister in Chile, in making which the Government of the United States
                            claimed the minister had no authority and denied responsibility,
                            claiming further that the agreement was in violation of the statutes of
                            the United States, and that the plaintiff had a remedy in the United
                            States courts. The commission decided unanimously that it was immaterial
                            whether the minister had exceeded his authority or not, as he had made
                            the promise as the representative of the United States in the name of
                            his Government, which, according to the rules of responsibility of
                            governments for acts performed by their agents in foreign countries, can
                            not be repudiated. In the present case there is no claim that the
                            minister was unauthorized to make the diplomatic representations stated.
                            On the contrary, he was only carrying into effect the instructions of
                            his Government. The learned commission referred, in support of their
                            decision, to Calvo Dictionaire de Droit International, Volume II, page
                            170, and Calvo Dictionaire International, Volume I, section 417; Moore’s
                            Digest International Arbitration, volume 4, pages 3569–3571. Nor is
                            there any more avail in the argument that the remedy of Metzger &amp;
                            Co. is to be sought in the courts of Haiti against the commune. Even had
                            Metzger &amp; Co. such a right, this would not affect the right to
                            arbitrate the claim as has been done in this case. By the terms of the
                            protocol the arbitrator is competent to take jurisdiction of the claim
                            so far as the liability of the Government of Haiti is concerned (4 Moore
                            International Arbitrations, p. 3571). This view of the case renders it
                            unnecessary to determine whether, as is claimed in argument, the
                            communal authorities are merely the agents of Haiti or whether, as
                            contended by the minister of Haiti, the Government of Haiti had entirely
                            made over the waterworks to Port au <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272"
                                facs="0352"/>Prince, which alone received the revenues and managed
                            its affairs. A diplomatic arrangement fairly and honorably entered into
                            should, in my judgment, be carried into effect. I have already stated
                            what, in my opinion, were the rights of Metzger &amp; Co. under the
                            arrangements made with the commune to supply them with water. This is
                            the arrangement which should have been carried into effect. It should
                            have been carried out by the Government of Haiti upon the responsibility
                            assumed by it. Because of the failure to give them an adequate supply of
                            water Metzger &amp; Co’s, mill was compelled to remain idle, partially
                            for a time and afterwards to entirely suspend operations. Much of the
                            claim for alleged damages on behalf of complainant can not be allowed.
                            The items showing remote and speculative damages do not directly result
                            from the breach of the agreement. The claimants are entitled to
                            compensation for loss of the use of the mill in whole or in part during
                            the time in which they were unable to operate it by reason of the
                            failure to furnish water and its impaired usefulness when an inadequate
                            supply was furnished to them. I am of opinion that damages fairly
                            recoverable in a case of this kind will be compensated by the payment to
                            Metzger &amp; Co. by the Government of Haiti of the sum of $15,000.</p>

                        <p>J. D. Metzger &amp; Co., prior to January 6, 1897, having established a
                            business in the manufacture of doors, sashes, etc., in a planing mill
                            owned by them in Port au Prince, were engaged in carrying on the
                            business, with certain workmen in their employ. On that date several
                            writs were left at the mill for five workmen to appear before a justice
                            of the peace at Port au Prince to pay a year’s license, also certain
                            fines and costs for nonpayment thereof. The amount of the sentences thus
                            imposed vary in amount as to the different workmen, from $86 to $97.
                            These workmen were summoned to appear June 1, 1897. The proceedings
                            against them were on the ground that they were foreigners employed as
                            engineers or clerks. No attention seems to have been paid to these
                            proceedings. On the 16th of June the substitutes of the justice of the
                            peace, a “huissier,” and others appeared upon the premises of Metzger
                            &amp; Co., claiming judgment by default against the workmen. On June 23
                            the parties again appeared demanding payment of the assessments
                            aforesaid. The same being refused, the goods of Metzger &amp; Co. were
                            seized on the 23d, 24th, and 25th days of June, 1897, and taken from the
                            premises, and, after outcry, an auction being proclaimed and a bell
                            sounded by the crier, goods to the amount and value of $1,200 were sold,
                            although a much less sum was realized therefor, and certain receipts
                            were left at the factory for the license fees, fines, and costs levied
                            upon the workmen, to wit: <table rows="6" cols="2"

                            without delay any infraction of the present law, that they may have
                            discovered or that may have been denounced to them.”</p>
                        <p>Article 35 provides that “all fines pronounced either by the justices of
                            the peace or the correctional court, for an infraction of the present
                            law, belongs one-half to the one who shall have discovered or denounced
                            the violation and the other half to the communal funds.”</p>
                        <p>Metzger &amp; Co. strongly protested against this seizure and sale of
                            their property, claiming that the practice had not been to impose fines
                            for nonpayment of licenses; that none of the summonses, writs, or
                            judgments had been recorded, rendering the proceedings null and void;
                            that the seizures are unlawful, being the result of proceedings to which
                            Metzger &amp; Co. were not parties; that articles 11 and 18 of the law
                            of October 24, 1876, have only been applied to foreign clerks. It does
                            not appear that in the early stages of the claim Metzger &amp; Co.
                            predicated a right of recovery upon the ground of infraction of their
                            rights secured to them by the treaty between the Republic of Haiti and
                            the United States. At least as early as August 31, 1897, Mr. Powell, the
                            American minister at Port au Prince, in a communication to the secretary
                            of state of foreign affairs of Haiti, distinctly claimed that the
                            requirements of law were not applicable to all citizens alike as under
                            the treaty between the two countries they should be, and that they could
                            not be enforced. In the diplomatic presentation of the matter, in an
                            interview between the honorable minister of Haiti at Washington and the
                            solicitor of the State Department, the claim was made that the attempt
                            to collect taxes from Metzger &amp; Co.’s workmen was a violation of the
                            treaty rights secured to American citizens under the existing treaty.
                            This position does not seem to have been controverted by the
                            representative of Haiti, but he contended that the redress of Metzger
                            &amp; Co. for their alleged wrongs and grievances could be had in the
                            legal <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0354"/>tribunals of Haiti. The
                            American Government, in view of the disposition of the Haitian minister
                            and the pledge on the part of his Government to observe the rights of
                            American citizens under the treaty, on the 9th day of June sent an
                            instruction to its minister at Port au Prince as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Government agrees no longer to insist upon the settlement of
                                    said claims against the Haitian Government (referring to the
                                    license taxes) which, on its part, pledges itself to see that
                                    the rights which the treaty grants to American citizens in Haiti
                                    be strictly observed. This approval is, however, subordinate to
                                    Mr. Metzger’s right to demand indemnity for the illegal seizure
                                    and sale of his goods, and does not exclude the right of
                                    diplomatic intervention in case of a denial of justice.</p>

                        <p>On October 1, 1898, the Secretary of State of the United States, in an
                            extended note summarizing the position of his Government upon various
                            matters, among other things, said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>If the agreement then made for redress of Mr. Metzger’s grievance
                                    over the water supply had been promptly and faithfully
                                    performed, the Government might have had no occasion to
                                    intervene diplomatically in regard to the indemnity confessedly
                                    due Mr. Metzger for the illegal seizure and sale of his goods;
                                    for the Haitian Government has admitted the illegality of the
                                    license taxes, as being in violation of the treaty, and there
                                    can, therefore, be no question of the right of Mr. Metzger to
                                    such indemnity.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>On October 5 the minister of Haiti at Washington replied to this note,
                            and while he maintained the understanding that the remedy of Metzger
                            &amp; Co. should first be exhausted in the local tribunals of Haiti
                            before diplomatic intervention could be considered, he did not deny nor
                            in anywise controvert the statement above quoted from the note of
                            October 1 of the American Secretary of State. Thus the diplomatic
                            correspondence seems to establish the fact that the claim of Metzger
                            &amp; Co. presented conditions which brought it within the provisions of
                            the treaty in existence between the two nations. The stipulations of
                            this treaty, so far as relevant to the present case, in articles 5 and 6
                            thereof, provide: <list>
                                <item>Article 5. The citizens of each of the high contracting
                                    parties residing or established in the territory of the other
                                    shall be exempt from all compulsory military duty by sea or by
                                    land, and from all forced loans or military exactions or
                                    requisitions; nor shall they be compelled to pay any
                                    contributions whatsoever higher or other than those that are or
                                    may be paid by native citizens.</item>
                                <item>Article 6. The citizens of each of the contracting parties
                                    shall be permitted to enter, sojourn, settle, and reside in all
                                    parts of the territories of the other, engage in business, hire
                                    and occupy warehouses, provided they submit to the laws, as well
                                    general as special, relative to the rights of traveling,
                                    residing, or trading.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>It will be seen that by article 5 it is expressly provided that the
                            citizens of the high contracting parties residing or established in the
                            other’s territory shall not be compelled to pay any contribution
                            whatever higher or other than those which are or may be paid by native
                            citizens. By the sections of the law passed October 24, 1876, above
                            quoted, it is expressly provided that the license tax imposed upon
                            foreigners shall be double that imposed upon native workmen. This law
                            contains no exception in favor of American citizens residing in Haiti
                            whose rights are thus carefully conserved by the treaty between the two
                            countries. This law, so far as it affects American citizens, is in
                            direct violation of the stipulations of the treaty. In practice it is
                            shown that these license taxes were seldom enforced against workmen in
                            Haiti. By direct enactment of law the solemn obligations of the treaty
                            are ignored and discriminating burdens imposed upon foreigners <pb
                                n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0355"/>without exception. When this
                            condition of affairs was diplomatically called to the attention of the
                            authorities of the Republic of Haiti, it is to the credit of that
                            Government that it promptly conceded that American citizens had rights
                            under the treaty which deserve protection and which the Government of
                            Haiti undertook to see were duly guarded, leaving Metzger &amp; Co. to
                            pursue their remedy for the infraction of their rights already
                            sustained. Regarding this state of facts as established by the
                            diplomatic understanding of the two governments, we have a case in
                            which, notwithstanding the provisions of the treaty placing American
                            citizens upon the same plane in this regard as natives, a tax is levied
                            upon them of double the amount of that imposed upon natives, and when
                            not paid the employers of such workmen are subject to a summary seizure
                            and sale of their goods. It is strongly urged in the able argument
                            submitted by the minister of Haiti that the remedy of the claimants
                            should be sought in the local courts of Haiti, and that such remedy is
                            exclusive. Numerous precedents are cited to the proposition that
                            governments will not intervene diplomatically when such remedy is given.
                            As a general proposition, it is settled international law that a
                            government will not intervene in claims against foreign governments when
                            redress may be had in the courts of that country. If there has been a
                            substantial denial of justice, or a gross miscarriage thereof,
                            sanctioned and approved by the opposing government, a nation will then
                            intervene. The arbitrator in this case, however, is given jurisdiction
                            of the differences between the two governments by the terms of the
                            arbitral agreement, giving him jurisdiction and authority to determine
                            certain differences. It is expressly provided in the protocol: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>That the question of the liability of the Republic of Haiti to
                                    pay an indemnity in each of said cases, and if so found by the
                                    arbitrator, the further question of the amount of the said
                                    indemnity to be awarded shall be referred to the Hon. William R.
                                    Day, sometime Secretary of State of the United States, and now
                                    judge of the circuit court thereof, who is hereby appointed to
                                    hear said causes and to determine the questions of said
                                    liability and the amount of said indemnity, if any is found by
                                    said arbitrator to be justly due.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>From this agreement the authority of the arbitrator is derived. I can not
                            perceive that the competency of the arbitrator can be limited, because
                            of the fact that Metzger &amp; Co. might have sought judicial remedies
                            in the courts of Haiti. This fact may have weight in the determination
                            of the Government when its attention is called to claims against other
                            governments and may be sufficient reason for declining diplomatic
                            intervention until an attempt has been made to obtain judicial redress
                            in the courts of the country where the claimant is domiciled. The fact
                            that such remedy is afforded may be good ground for withholding consent
                            from an offer to arbitrate differences. I am at a loss to perceive how
                            it can afford a valid objection to the arbitrator exercising powers
                            conferred in the protocol of arbitration. The arbitrator is not called
                            upon to decide the question elaborately argued by the honorable
                            representative of Haiti, that under the constitution and laws of Haiti
                            the commune of Port au Prince is alone responsible for the unlawful
                            collection of the license taxes. The question submitted is, Is the
                            Republic of Haiti liable upon this claim; and if so, to what amount? I
                            do not deem it necessary to inquire as to whether the proceedings of the
                            officials were strictly in accordance with local laws. The law which
                            they were attempting to enforce was a law of the <pb n="276"
                                xml:id="pg_276" facs="0356"/>Republic of Haiti in violation of the
                            treaty between the two nations. It need hardly be stated that the
                            obligations of a treaty are as binding upon nations as are private
                            contracts upon individuals. This principle has been too often cited by
                            publicists and enforced by international decisions to need amplification
                            here. I find that the law authorizing double taxation upon foreigners,
                            so far as it relates to American citizens, was in violation of treaty
                            rights, and that the seizure and sale of Metzger &amp; Co.’s goods under
                            the facts established or conceded in this case was under a law sought to
                            be enforced in violation of treaty rights. About $1,200 worth of their
                            goods was seized and sold under the circumstances hereinbefore detailed.
                            I am of opinion that the Republic of Haiti, in compensation for the
                            goods and reparation for their seizure and sale in the manner herein
                            found, should pay to the claimants, John D. Metzger &amp; Co., the sum
                            of $5,000.</p>

                                831, Advance Sheets Consular Reports, September 12, 1900. The second
                                article of that treaty contains the following:</p>
                            <p>“The same reduction of the surtaxes of 50 per cent and 33⅓ percent
                                shall be accorded in that which concerns the tonnage dues paid by
                                French sailing vessels and on the merchandise debarked from French
                                steamers, on condition that the said merchandise be of French

                                treaty to the attention of the Haitian Government, together with
                                article 10 of the treaty of November 3, 1864, between the United
                                States and Haiti, by which it is provided that no higher or other
                                duties upon tonnage or cargo of vessels of the United States shall

                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Chargé d’Affaires</hi>: By your dispatch of
                                the 27th of the month of September last you request me to inform you
                                whether, in consequence of the new commercial agreement made between
                                Haiti and France, the Government of the Republic has the intention
                                of imposing on American vessels transporting to our ports
                                merchandise of French origin higher tonnage dues than those paid by
                                French vessels loaded with merchandise from the same province.</p>
                            <p>In reply to this communication I have the honor to announce to you
                                that the minister plenipotentiary of Haiti at Washington will soon
                                be charged to discuss the matter with the Department of State.</p>
                            <p>You kindly, in concluding, called my attention to Article X of the
                                treaty of November 3, 1864, which provides that there shall not be
                                collected on the tonnage or the cargo of vessels of the United
                                States higher or other dues than those imposed on vessels of the
                                most favored nation.</p>
                            <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0358"/>
                            <p>In the first place, I would beg you to observe that the clearly
                                determined reciprocity character of the new Haitian-French agreement
                                withdraws it from the influence of the “most-favored-nation clause.”
                                Then, to the provisions of Article X of the treaty of 1864, that you
                                invoke, I would ask of you permission to oppose the very precise
                                stipulations of Article II of the same diplomatic document, reading
                                thus: “The Republic of Haiti and the United States of America
                                desiring, etc., * * * have agreed that any favor, exemption,
                                privilege, and immunity whatever, in matters of commerce or of
                                navigation, which either of them has granted or may hereafter grant,
                                to the citizens or subjects of any other government, nation, or
                                state, shall extend, in identity of cases and circumstances, to the
                                citizens of the other contracting party; gratuitously, if the
                                concession in favor of that other government, nation, or state shall
                                have been gratuitous, or in return for an equivalent compensation,
                                if the concession shall have been conditional.”</p>
                            <p>Now, you are certainly not ignorant that if certain tariff
                                concessions have been agreed in favor of French merchandise it was
                                on the express condition that our principal products would profit of
                                the lowest duties on their entrance in French ports.</p>
                            <p>Besides, do you think, Mr. Chargé d’Affaires, that notwithstanding
                                all its kindly dispositions toward the Republic of Haiti, the
                                Federal Government could agree to waive the restrictive clause set
                                forth in the second paragraph of Article II and ever agree, without
                                compensation, not to levy “on the importation into the United States
                                of any article the growth, production, or manufacture of Haiti or
                                her fisheries; and no higher or other duties shall be imposed on the
                                importation into Haiti of any article the growth, produce, or
                                manufacture of the United States or her fisheries than are or shall
                                be payable on the like articles the growth, produce, or manufacture
                                of any other foreign country or its fisheries,” with which the
                                United States would be bound by a reciprocity treaty. (Article XIII
                                of the treaty of 1864.)</p>
                            <p>I think it superfluous, in giving these considerations to the
                                equitable appreciation of your legation, to insist on the provisions
                                so clearly explicative, and take the occasion to renew to you, Mr.
                                Chargé d’Affaires, the assurances of my very distinguished

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your No. 822, of October 10,
                            last, relative to the alleged right of the Haitian Government to impose
                            higher duties on United States vessels carrying French goods than on
                            French vessels, I have to say that you may advise the Government of
                            Haiti that this Government is of opinion that Article X of the
                            convention of 1864 between the United States and Haiti is quite
                            independent of Article XI and creates absolute rights, which this
                            Government can not fail to insist upon. Should, therefore, any higher
                            charges be collected on American tonnage than that of any other country
                            they will be reclaimed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: A gentleman by the name of Julienne
                            Guilloid called and requested to be registered on the books of the
                            legation as an American citizen. He not being able to furnish sufficient
                            evidence that such was the case, I have refused, but stated to him that
                            I would call the attention of the honorable Secretary of State to his
                            request.</p>
                        <p>The evidence that he produced to support his request for registration is
                            a paper issued to his father forty-one years ago by the State of
                            Louisiana, bearing the name of Julienne, a mulatto, and stating that
                            “the bearer was a resident of that State.” Attached thereto was the seal
                            of the State and the signature of the governor, John Whitcliff. In
                            addition to this another paper was produced, bearing the signature of
                            one of the United States consular agents, calling upon this Government
                            to give the bearer protection and the right to move from place to place
                            in the Republic of Haiti as an American citizen. Later there appears an
                            indorsement upon this paper of a similar character, signed by the Hon.
                            J. W. Thompson, at the time the United States minister resident and
                            consul-general here.</p>
                        <p>I would be glad to send copies of such papers, but Mr. Guilloid refused
                            to leave them without his father’s consent. After a further
                            investigation I find that this gentleman has no intention of returning
                            to the United States, nor has he returned within the time he left,
                            forty-one years ago, during the whole of which time he has been a
                            resident of St. Marc, Haiti (I have reference to the father). The son,
                            who is <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0360"/>the applicant for
                            registration, is 23 years of age, has never been to the States at any
                            period of his life, nor was he registered on the books of the legation
                            or the consulate at the time of his birth. As I have stated, I have
                            refused to register him, believing that his father had lost his
                            citizenship, and that the son had not made this request at the time he
                            reached his majority. I do not desire to do injustice to him, and
                            therefore request of the Department to inform me if the action taken by
                            me was correct.</p>

                            applied to you for registration as an American citizen. He was born in

                            considers that your action is correct in declining to register him as a

                        <p>The information given below is believed to be correct, yet it is not to
                            be considered as official, as it relates to the laws and regulations of
                            a foreign country.</p>
                        <p>Italian subjects between the ages of 20 and 39 years are liable for the
                            performance of military duty under Italian law, except in the case of an
                            only son, or where two brothers are so nearly of the same age that both
                            would be serving at the same time, in which event only one is drafted,
                            or when there are two sons of a widow, when only one is taken.</p>
                        <p>Naturalization of an Italian subject in a foreign country without consent
                            of the Italian Government is no bar to liability to military
                            service.</p>
                        <p>A former Italian subject may visit Italy without fear of molestation when
                            he is under the age of 20 years; but between the ages of 20 and 39 he is
                            liable to arrest and forced military service, if he has not previously
                            reported for such service. After the age of 39 he may be arrested and
                            imprisoned (but will not be compelled to do military duty) unless he has
                            been pardoned. He may petition the Italian Government for pardon, but
                            this Department will not act as the intermediary in presenting his
                            petition.</p>
                        <p>There is no treaty between the United States and Italy defining the
                            status of former Italian subjects who have become American citizens.</p>
                        <p>The Italian law does not require the production of passports by foreign
                            travelers, but they are frequently called upon to establish their
                            identity, and are accordingly recommended to provide themselves with
                            passports. They are often useful in preventing an interference with
                            departure from Italy. They do not require to be viséed or indorsed.</p>

                            tell you a short time ago, two Italians were attacked on the 11th (?)
                            instant and killed by an armed mob, while a third was wounded, under
                            circumstances which constituted a lynching. The names of the victims
                            were Giovanni and Vincenzo Serio, and that of the wounded man is
                            Salvatore Liberto, all of them being natives of Cefalu, Sicily. The
                            crime was committed at Erwin, Miss.</p>
                        <p>The serious nature of this case will not escape the attention of the
                            United States Government, and, deeply deploring what has occurred, I beg
                            your excellency to be pleased to instruct the proper authorities to the
                            end that an official investigation of this matter may be held at once,
                            if possible, and that the guilty parties may be arrested and punished
                            according to law.</p>
                        <p>I have, at the same time, the honor to make a warm appeal to the good

                            in the county where the crime was committed with a view to securing to

                            in force between Italy and the United States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Acting Secretary of State</hi>: A copy of the
                            record of the inquest conducted by W. E. Hunt, sheriff of Greenville,
                            Miss., and embodying the verdict of the jury in the matter of the
                            lynching at Erwin, has just reached me from the royal consulate at New
                            Orleans.</p>
                        <p>I deem it expedient to communicate to your excellency a copy of that
                            strange document which for the sentiments therein expressed and the
                            manner in which it is worded, deserves, in my opinion, the attention of
                            the Federal Government.</p>
                        <p>It is scarcely necessary for me to point out the deplorable effects on
                            the people of Washington County, Miss., and the painful impression in
                            all parts that may be wrought by principles such as those that are
                            recognized by a judicial officer and a commission composed of “six good
                            and lawful men” as put in the report of inquest under consideration.</p>
                        <p>At the present time—that is to say, twelve days after the lynching—I am
                            without advice that its perpetrators have been arrested, and since it is
                            established by experience in the preceding cases of the same nature that
                            the guilty never were punished, I permit myself to ask your excellency
                            whether it may not be feasible for the Federal Government to send
                            “detectives” to the spot on its own account for the detection of the
                            lynchers. Such a step might facilitate the attainment of the object in
                            view; it would also evidence the interest the Government of the United
                            States takes in the triumph of the cause of justice and humanity. That
                            such is the most earnest desire of the Federal Government has been over
                            and again declared by your excellency and his excellency, Mr. Hay.</p>
                        <p>This absolute necessity of insuring a regular operation of the laws and
                            the punishment of the guilty is also a matter of supreme interest to the
                            Government of the King, my August Sovereign—as I have had many occasions
                            to state it.</p>
                        <p>A telegram, received by me last night, from the minister for foreign
                            affairs again repeats this sentiment and brings me evidence of the
                            Sensation of grief produced by this fifth lynching.</p>
                        <p>Awaiting the communication that your excellency may be pleased to make in
                            the matter, I renew, etc.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt on Sunday, July 21, of the following telegram<note n="a"
                                xml:id="d264fna">Printed ante.</note> (of July 20).</p>
                        <p>Pursuant to this instruction, I sought an interview with the minister of
                            foreign affairs which was fixed for, this morning, and in the
                            conversation which has just ended I expressed to M. Prinetti the
                            assurances of the Government at Washington as declared in your telegram.
                            I also left with him a memorandum on the subject reading as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The governor of Mississippi is investigating the alleged lynching
                                    at Erwin, Miss., of persons born in Italy. The United States
                                    Government will take all legal steps which the facts may warrant
                                    to secure justice against the guilty persons.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The minister did not express any opinion in regard to the information and
                            assurance which I gave to him. He even omitted to thank me for the
                            communication, but the omission was, of course, unintentional. He did
                            express, however, an earnest hope that in this the fifth case <pb
                                n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0367"/>of lynching (as he said) of
                            Italian subjects in the United States within a few years the guilty
                            persons might be punished, especially since they were known. It seemed
                            singular to him that Congress had not acted upon the President’s recent
                            suggestions to pass some law which would authorize the Federal
                            Government to intervene in some way in the proceedings of justice in the
                            individual States of the Union when occasion requires; but he feared
                            that Congress would do nothing. I agreed with him in hoping that the
                            President’s suggestions might be acted upon, and explained to him, as
                            has been explained to previous ministers, the difficulty, often on
                            account of local feeling, which exists in certain parts of the United
                            States, as well as in Italy (in Sicily, for instance), of always
                            obtaining exact justice in cases of certain crimes. M. Prinetti
                            contented himself in reply by reaffirming his hope that this last “of a
                            series of lynchings” would be adequately punished.</p>
                        <p>I may add that we are entirely in ignorance in the embassy of the details
                            of this incident at Erwin. The Italian papers give no particulars,
                            simply saying that another case of lynching has occurred, and as yet the
                            American newspapers which might inform us have not come.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Acting Secretary of State</hi>: With a view to
                            facilitating the search for the authors of the lynching at Erwin, Miss.,
                            I deem it my duty to communicate to your excellency some important data
                            collected by the New Orleans consulate upon the spot, by means of
                            persons in whom it has confidence.</p>
                        <p>Vincenzo Serio, one of the victims, eight months ago had a dispute in
                            regard to a horse of his that was found on the property of an American
                            citizen. The latter, and other citizens of Glen Allen, armed with guns,
                            attempted to murder Serio, whom they left wounded, but who succeeded in
                            escaping to Greenville. Lately, having returned for the purpose of
                            rejoining his father, Giovanni Serio (the other victim), at Glen Allen,
                            the citizens ordered him to leave the village within thirty days. He
                            paid no attention to this order, and during the night of the 10th to the
                            11th instant the citizens went to the house with the intention of
                            killing him and anyone whom they might find sleeping there.</p>
                        <p>At Glen Allen no secret was made of the preparations for the lynching.
                            Vincenzo Giglio and Giuseppe Butera, two Italians who got wind of it,
                            attempted three times to telephone to Serio a warning of the danger with
                            which he was threatened, but on each of the three occasions they were
                            denied the use of the telephone. At Erwin, Glenville, and Glen Allen
                            everyone is afraid to speak, but knows that the citizens of Glen Allen
                            are the organizers and authors of the lynching.</p>
                        <p>The importance of these particulars, which have been forwarded to <pb
                                n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0368"/>us by our consulate at New
                            Orleans, can not escape the attention of your excellency. By their means
                            the Mississippi authorities, if, as may be expected of a civilized
                            country, they have really the cause of justice at heart, will be able
                            beyond doubt to trace the authors of the brutal crime.</p>
                        <p>Be pleased to accept, Mr. Acting Secretary, the assurances of my highest
                            consideration.</p>

                            <p>On the second day after the unfortunate occurrence I went in person
                                to Washington County, where I learned from the sheriff that promptly
                                on receipt of said telegram he visited Erwin, the scene of the
                                homicide, where he made every endeavor to find out the names of the
                                guilty parties and to obtain such facts as would justify their
                                arrest, but that he was unable to obtain any reliable proof to
                                establish the identity of those concerned in the murder.</p>
                            <p>It appears that the deed was done under the cover of darkness by
                                unknown men, who quickly and quietly disappeared, leaving no trace
                                of their identity which the sheriff could obtain. I beg to say
                                further that immediately after the said interview with the sheriff I
                                had a conversation with the judge of the criminal court of the
                                district, who expressed his purpose to exercise the full power of
                                his court under the law, so far as possible, for the apprehension
                                and punishment of all concerned in the crime. I feel warranted in
                                the assertion that both the judge and the court officials will do

                                the law and to have full justice administered in the premises. My
                                private advice is that none of the Italians named were naturalized
                                American citizens, but of this I am not sure and will make <pb

                                and report later. I am pleased to say also that the citizens of
                                Washington County, where the murders occurred, deplore and condemn
                                in unmeasured zeal the action of the guilty parties, as will appear

                                        as being subversive of the principles of good government, a

                                        will condone, acquiesce in, or tolerate such crime, a wanton
                                        insult and stigma to a county noted for its law-abiding and
                                        honorable citizenship; and deeply impressed with the

                                        murder may be discovered and brought to justice; and that
                                        the governor be requested to offer a suitable reward for the

                                thereupon, interrogated severally and jointly, have declared:</p>
                            <p>That they were well acquainted with Giovanni Serio, son of the late
                                -----, native of Cefalu, Palermo, by trade a peddler, about 55 years

                                midnight, at Erwin, Miss., and that to their certain knowledge the
                                said Giovanni Serio (illiterate and impecunious) has never assumed
                                American citizenship.</p>

                                49 years of age, now residing at Greenville, Miss., who having been

                                peddler, 19 years of age, residing at Erwin, Miss., illiterate and
                                impecunious, who is present at the writing of this instrument and
                                lying in bed by reason of serious injuries received during the night

                                were lynched, and that to their certain knowledge the said Salvatore
                                Liberto has never assumed American citizenship, the law itself not
                                permitting it owing to his being under age.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of the 22d instant in further reference to the
                            murder of Italians at Erwin, Miss.</p>
                        <p>You communicate a copy of the record of the inquest embodying the finding
                            of the jury in this regrettable affair, and state that on account of the
                            strange wording of the document you deem it expedient to bring it to the
                            attention of the Department.</p>
                        <p>While the finding of the coroner’s jury is perhaps, as you state,
                            somewhat unusual in phraseology, it is in effect the finding customary
                            in such cases when the evidence at the inquest does not disclose to the
                            jury the authors of the homicide. The effect of the finding is to
                            devolve upon the judicial authorities of the State further investigation
                                <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0373"/>of the case with a view to
                            discovering and punishing the perpetrators of the crime. It leaves the
                            way open for the usual course of justice in endeavoring to ascertain the
                            “parties unknown.”</p>
                        <p>Not being advised up to the time of writing that the perpetrators of the
                            crime had been arrested, you inquire whether it might not facilitate the
                            cause of justice if the Federal Government should send a “detective” to
                            the spot for the “detection of the lynchers.”</p>
                        <p>A suggestion to substantially the same effect was made by Baron Fava
                            pending the consideration of the Tallulah incident in 1899. Baron Fava,
                            in a telegram dated September 21 of that year, expressed the hope that
                            the special agent appointed by the Department would “discover and
                            denounce the criminals.” I replied, on the same date, that “in the
                            actual status of the matter and in the absence of Federal jurisdiction

                            merely to collect information for the Department’s consideration and
                            such action as might be in order.</p>

                            to acknowledge the reception of and to express my thanks for the copy of
                            the investigation made by the governor of Mississippi concerning the
                            lynching at Erwin and courteously communicated to me with note No. 691
                            of the 25th instant.</p>
                        <p>As I had occasion to tell you yesterday and now permit myself again to
                            observe, the statements made in the investigation do not afford evidence
                            that the Mississippi authorities have brought into play all the means at
                            their disposal for detecting the perpetrators of that cruel crime.</p>
                        <p>It grieves me to note that thus far, many days after the crime, it does
                            not appear that there has been made, nor even instituted, a judicial
                            inquiry, the first step to be taken immediately upon the commission of
                            an offense of any character. Nothing in that direction has been been
                            done by the State’s attorney or any other authority, with the exception
                            of the first jury convened by the local sheriff and the result of which
                            was so much unlooked for that I deemed it my duty to send you a copy of
                            the document in my note of the 22d instant.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the embassy has been able to conduct an investigation
                            of its own, and in compliance with the wish you expressed yesterday, <pb

                                to the effect that they were denied, three times at least, the use
                                of the telephone on the day preceding the lynching, when they wanted
                                to tell Vincenzo Serio (one of the victims) about the organized
                                conspiracy and the peril he was in, according to the advice they had
                                from one Liberto, a brother of the wounded man, who had it himself
                                from one Dr. Hanna or Hollow, is fully corroborated. The latter is
                                said to have warned young Liberto not to go to Erwin that night,
                                because the Italians were to be killed.</item>

                                about the horse (see my note of the 24th instant) appears to be Mr.
                                G. B. Allen, residing at Glen Allen, manager of a large
                                “plantation.” This man, according to many who have been interrogated
                                on the spot, must, beyond a doubt, have been the organizer and
                                instigator of the crime. Save that horse incident, there is no other
                                known cause for which the lynching could have been brought
                                about.</item>

                            <item>On the evening before the crime, it is asserted there was noticed
                                an unusual stir in Erwin and some Italians who inquired what was the
                                reason, were told that a church meeting was to be held.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>These advices afford a sufficient basis for an earnest and efficient
                            investigation. Since it was possible for the embassy and the consular
                            officers of New Orleans and Vicksburg to secure them with the limited
                            means at their disposal, it will have to be admitted that the
                            Mississippi authorities have not thus far done to detect the guilty that
                            which is demanded by the principles of humanity and justice which the
                            Governments of Italy and of the United States have equally at heart.</p>
                        <p>The honest agitation created in the country by the fell deed, and which
                            is confirmed even by the governor’s investigation, ought to stimulate
                            the authorities to energetic action, if only as satisfaction to public
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>Besides examining the persons hereinbefore named and the employee at the
                            railroad station of Erwin, which is quite close to the scene of the
                            crime, it seems that there might be at hand sufficient presumption of
                            Mr. G. B. Allen’s guilt, for whose arrest it is to be regretted that a
                            warrant should not have been already issued. The point of capital
                            interest is also that the witnesses be put in a position to give their
                            testimony freely and that provisions be made for their safety. It is to
                            be inferred from the difficulties met by our agents in their
                            investigation that strong intimidation is brought to bear on the spot;
                            the wounded man himself has declared that he knew little or nothing.</p>

                        <p>Later in the day, by appointment, I took with me to the foreign office
                            the contents of your instruction in the form of a note. The minister was
                            absent, having been called to the King; but I saw the secretary-general,
                            M. Malvano. He received the communication, read it, and then, remarking
                            that what he said, of course, was not official, expressed disappointment
                            that the State Department would not pursue private detective
                            investigations itself, so that if the Mississippi authorities did not do
                            their full duty, the Federal Government would be prepared to urge them
                            to do so with effect. He thought that hesitation to take such a course
                            was open to suspicion of lack of interest. I referred him again to the
                            correspondence with Baron Fava, as explaining the attitude and powers of
                            the State Department, reassuring him of the desire of the Federal
                            Government to see that complete justice was done to the guilty persons.
                            I am sending you to-day a cable<note n="a" xml:id="d272fnc">Not
                                printed.</note> which expresses M. Malvano’s views, because, while
                            he does not speak with authority, his opinions probably are
                            representative of the real feeling in the foreign office. They are
                            undoubtedly very sore, there, declaring that it is extraordinary that
                            for five cases of lynching no one suffers.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Later.</hi>—I have this morning seen the minister
                            for foreign affairs, who thanked me for the assurances of the note of
                            yesterday. While hoping that justice would be done, he said he might
                            confess that he doubted the expressed intentions of the authorities of
                            the State of Mississippi, in view of past experiences. And he read a
                            dispatch from the Italian chargé d’affaires at Washington, saying that,
                            according to his best information, the investigations of the local and
                            State authorities in this matter were feeble. I explained that police
                            investigations were not made manifest until something had been
                            accomplished, and again called his attention to the assurances in your
                            cabled instruction, that the governor of Mississippi was resolved to
                            execute justice if possible, and that the sentiment of the local
                            community sustained him in his purpose.</p>

                            expedient, for the purpose of facilitating the measures taken to find
                            the principals of the lynching at Erwin, Miss., to sum up, in my notes
                            of July 24 and 30, the result of the investigations conducted on the
                            spot by the direction of the royal consulate at New Orleans. Dr. Hill
                            assured me that these notes had been promptly communicated to the
                            governor of Mississippi. These notes, by reason of the important data
                            they contain, place the local authorities in a position to detect the
                            murderers.</p>
                        <p>Being still without a reply, I beg your most illustrious lordship to be
                            good enough courteously to call upon the governor for information
                            concerning the outcome of the action taken by him.</p>
                        <p>As you will understand, every delay in the execution of such action makes
                            it more difficult to attain the end desired by the Government of the
                            King and that of the United States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: Inasmuch as the grand jury of the
                            circuit court of the district of Mississippi, called in the case on the
                            9th of last month, has also adjourned after five sittings, with a
                            statement that, owing to the manifest reticence of intimidated or
                            suborned witnesses, it had been unable to gather sufficient evidence
                            against the guilty in the Erwin outrage, the Government of the King has
                            been once more constrained to adhere to its conviction that the State
                            judiciary of the Union is not in a position to insure for aliens, at all
                            times and under all circumstances, the protection to which they are
                            entitled by treaty. In view of the fact that in this instance previous
                            investigations had, even before judicial proceedings had been developed,
                            already secured not a few data concerning those who could be presumed to
                            be principals or accessories in the crime, and that it was in every way
                            ascertained that two persons at least—Dr. Hanna and the telephone
                            operator of Glen Allen—had previous knowledge of the misdeed, it is
                            obvious that if the grand jury did not overcome the conspiracy of
                            silence or reach a final conclusion, it, too, did not know how to free
                            itself from baneful surrounding influences and resolutely do its
                            duty.</p>
                        <p>In this condition of things the Government of the King has sent me
                            express instructions to enter the most energetic protest against what
                            is, all at once, a denial of justice, a flagrant violation of
                            contractual conventions, and a grave offense to every human and civil
                            sentiment.</p>
                        <p>The Federal Government itself admitted after the preceding lynching that
                            in this respect the judiciary organization of the country is deficient,
                            and that the defect calls for a prompt remedy, since it is thereby
                            placed in the irksome position of being unable to keep faith with the
                            treaties that bear its signature. The illustrious President recently
                            carried off by a tragic death had earnestly recommended in one of his
                            messages that provisions be made therefor, but the bills introduced in
                            both Houses of Congress at the suggestion of the President did not come
                            to the test of a vote.</p>
                        <p>Until the desired reform shall have become an accomplished fact the
                            Government of the King not only will have grounds of complaint for <pb
                                n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0378"/>violation of the treaties to
                            its injury, but will not cease to denounce the systematic impunity
                            enjoyed by crime, and to hold the Federal Government responsible
                            therefor.</p>
                        <p>Italy has always cherished the warmest friendship for the United States,
                            and felt the most profound liking, and admiration for the institutions
                            of the Union, but the Italian Government can not conceal that its long
                            standing and constant sentiments are subjected to a very severe ordeal
                            when it sees its own people fall repeatedly and with impunity victims to
                            such barbarous assaults.</p>

                                In regard to an indemnity, he declared that it would be more
                                decorous for Italy to refuse absolutely to accept it; remarked,
                                also, that for the four preceding lynchings the Federal Government
                                had never given proper satisfaction to Italy by arresting and
                                punishing the guilty persons. He concluded by inquiring what the
                                intentions of the ministry were as to the solution of this most
                                important matter.</p>
                            <p>M. Prinetti (minister for foreign affairs) in reply said that he had
                                supposed he had previously explained the attitude of the Government
                                toward the lynching at Erwin, and declared that absolutely nothing
                                had been done to keep the fact of the crime secret. The Government,
                                he continued, had instructed its diplomatic agents to use all its
                                efforts to identify and bring to justice the criminals, but he added
                                (comments from the senators) that all these efforts had been in
                                vain. He described the course taken, saying that the Italian
                                Government had, in a note to the Federal Government, rehearsed the
                                details of the facts of the case and insisted upon the necessity of
                                providing a remedy. The Federal Government had received the note
                                with promises for the future to use all possible efforts to prevent
                                the repetition of similar occurrences. He was not of the opinion of
                                the Senator (Fava) about refusing the indemnity offered by the
                                Federal Government to the families of the murdered men; the
                                Government of the King would not demand an indemnity, because it
                                could not admit that money could compensate for the shedding of the
                                blood of Italian citizens, yet the Government would accept an
                                indemnity for the families of the victims, if spontaneously offered.
                                M. Prinetti concluded by saying that while Italy should maintain a
                                proper attitude toward its colonists abroad, she should not appear
                                too vigorous on their behalf, because it was a fact that in those
                                far regions the Italians were received with a great measure of
                                benevolent hospitality. (Cries of “good” and other indications of
                                approval.)</p>
                            <p>Baron Fava accepted the declaration of the minister and thanked
                                him.</p>

                            receipt of your instruction No. 32, of July 31 last, directing me to
                            obtain information in regard to the relations between Italy and the
                            Sultan, Osman Mahmud.</p>
                        <p>Italy, since 1889, has included Somaliland within her sphere of influence
                            in Africa, and the Sultan apparently accepted her sovereignty, but some
                            months ago he rebelled, influenced, perhaps, by the Mad Mullah, who is
                            making trouble within the neighboring English sphere. But soon after the
                                <hi rend="italic">Indra</hi> was wrecked, and before the <hi
                                rend="italic">Asturia</hi> went ashore near Cape Guardafin, Italy,
                            backed by two gunboats, had persuaded Osman so effectively that, when
                            the <hi rend="italic">Asturía</hi> foundered, the <pb n="300"
                                xml:id="pg_300" facs="0380"/>Sultan had so far returned to his
                            allegiance that his aid was used, it is alleged, in protecting the
                            stranded ship and cargo.</p>
                        <p>Within two or three days the Italian Government has received from S.
                            Pestalozza, its consul-general at Zanzibar, who has charge of this
                            region, dispatches indicating that Osman Mahmud has quieted down to
                            loyalty, and fully recognizes Italian sovereignty. He has signed an
                            agreement which binds him to protect, by all means in his power, wrecked
                            ships and their cargoes; to prevent trade in firearms and intoxicating
                            liquors; to consent to the erection of light-houses on his coast, and to
                            fly the Italian flag over all his people’s vessels—the sambucii—sailing
                            boats of 300 or 400 tons. For this work and submission Italy will allow
                            him about $5,000 a year in monthly payments.</p>

                                        or for others, unless the permission of the Royal Government

                                        inhabitant of Mijurtina, the sultan shall be responsible
                                        therefor, and it shall be his duty to deliver such guns or

                                        100 rupees for each gun and 300 rupees for each box of

                                        be chargeable to the sultan. The Royal Government hereby
                                        grants to the sultan the privilege of retaining such guns as
                                        he now has; the said arms shall be numbered and registered
                                        as belonging to the sultan. When the Government shall desire
                                        it, such guns may be exchanged for guns of Italian
                                        manufacture. The prohibition to import firearms in all
                                        Mijurtina shall be announced by the sultan in writing or in
                                        such other way as may be deemed most suitable.</item>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I inclose herewith copy of a dispatch from
                            the consul-general of the United States at Rome requesting instructions
                            in regard to issuing passports to minors residing in Italy and born in
                            the United States of alien parents, the particular case in point being
                            that of a minor, Francesco Guarino, to whom a passport was issued by you
                            against the consul-general’s representations.</p>
                        <p>The question raised by the consul-general is, in his own words, as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Can a minor residing temporarily or permanently abroad, but born
                                    in the United States of alien parents who have never been
                                    naturalized nor intimated their intentions of becoming
                                    naturalized, be considered an American citizen? And is such
                                    minor entitled to an American passport?</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The position of the Department is that birth in the United States,
                            irrespective of the nationality of the parents, confers American
                            citizenship; that no act of the parent can deprive the child of the
                            status thus acquired, and that consequently such children, even though
                            taken abroad by their parents, are entitled to be treated as citizens of
                            the United States. In view of the decisions of our Federal courts, there
                            can be no doubt of the correctness of this position. It has been almost
                            uniformly held by our Federal courts that birth within the dominions and
                            jurisdiction of the United States confers citizenship irrespective of
                            the nationality of the parents. The question was squarely presented to
                            the Supreme Court in 1897 in the case of Wong Kim Ark, who was born in
                            the United States of parents who were subjects of the Emperor of China.
                            In 1890, when he was 17 years of age, he went to China for a visit,
                            returning to the United States the same year. He was permitted to enter
                            the United States, and remained here until 1894, when he again went to
                            China for a visit. He returned to the United States in 1895, but the
                            collector of customs at San Francisco denied his application for
                            admission on the ground that he was not a citizen of the United States.
                            Upon habeas corpus the United States district court ordered him to be
                            discharged on the ground that he was a citizen of <pb n="304"
                                xml:id="pg_304" facs="0384"/>the United States. The United States
                            appealed to the United States Supreme Court, and that court (169 U. S.,
                            649) affirmed the judgment of the lower court, thus authoritatively
                            settling the question.</p>
                        <p>The question whether the father by removing the child from the
                            jurisdiction of the United States or otherwise can deprive him of the
                            citizenship conferred upon him by birth has also been passed upon by the
                            Federal courts. In ex parte Chun King (35 Fed. Rep., 354) Judge Deady,
                            in delivering the opinion of the United States circuit court, said:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>In my judgment, the father can not deprive his minor child of the
                                    status of American citizenship impressed upon it by the
                                    circumstances of its birth under the Constitution and within the
                                    jurisdiction of the United States. This status once acquired can
                                    only be lost or changed by the act of the person when arrived al
                                    majority and the consent of the Government.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report the
                                following: A minor, named Francesco Guarino, born in the United
                                States of Italian parents, not naturalized, applied to our embassy
                                in Rome, through our consul at Palermo, where he is now residing,
                                for a passport. The application was granted by the chargé
                                d’affaires, Mr. Iddings, against my representations, under the plea
                                that the boy was born in the United States and was to be considered
                                a United States citizen, although a minor and his parents being at
                                the time of his birth and still are Italian subjects.</p>
                            <p>As the question may arise again, I deem it my duty, with the
                                agreement of Mr. Iddings, to respectfully request the Department for
                                a strong legal opinion upon the subject, in order to settle the
                                controversy and to guide our action in the future.</p>
                            <p>The point is this: Can a minor residing temporarily or permanently
                                abroad, but born in the United States of alien parents who have
                                never been naturalized nor intimated their intentions of becoming
                                naturalized, be considered an American citizen? And is such minor
                                entitled to an American passport?</p>
                            <p>No. 864, section 992 of title 25 of the Statutes of the United States
                                relating to citizenship reads as follows: “All persons born in the
                                United States and not subject to any foreign power, excluding
                                Indians not taxed, are declared to be citizens of the United
                                States.” It would therefore appear clear to me that a child born in
                                the United States of alien parents can not be considered to be a
                                United States citizen, especially when said child is outside of the
                                United States, no more than a child born abroad of American parents
                                could be considered a citizen of the country where he happened to be
                                born.</p>
                            <p>Then again, Prof. Alexander Porter Morse, in No. 7 of the Treaties of
                                Citizenship, published in Washington, considers “the country of the
                                father is that of the children, at least during their minority.”</p>
                            <p>This point involves the right of a United States legation or embassy
                                abroad to make aliens American citizens, that right lying, I
                                believe, solely within the power of the United States courts.</p>
                            <p>All of which is respectfully submitted.</p>

                            against the Auric Mining Company, of Hinsdale County, Colo., by Mrs.
                            Fenice Ferrara, for indemnity by reason of the death of her husband, an
                            employee of the said company, caused by a disaster in the mines, the
                            district court of Pueblo, Colo., is said to have decided that the
                            plaintiff had no right to sue in justice, owing to her quality of
                            resident and subject of the Kingdom of Italy.</p>
                        <p>This decision seems to be in contradiction of the treaty of February 26,
                            1871, between Italy and the United States, and I have the honor to
                            submit to the high judgment of your excellency a copy (which, I pray, be
                            eventually returned) of the proceedings and of the decision in said
                            case, accompanied by a letter of Mr. M. J. Galligan, counsel of Mrs.
                            Ferrara, for such measures as the Federal Government, custodian of and
                            responsible for the international compacts, will see fit to take.</p>

                                therein stated are true, as he verily believes; that he makes this

                                the said plaintiff is not a resident of Hinsdale County, Colo., and

                                amended complaint says:</p>
                            <p>Defendant is informed and believes, and so alleges, that the
                                plaintiff is, and at all times heretofore has been, a resident
                                citizen and subject of the Kingdom of Italy, and that the plaintiff
                                is not now, and never has been at any time, a resident or citizen of
                                the State of. Colorado or of the United States of America, and is
                                not entitled to bring or prosecute this action in any courts of the
                                State of Colorado.</p>
                            <p>Wherefore the defendant prays that it may be hence dismissed, and
                                that it recover its costs laid out and expended in this behalf.</p>

                            <p>Said court granted the said motion and allowed the said amendment to
                                be filed over the objection of the said plaintiff, and dismissed the
                                said jury and abandoned the then trial of the said cause before the

                                contain facts sufficient to constitute a defense to plaintiff’s
                                complaint of cause of action.</p>

                            <p>That afterwards the said defendant moved to strike the said demurrer
                                from the files, which said motion was sustained by the court over
                                the objection of the said plaintiff, and the said plaintiff then and
                                there moved to have the said action set down for hearing and trial,
                                and the said court overruled the said motion, to which ruling due
                                exception was taken by the said plaintiff.</p>
                            <p>That thereupon the said defendant, by its attorney, moved for
                                judgment upon the pleadings, for the reason that no reply had been
                                filed to the said amendment to the defendant’s answer, the said
                                motion being oral and without any previous notice to plaintiff or
                                her attorney. And the court sustained said motion and rendered
                                judgment in favor of the said defendant for costs of suit, when the
                                record in this case shows that the plaintiff was allowed to
                                prosecute without the payment of costs as a poor person, and
                                dismissed the said action at the costs of said plaintiff as
                                aforesaid.</p>
                            <p>That the said judgment dismissing the said action and denying the
                                said plaintiff the right to prosecute this action, for the alleged
                                reason that the said plaintiff is and has been a resident and
                                subject of the Kingdom of Italy, and that the plaintiff is now and
                                never has been at any time a resident or citizen of the State of
                                Colorado, of the United States of America, and is not entitled to
                                bring or prosecute this action in any of the courts of the State of
                                Colorado, as alleged in the said amendment to defendant’s answer, is
                                in violation of the treaty of 1871 between the Federal Government of
                                the United States of America and the Kingdom of Italy, which said

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of the 16th instant presenting for the
                            consideration of this Government the complaint of the Italian subject,
                            Mrs. Fenice Ferrara, that she has been denied justice in the district
                            court of Pueblo, Colo.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I have the honor to say that it appears from the transcript of
                            the record of judicial proceedings transmitted by you that Pietro
                            Ferrara, an Italian subject, an employee of the Auric Mining Company, a
                            corporation of the State of Colorado, while working in a mine belonging
                            to said company near Henson, Colo., on June 26, 1897, was injured by the
                            falling of a large rock from the roof of the mine, and died shortly
                            thereafter. The widow of the deceased brought an action against the
                            mining company in the district court of the county of Hinsdale, to
                            recover damages for the death of her husband, on the ground that the
                            same was due to the negligence of the company. She claimed damages in
                            the sum of $5,000. By agreement of the parties a change of venue was had
                            to the district court of the county of Pueblo. In the course of the
                            proceedings a motion was made by the defendant that the case be
                            dismissed on the ground that the plaintiff was a nonresident alien and
                            not entitled to prosecute the action in any of the courts of Colorado.
                            The court granted this motion and rendered judgment dismissing the case
                            on May 6 last. The plaintiff, through her attorney, excepted and gave
                            notice of an appeal to the court of appeals (supreme court) of Colorado.
                            The appeal was granted upon condition that the plaintiff files an appeal
                            bond. It <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0389"/>appears that the
                            plaintiff did not perfect the appeal, however, but instead, on May 11,
                            filed a motion for a new trial in the same court, one of the grounds of
                            such motion being that the judgment was in violation of the treaty of
                            1871 between the United States and Italy, the pertinent portions of
                            which are as follows: <list>

                        <p>On June 29 last the court denied the plaintiff’s motion for a new
                            trial.</p>
                        <p>The plaintiff, through her attorneys, appeals to the Italian Government
                            to make demand upon the Government of the United States for the sum of
                            $5,000, “for which,” they allege, “she was deprived the right of
                            litigation in violation of the said treaty between the two countries,
                            and such other or further sum as may be just and equitable for the
                            affront and indignity which she received by being thus discriminated
                            against.”</p>
                        <p>You submit the matter to this Department for such measures as the Federal
                            Government may see fit to take.</p>
                        <p>In the opinion of the Department the case, in its present stage, is not
                            one for diplomatic intervention, for the reason that the plaintiff has
                            not exhausted her judicial remedy. It frequently happens that litigants
                            are denied rights by the decisions of inferior courts and are obliged,
                            in order to establish such rights, to carry the case to the courts of
                            last resort.</p>
                        <p>The plaintiff in the present case should pursue the judicial remedy
                            afforded by our laws, perfecting her appeal to the court of appeals (the
                            supreme court) of Colorado, and, if necessary thereafter, by appropriate
                            proceedings, bring the case before the Supreme Court of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, under the laws of the United States, the circuit courts of
                            the United States have original jurisdiction of civil suits like the
                            present one to which an alien is a party. It is suggested for the
                            consideration of the attorneys of the plaintiff whether an original suit
                            should not be brought in the circuit court of the United States for the
                            district of Colorado.</p>
                        <p>Until the remedy of recourse to the civil tribunals has been exhausted by
                            the plaintiff and justice is finally denied her, there appears to be no
                            ground for the presentation of a diplomatic claim.</p>

                            acknowledge the receipt of your excellency’s note of August 24, 1901,
                            No. 704, relative to the claim of Mrs. Fenice Ferrara, and to thank you
                            therefor. It is stated in said note that, in the present state of the
                            question, the Department of State is of the opinion that there is no
                            ground for diplomatic intervention, inasmuch as the claimant has not
                            exhausted all lega, means of redress.</p>
                        <p>The contents of the aforesaid note has been communicated to Mrs. Ferrara
                            and her lawyer by the royal consul at Denver, and said lawyer has sent a
                            letter to the consul containing certain explanations which appear to be
                            of special importance.</p>
                        <p>I decided to lay the matter before the Department of State only after a
                            careful examination of the evidence produced in the case, from which I
                            thought that there appeared to be no doubt that the claimant had in
                            reality exhausted all legal means for the assertion of her rights before
                            the courts. The letter<note n="a" xml:id="d290fna">Not printed.</note>

                        <p>It consequently becomes my duty again to submit the case to your

                            stated in the letter of Mrs. Ferrara’s legal adviser, and the inquiries
                            which you will think proper to make on the subject, will cause the
                            question to be decided in favor of an unfortunate woman who, in addition
                            to having lost her husband, who was killed while at work, has been left
                            in the most abject poverty.</p>

                            receipt of your note of the 3d instant, with inclosed letter from M. J.
                            Galligan, attorney for Mrs. Fenice Ferrara, relative to her complaint
                            that she had been denied justice in the district court of Pueblo,
                            Colo.</p>
                        <p>The Department has given careful consideration both to your note and its
                            inclosure, but without being led thereby to alter the conclusion
                            expressed in its note of August 24 that Mrs. Ferrara had not exhausted
                            her judicial remedies and hence that there was no ground for the
                            presentation of a diplomatic claim in her behalf.</p>
                        <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0391"/>
                        <p>Mr. Galligan states that when Mrs. Ferrara was denied the right to
                            prosecute her action in the district court of the State her judicial
                            remedy was practically exhausted; and he asserts, also, that she was, by
                            her poverty, practically prevented from taking further proceedings.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s note of August 24 points out the particulars in which
                            the plaintiff’ failed to avail herself of the judicial remedy afforded
                            her when the district court denied the motion for a new trial.</p>
                        <p>The poverty of the plaintiff, which, it is alleged, prevented her from
                            taking the necessary legal proceedings to establish her rights, affords
                            no basis for a claim of a denial of justice.</p>
                        <p>It is a rule practiced not only by many American courts, but also by
                            those of other civilized states, that the plaintiff shall, as a
                            condition to the prosecution of his case, give a bond to secure the
                            costs (caution judicatum solvi) he may thereby occasion. Such
                            requirement can not be treated as a denial of free access to the courts,
                            nor as a denial of justice giving ground for diplomatic intervention.
                            Nor in any case could this Government be expected to perform the
                            function of parens patriæ by providing even a meritorious foreign
                            claimant with pecuniary aid which his own government might decline to
                            afford. Much less could the United States be expected to pay outright
                            this claim, considering that the Government was not in the remotest
                            degree connected with the transaction out of which the claim arose, and
                            that justice has not been judicially denied.</p>
                        <p>“The stranger, in all countries, is subject to the local law, as respects
                            either the prosecution or defense of his case. In both aspects, he
                            stands upon the same footing as the natives, save la caution judicatum
                            solvi, very frequently imposed upon the alien plaintiff.” (2 Calvo, Int.
                            Law, sec. 865.)</p>
                        <p>“Though the plaintiff foreigner be thus allowed to bring his suit, he is,
                            by the laws of the States, compelled to give bail (fournir caution) for
                            costs and damages.” (4 Phillimore, Int. Law, p. 643.)</p>
                        <p>While the Department has before enunciated its views in this case, it has
                            been at pains to set forth fully in this note the grounds of its
                            decision, which is so fully sustained by reason and authority, that it
                            should be considered as final.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose herewith a
                            copy of a note addressed by me to the Japanese minister of foreign
                            affairs concerning the registration of transfers by assignment of titles
                            to property held under perpetual leases in the foreign settlements of
                            the country.</p>
                        <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0396"/>
                        <p>It seems to me that the requirement of payment, as a revenue to the
                            Government, of 2½ per cent of the value of any property held under a
                            perpetual lease, confirmed by the treaty, is inadmissible—that such a
                            burden placed upon the property should not be borne by the assignee, who
                            should stand in the same position in respect to such property, in all
                            respects, as the original holder.</p>
                        <p>That a title to property under a perpetual lease should be registered as
                            a superficies, thereby restricting the uses of the property, and,
                            perhaps, the duration of its use, seems to me clearly inadmissible, as
                            it certainly would change the conditions contained in the original
                            lease.</p>
                        <p>Though I may possibly be in error in my position in respect to the
                            registration tax of 2½ per cent of the value of the property since there
                            is no law compelling an assignee to register, I am confident that I am
                            correct in my opinion as to the registration of property as a perpetual
                            superficies being in violation of treaty stipulations in respect of such
                            property.</p>
                        <p>Awaiting notification of the decision of the Japanese Government in reply
                            to my note, I have the honor to ask instructions upon the questions
                            involved, that I may make no mistake should I insist upon the Japanese
                            Government recognizing the correctness of the position I have already
                            taken.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the brief conversations
                                we have had recently in respect of the registration tax of 2½ per
                                cent upon the value of property held by foreigners in the respective
                                foreign settlements in Japan under perpetual leases by the
                                Government, which, as I am informed, is required by the registering
                                officers to be paid in registering any transfer or assignment of
                                such leases; and also in respect of such registration of such
                                perpetual leases being required to be made as perpetual superficies,
                                I have thought it best to express to your excellency in writing, in
                                short, some views touching these matters now entertained by me.</p>
                            <p>By the stipulations made in Article XVII of the treaty between the
                                United States and Japan in respect of the several foreign
                                settlements whereby such settlements are incorporated with the
                                respective Japanese communes, it appears that existing leases in
                                perpetuity in foreign settlements must be confirmed, and that any
                                new conditions whatever imposed by the Government are in
                                contravention of the rights of the holders of real property under
                                such leases. If I correctly understand the full import of the
                                foregoing stipulations, the 2½ per cent of the value of the property
                                so held, if imposed in registering a transfer of title, is a tax
                                upon the property not contemplated, and, as it would seem, is
                                inadmissible. The imposition of such a tax by so much reduces, in
                                effect, the value of the property and changes the original
                                conditions of the lease itself, which stipulates a certain sum to be
                                paid annually to the Government—an annual tax upon the land, and the
                                only tax, as it appears to me (except certain municipal taxes
                                provided for in the leases themselves and in the agreements entered
                                into between the Government and the representatives of the treaty
                                powers), that, under the provisions of the treaty, can rightfully be
                                levied upon it by the Government. It seems that the leaseholder
                                fully complies with the terms of the contract of lease made between
                                the Japanese Government and himself when he annually pays his
                                stipulated rent; and in registering a transfer or assignment of a
                                perpetual lease, such additional sum to be paid to the Government by
                                the assignee on the value of the property so transferred, though
                                called a registration tax, is an additional tax upon the property
                                for revenue, which, however, would not be the case if a fixed
                                registration fee only was required, without regard to value, upon
                                all transfers of property alike in compensation for the work done in
                                registering, in which no additional income to the Government from
                                the property was to be derived.</p>
                            <p>I may add that while the forms of the deeds of title giving leases of
                                perpetuity in the foreign settlements vary in their wording in some
                                nonessential particulars, the titles in all cases are granted by the
                                Government not only to the original holders, <pb n="317"
                                    xml:id="pg_317" facs="0397"/>but, in terms, to their heirs and
                                assigns as well, and, as I conceive, no tax should be imposed by the
                                Government upon the heirs or assigns of the original lease in
                                addition to that imposed upon the original lessee. It may be claimed
                                that the registration of a transfer of an assignment of title to an
                                assignee is not made obligatory by law and is to be registered or
                                not at the option of the assignee; but to protect his title against
                                a third party (who through fraud by the original holder of the
                                property might acquire a second assignment of title which would be
                                good if first registered), he must have his assignment registered
                                for his protection and is thereupon compelled to pay 2½ per cent of
                                the value of the property not contemplated in making the original
                                grant of the title, which was made, as already stated, not only to
                                the original holder but to his heirs or assigns, thus, in my view,
                                imposing in effect an additional condition upon the title confirmed
                                under the treaty.</p>
                            <p>The registration of such perpetual leases at the Saibansho by which,
                                if I am correctly informed, such leases are to be registered as
                                perpetual superficies, will also, in my opinion, change the
                                conditions of the original contracts of lease, inasmuch as a
                                superficies, if I correctly understand the meaning of that term,
                                restricts the holders of such a lease to uses of the land in certain
                                respects, and. in some contingencies, though declared perpetual,
                                will restrict its duration also, and consequently impairs the value
                                of the property. By the terms set out in the original perpetual
                                leases the leaseholders have the perpetual use of the lands for all
                                purposes whatever and for all time, provided they keep up their
                                annual payments as stipulated in the original contracts of
                                lease.</p>
                            <p>Knowing that your excellency’s Government does not intend or desire
                                to put any additional burden upon citizens of the United States
                                holding property in the foreign settlements under their perpetual
                                leases not warranted by the treaty between the two countries, I have
                                the honor to submit to your excellency the foregoing statement for
                                such consideration as the merits of the questions involved will

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my dispatch No. 364 of the
                            4th instant, concerning the registration tax of 2½ per cent of the value
                            of property held in the foreign settlements, under perpetual leases,
                            required to be paid on registering transfers of such leases, I have the
                            honor to call attention to the fact that the laws of Japan in respect to
                            real property held under perpetual lease or otherwise are peculiar,
                            especially in this, that land and buildings upon the land are regarded
                            as separate and distinct property, and that a sale or transfer of lease
                            of land does not include structures upon it as a matter of course, but
                            may be sold or transferred apart from the structures and the structures
                            likewise apart from the land.</p>
                        <p>My note to the minister of foreign affairs, it will be observed, makes no
                            reference to the registration tax upon the value of the buildings that
                            may have been erected by the lessees, but only upon the value of the
                            lands for the use of which perpetual leases were granted by the
                            Government. That, under the general law applying as well to Japanese
                            subjects as to foreigners, I could rightfully claim exemption from such
                            tax upon the value of the buildings, I had so much doubt that I omitted
                            to do so, though I understand that some of the representatives here of
                            other countries make that contention as well as for the exemption of the
                            tax upon transfers of perpetual leases of the lands.</p>
                        <p>Thinking it proper to make the above explanatory statements to avoid any
                            possible misunderstanding as to the extent of the claim of exemption
                            from the registration tax presented by me to the Japanese

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            dispatches Nos. 364 and 365, of the 4th and 6th ultimo, respectively,
                            concerning the registration tax of 24½ per cent of the value of property
                            held in the foreign settlements in Japan under perpetual leases required
                            to be paid on registering transfers of such leases.</p>
                        <p>With the former dispatch you inclose a copy of your note to the Japanese
                            minister for foreign affairs, maintaining that such a tax is not
                            warranted by the treaty between the United States and Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Department concurs in your view that under Article XVII of our treaty
                            with Japan existing leases in perpetuity are to be confirmed without
                            other conditions or burdens than those imposed by existing leases at the
                            date of the treaty. All lands previously granted free of rent for the
                            public purposes of the settlements remain free. In the confirmation of
                            leases no change in vested rights can be effected by requiring them to
                            be registered as “perpetual superficies,” if such would be the effect.
                            But in the assignment of leases between private parties for private
                            purposes citizens of the United States are subject to the same
                            registration fee or charge as is imposed on Japanese subjects, unless
                            the original leases stipulate to the contrary. This is indicated by
                            Article II of the treaty.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of instruction No. 260, of the 6th ultimo, in reply to my
                            dispatches Nos. 364 and 365, of the 4th and 6th of October last, in
                            respect to perpetual leases in foreign settlements in Japan being
                            confirmed, under the treaty, without other conditions being imposed than
                            are prescribed in existing leases, stating that, in the confirmation of
                            such leases, no change in vested rights can be effected by requiring
                            them to be registered as perpetual superficies, if such would be the
                            effect, thus approving the position taken by me in that regard.
                            Concerning the assignment of such leases, however, I am instructed that,
                            as between private parties for private purposes, citizens of the United
                            States are subject to the same registration fee or charge as is imposed
                            upon Japanese subjects, unless the original leases stipulate to the
                            contrary.</p>
                        <p>I now have the honor to report that by imperial ordinance (copy inclosed)
                            the Japanese Government has so amended the law of registration as to
                            recognize that perpetual leases of property in foreign settlements can
                            be registered as such without change, instead of as perpetual
                            superficies as heretofore required, thus substantially though indirectly
                            conceding my claim in that particular.</p>
                        <p>In respect to the requirement that a registration tax of 2½ per cent on
                            value to be paid by the assignee of a perpetual lease in foreign
                            settlements between private parties, I infer from a conversation which I
                            have had with the minister of foreign affairs that such registration <pb
                                n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0399"/>tax is not to be
                            enforced—conceding my contention that such tax ought not to be required
                            to be paid in consideration of the stipulations of the leases themselves
                            and the provisions of Article XVII of the treaty—though it will be
                            enforced upon registration of mortgages and other liens on such
                            property.</p>

                                follows:</p>

                                by the parties concerned, or if a notification concerning a

                                without delay, give notice thereof to the registry office within

                            29th ultimo, relating to the imperial ordinance recently published
                            concerning the law of registration of land title, permitting perpetual
                            leases of property in <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0400"/>the
                            foreign settlements to be registered as such without change, I have the
                            honor to state that in an interview with his excellency the minister for
                            foreign affairs yesterday I learned that the requirement of the
                            ordinance that the registration of such leases or transfers thereof in
                            the chihōchō (local government office) instead of the registry office
                            proper, as also the use of the term perpetual lease” as synonymous with
                            “perpetual superficies “was because the law had made obligatory the
                            payment of 2½ per cent of value as a registration tax or charge on such
                            property at the registry office, and the law did not recognize the
                            registration of perpetual leases as such. As an ordinance could not
                            directly repeal or annul the provisions of the law in those respects, it
                            became necessary in order to meet the objections made by me and others
                            to indirectly by ordinance recognize perpetual leases in parenthesis
                            only and by changing the place of registration to relieve perpetual
                            leaseholders from the registration charge of the 2½ per cent of
                            value.</p>
                        <p>I am informed by our consul-general at Yokohama that registration of
                            perpetual leases as such and transfers thereof at the local government

                            as a matter of some importance, I have the honor to inclose herewith a
                            copy of resolutions adopted at a meeting of foreign residents in
                            Yokohama concerning the registration of titles of perpetual leases in
                            the former foreign settlements there, together with a copy of a
                            communication from Mr. John Lindsley, an American resident, transmitting
                            the resolutions to Consul-General John F. Gowey; also the dispatch
                            (copy) of the consul-general in forwarding them, and also a copy of my
                            instruction to the consul-general in respect to the resolutions and the
                            request made by Mr. Lindsley.</p>
                        <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0401"/>
                        <p>Considering the information I had received as to the attitude of our
                            people in Yokohama concerning the registration of titles of perpetual
                            leases, upon the promulgation of the imperial ordinance No. 458 of the
                            27th of December last, which, at the time, was published and discussed
                            in the newspapers, and the fact that no complaint had reached me, and no
                            inquiry had been made in respect to the effect of the ordinance, I had
                            assumed that the ordinance was regarded by them as measurably
                            satisfactory, and was surprised that the American residents there should
                            join with foreigners of other nationalities in passing the resolutions
                            and that my efforts with the Imperial Government should be solicited in
                            their behalf, without first hearing what, if anything, had already been
                            done by me in the direction of their suggestions.</p>
                        <p>While the imperial ordinance No. 458 of December 27 last (copy inclosed
                            with my despatch of the 29th of December, No. 392), in providing for the
                            registration of titles of perpetual leases as “superficies” (perpetual
                            leases), was not entirely satisfactory, yet, as stated in my dispatch
                            No. 392, I regarded it as indirectly in accord with treaty
                            provision.</p>
                        <p>I understand that the resolutions do not express the views of all
                            American residents holding titles of perpetual leases in Yokohama,
                            though they probably do of a majority of them, as the meeting passing
                            the resolutions, I am informed, was fairly representative.</p>

                            <p>It is resolved by this meeting of land renters of the former foreign
                                settlement of Yokohama that the following facts be brought to the
                                notice of the Imperial Japanese Government: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>That although the revised treaties provide that the
                                        existing Government leases in perpetuity of
                                        foreign-settlement property shall be confirmed, steps have
                                        not yet been taken by the Government to confirm them, and
                                        the laws of Japan appear to contemplate their compulsory
                                        conversion into a new and different kind of right, which is
                                        called “superficies.”</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>That under existing laws the right of perpetual lease is
                                        not recognized, and since the coming into operation of the
                                        revised treaties the holders of such leases have been unable
                                        to sell or mortgage their land except on the terms of
                                        allowing the leasehold interest to be registered as a
                                        “superficies,” which they have been and are unwilling to
                                        do.</item>
                                    <label>3.</label>
                                    <item>That the nonrecognition of what foreigners conceive to be
                                        a right plainly secured to them by their title deeds and by
                                        treaty has resulted in a general feeling of insecurity, and
                                        in stopping all sales and mortgages of former
                                        foreign-settlement property and is threatening such property
                                        with a very serious depreciation in value.</item>
                                    <label>4.</label>
                                    <item>That in order to remedy the evils of the situation and to
                                        restore confidence it is most desirable that the Imperial
                                        Japanese Government shall at once confirm the aforesaid
                                        leases in perpetuity and make all necessary provisions for
                                        their recognition by law, and for the registration of them
                                        under a separate designation.</item>
                                    <label>5.</label>
                                    <item>That properties held by foreigners in the former foreign
                                        settlements have been made subject to new conditions and
                                        taxes and charges from which in the opinion of this meeting
                                        the revised treaties were intended to exempt them.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>And it is further resolved that copies of the foregoing resolutions
                                be forwarded to His Imperial Majesty’s minister for foreign affairs
                                through the usual channels.</p>

                                passing the resolutions were not aware, it would seem, of what
                                action I had taken to secure them protection of their property
                                rights guaranteed by treaty, since, until the receipt of the
                                resolutions and letter accompanying your dispatch, I have had no
                                inquiry from any of them for information as to what I had done or
                                proposed to do for their protection or request to take any action
                                whatever in that respect.</p>
                            <p>That our fellow-citizens in Yokohama may know of what attention I
                                have been giving to this important matter I proceed to give a resume
                                of what has been done and the real situation in respect to
                                registration of land titles as I understand it.</p>
                            <p>In September last, learning that a British subject holding a
                                perpetual lease in Yokohama in the foreign settlement had been
                                denied its recognition as such and was required to have it
                                registered, if at all, as a superficies, anticipating that the same
                                course would be taken in respect to registration of titles of
                                American citizens, I addressed a note to the minister of foreign
                                affairs, calling attention to the treaty stipulations prohibiting
                                the imposition of any condition whatever in addition to those <pb
                                    n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0403"/>set out in the leases
                                themselves, in which note I claimed that the registration of such
                                perpetual leases at the Saibansho, by which, if I was rightly
                                informed, such leases were to be registered as perpetual
                                superficies, would, in my opinion, change the conditions of the
                                original contracts of lease, inasmuch as a superficies, as I
                                understood, restricted the holders of such lease to uses of the land
                                in certain respect and—in some contingencies, though declared
                                perpetual—would restrict the duration also and consequently impair
                                the value of the property.</p>
                            <p>Before addressing the official note to the minister of foreign
                                affairs I had in person earnestly expressed my views as to the
                                registration of perpetual leases as superficies, and since have had
                                several interviews with the minister, expressing my opinion of such
                                a requirement as violative of treaty provisions. In all our
                                interviews the minister has expressed himself as fully conceding
                                that perpetual leases and their transfers must be registered without
                                change of their conditions.</p>
                            <p>On the promulgation of imperial ordinance No. 458, concerning the
                                registration of perpetual leases in question, he assured me then, as
                                he has since, that, by that ordinance requiring such leases to be
                                registered as superficies (perpetual leases), the Imperial
                                Government made no change in the character of the titles whatever;
                                that the courts must recognize the ordinance as providing for the
                                registration of perpetual leases without change of conditions of
                                such leases by the registration therein provided for; and that he
                                would give me in an official note an explanation of the purpose and
                                real effect of the ordinance as intended and understood by his
                                Government, which note would be a duplicate of that already sent to
                                the British minister. Awaiting the receipt of the minister’s note,
                                which I now have, has caused some delay in acknowledging the receipt
                                of your dispatch and in responding to the accompanying resolutions
                                and the request of Mr. Lindsley.</p>
                            <p>To be accurate in giving the views of the Japanese Government in this
                                matter, I quote from a translation of the minister’s note as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p>“The Imperial Government is of the opinion that, though the rights of
                                perpetual leases are registered as superficies according to the
                                above-mentioned imperial ordinance (No. 329), such action is not in
                                violation of the treaty; because it is provided in article 45 of the
                                law for the operation of the civil code that, ‘As to a superficies
                                created for an alien or a foreign legal person the provisions of the
                                civil code apply only so far as it is not otherwise provided by
                                treaty or regulation;’ therefore the right of perpetual lease, i.
                                e., the right of superficies created for foreigners, is considered a
                                kind of special superficies, and it is clear that it is not the
                                right of superficies according to the civil code.</p>
                            <p>“Again, the interpretation given by the Imperial Government is, that
                                even after the right of perpetual lease has been registered in
                                accordance with the above imperial ordinance, the said title-deed
                                has the same validity as before. However, that imperial ordinance
                                was amended by imperial ordinance No. 458, of December 27, of last
                                year, as appeared in the Official Gazette (copy of which is herewith
                                inclosed), in which the words ‘perpetual lease’ were specially
                                inserted in brackets after the word ‘superficies,’ by which it is
                                made still more clear that the so-called right of ‘superficies’ is
                                the right of ‘perpetual lease.’ It is provided therein also that the
                                transfer of a perpetual lease can not be set up against a third
                                party unless the fact of such transfer is indorsed upon the title
                                deed, and that indorsements of transfer hitherto entered upon the
                                title deed shall have the same effect as an indorsement made in
                                accordance with the above ordinance. The validity of the title deeds
                                having thus been confirmed, there is, in my opinion, no room left
                                for such doubts as are expressed above.”</p>
                            <p>While the fact that the ordinance does not simply state that these
                                titles are to be registered as perpetual leases by omitting the term
                                superfices altogether may be disappointing, yet the fear expressed
                                in the resolutions that the question may be raised in the courts as
                                to whether such registration may not in effect impair the titles of
                                perpetual leases seems to be met by the assurances and
                                interpretation given by the Imperial Government, and should such
                                question by any possibility be so raised treaty stipulations will
                                control. No ordinance in respect to registration of titles can
                                successfully impair rights specifically guaranteed by treaty; and in
                                registering titles, as prescribed by the ordinance of December 27
                                last (No. 458), American citizens do not lose thereby any treaty
                                right in respect to property so registered, the titles to which were
                                originally guaranteed by the Imperial Government.</p>
                            <p>On communicating to American holders of perpetual leases in Yokohama
                                what has been done the last four months concerning the registration
                                of their land titles, I am confident that they will appreciate the
                                fact that I have not been unmindful of their interests or have
                                failed to make proper representations to the Imperial Government in
                                their behalf in respect of their property rights as guaranteed by
                                treaty.</p>
                            <p>Having already, before the receipt of the resolutions accompanying
                                your dispatch, <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0404"/>in

                                can do more at this time, or hereafter, than I have already done,
                                unless some additional reason should appear requiring further

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            dispatch No. 394, of the 12th ultimo, in which you report that in an
                            interview with the Japanese minister for foreign affairs, you have
                            learned that the requirement of the ordinances that the registration of
                            perpetual leases of property in the foreign settlements or transfers
                            thereof should be made in the chihosho (local government office),
                            instead of the registry office proper, as also the use of the term
                            “perpetual lease” as synonymous with “perpetual superficies” were
                            because the law had made obligatory the payment of 2½ per cent of value
                            as a registration tax or charge upon such property at the registry
                            office, and also because the law did not recognize the registration of
                            perpetual leases as such, and that as an ordinance could not directly
                            repeal or annul the provisions of the law in those respects, it became
                            necessary in order to meet the objections made by you and others, to
                            indirectly, by ordinance, recognize perpetual leases in parenthesis only
                            and by changing the place of registration to relieve perpetual lease
                            holders from the registration charge of the 2½ per cent of value.</p>
                        <p>In reply I have to say that as a practical solution of the difficulty,
                            the course described is unobjectionable, so far as appears, especially
                            so, as it is not shown that this solution works any hardships.</p>

                            length many reasons for complaint that the Japanese Government have
                            failed to protect American perpetual leaseholders of property in the

                        <p>1. In respect of the first ground of complaint, as summarized above, I
                            have the honor to refer to my previous dispatches upon that subject—No.
                            364 of October 4 and No. 392 of December 29, 1899; also No. 394 of
                            January 12 and No. 398 of February 5, last, and inclosures; also to the
                            inclosed copy of a note of the minister of foreign affairs to the
                            minister of France; also the inclosed cuttings<note n="a"
                                xml:id="d306fnc">Not printed.</note> from most of the newspapers
                            published by foreigners in Yokohama and the leading newspaper of Kobe,
                            which in respect to this matter are supposed to voice to a large degree
                            the prevailing opinion of foreign residents in those cities, though not
                            to be taken as evidence in coming to a conclusion on the merits of the
                            case, and all except the Herald regard the course taken by the
                            Government as substantially complying with treaty provisions, to wit:
                            the Japan Weekly Mail of February 3 and 17, last (the latter a
                            republication from the Daily Mail of February 12 and 14); the Daily Mail
                            of the 2d and 5th ultimo; the Japan Daily Herald of February 5 and 12,
                            last; the Daily Advertiser of the 1st ultimo, all published in Yokohama,
                            and the Kobe Chronicle of the 5th ultimo.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I also respectfully refer in particular to
                            “Regulations relating to foreigners in Japan,” a copy of which
                            accompanied my dispatch No. 338 of July 29, last, under the head of
                            “Registry of immovables” (imperial ordinances Nos. 329 and 333 of July
                            7, last), in which is prescribed the books of registry of land and other
                            immovables; and with the same dispatch a “Notification of the department
                            of justice (No. 41 of July 10, last) respecting registration; also the

                            and 1829, from George H. Scidmore, esq., deputy consul-general at
                            Yokohama, made on my request. (Mr. Scidmore <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326"

                            Asiatic Society, with Mr. Lindsley and Mr. Booth, who present these
                            complaints. Mr. Scidmore is regarded a good lawyer. He has been in the
                            consular service in Yokohama since May, 1876, as consular clerk and then
                            deputy consul-general, and has a good knowledge in respect to what he
                            reports.)</p>
                        <p>Since the Japanese Government itself executed the leases and, so long as
                            such leases should be held by foreigners, guaranteed their perpetuity,
                            and in case such leases should be transferred to Japanese subjects
                            (imperial ordinance 333 with dispatch 338) they are to acquire actual
                            ownership—which latter fact may be taken as additional evidence of the
                            recognition on the part of the Government of their perpetuity—and since
                            actual ownership is now vested in the Government, it would seem that, so
                            long as such leases were held by foreigners, no one but the Government
                            itself could question the rights guaranteed by it, independent of the
                            fact of treaty stipulations to hold inviolate and confirm all rights
                            guaranteed by the terms of such lease.</p>
                        <p>Hence, in consideration of imperial ordinance 458 and the interpretation
                            put upon it by the Japanese Government, as given by the minister of
                            foreign affairs, together with the ordinances and regulations above
                            cited, also the facts and opinions presented in inclosures herewith,
                            have or have not leases held in perpetuity been confirmed as required by
                            treaty?</p>
                        <p>Can rights under leases held in perpetuity, entered in the register
                            provided for the registration of superficies, and entered as
                            “superficies (perpetual leases”) be impaired by that method incident to
                            registration, when the Government, the party of the first part, has
                            guaranteed the rights specified in the leases and has declared by
                            imperial ordinance that method of registration and has interpreted it to
                            mean full compliance with treaty provisions in respect of such leases?
                            If they are to be so impaired, the claimants are right in their
                            contention.</p>
                        <p>What force there may be in the claim that by the expiration of the
                            present treaty the Government or any individual who may possibly at that
                            time Wave acquired the ownership of land held under perpetual lease will
                            interpose in any way, so far as to work a denial of any right solemnly
                            guaranteed by the Government in the leases themselves, seems to be
                            speculative.</p>
                        <p>2. Concerning the second cause of complaint, the “notification (No. 41)
                            of the department of justice” in Article II (with my dispatch No. 338 of
                            July 29 last), in carrying out the law of registration in respect of
                            land and buildings being separate and distinct kinds of property to be
                            separately registered, applying to foreigners and Japanese alike,
                            provides that “The local court shall prepare land registers relating to
                            foreigners and foreign juridical persons and registers of buildings
                            relating to the rights of foreigners and foreign juridical persons.”</p>
                        <p>It is claimed that the buildings, equally with the lands, are included in
                            the word “property” in the provision of Article XVII of the treaty with
                            the United States providing for the confirmation of existing leases;
                            that any transfer of a perpetual lease of the land in conformity with
                            the laws in the United States and in other countries carries with it all
                            buildings upon it as a matter of course, as is clearly to be understood
                            by a proper construction of treaty provisions. That the requirement in
                            case of transfer of property, that the land and buildings are to <pb
                                n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0407"/>be registered separately and in
                            separate offices, will cause much inconvenience and vexation to foreign
                            leaseholders I have no doubt; but the question arises whether Japanese
                            or foreign laws should control in this respect. I think all foreigners
                            object and naturally to this requirement as a hardship and an annoyance
                            apart from any charge for registering a transfer of buildings. (See
                            Scidmore’s statement No. 1822, above referred to, paragraph 8.) But in
                            event that objection should be removed and land and buildings were
                            included in one instrument of transfer and entered at one office in the
                            same register, and the charge of 2½ per cent on value of buildings as
                            now required to be paid should still be imposed, the most important
                            cause of complaint would still exist, because the chief contention is
                            that the buildings should equally be exempt from any form of taxation as
                            the lands.</p>
                        <p>3. This leads to the third matter of complaint: That any tax whatever,
                            whether the charge of 2½ per cent of value of buildings on transfer of
                            lease, or any other public charge or tax on buildings for municipal
                            purposes, is inadmissible under the treaty, and business and other taxes
                            to be levied are cumulative and a hardship.</p>
                        <p>To fully understand what basis there is for such contention in respect to
                            “house tax,” I beg to refer to the inclosed copy of the “Land
                            regulations for the port of Yokohama,” the only regulations for foreign
                            settlements not contained in the book of “Treaties and conventions of
                            Japan,” which book is presumed to be in the library of the State
                            Department; also copies of two titles of perpetual leases<note n="a"
                                xml:id="d306fne">Not printed.</note> of property in Yokohama. (Forms
                            of such leases at other ports are to be found in the book of “Treaties,
                            etc.”)</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that the regulations of the several foreign
                            settlements vary in terms, as also do the conditions set out in the
                            forms of perpetual leases. In Yokohama and Nagasaki failure to comply
                            with the conditions of annual payment of rent, etc., forfeits the land,
                            and in addition the buildings thereon; while in Tokyo, Kobe, and Osaka,
                            in case of failure of the annual payment of rent, proceedings are to be
                            instituted against the leaseholder. Since in Yokohama and Nagasaki the
                            leaseholders were required by regulations to erect buildings, and in
                            case of default in the annual payment of rent they were to forfeit their
                            leases and their properties, including buildings, were to revert to the
                            Government, which fact is argued to be an additional reason to claim
                            that the buildings are a part of the property and should, under the
                            treaty, be exempt from taxation as well as is the land, may it not be to
                            some degree reasonable and as fair, perhaps, to suppose that this
                            provision was made because, under Japanese law, the land and buildings
                            are distinct and separate properties, and the disposition of the land
                            without specification as to the buildings does not include the
                            buildings? And the buildings, being the absolute properties of
                            leaseholders while the lands are not, may it not be inferred that the
                            Japanese Government provided that on reentering into possession of the
                            land the buildings thereupon should also revert as a penalty for the
                            nonperformance of contracts by the leaseholders?</p>
                        <p>How much force should be given to the contention that since, in Article
                            XVII of the treaty with the United States, the word “property “is used
                            as applying to leases held by foreigners in perpetuity and the word
                            “land” as applying to grants in perpetuity for public purposes, “reveals
                            the fact in the one case that land and something <pb n="328"
                                xml:id="pg_328" facs="0408"/>attached to it was meant” and land only
                            in the other, would seem to depend upon the intention of the high
                            contracting parties to the treaty and the interpretation the two

                                        (fudō-san, the word used in the Japanese text of the treaty
                                        with France). All other things are movables. Obligations
                                        performable to bearer are deemed to be movable.</item>

                                        the thing attached becomes an accessory. The accessory thing
                                        is subject to all dispositions made of the principal

                                        an accessory, but this does not affect the rights of a
                                        person who by virtue of a special title has attached the

                            discussion, buildings are accessory to the land. Hence, under Japanese
                            law as well as treaty stipulations, a transfer of a lease held in
                            perpetuity necessarily, unless stipulated to the contrary, carries with
                            it a transfer of the buildings, and for that reason no separate
                            registration nor any charge therefor should be imposed upon them as
                            separate and distinct properties. As to whether such argument is sound,
                            as it would be under the laws of the United States perhaps, the opinions
                            of some Japanese authorities will throw some light.</p>
                        <p>Interpreting article 87 of the civil code, Dr. Umé, professor of law in
                            the Imperial University of Tokyo, and member of the code investgation
                            committee, states: “An accessory has two necessary requisites, according
                            to this article (87): 1. It must be for the constant use of its
                            principal thing, as a key to a box or a bucket to a well. A thing used
                            for a time is not an accessory, as a table or chair, to a house. 2. An
                            accessory must be owned by the owner of the principal thing; that is to
                            say, the owner of the two must be the same, else the accessory can not
                            follow the disposal of the thing to which it is attached. This article
                            of course shows the general rule that an accessory follows the principal
                            thing. If there should be any contract or promise to the contrary, such
                            contract or promise must be followed.”</p>
                        <p>Also the opinion of Mr. Okamatsu, lecturer on the civil code at the Tokyo
                            Law School, the Meiji Law School, the Semmon Gakko, etc.: “To be an
                            accessory a thing must fulfill the following five conditions: 1. It must
                            be another thing than the principal thing. 2. It must be attached to
                            another thing. 3. An accessory must belong to the owner of the principal
                            thing. This provision is not found in foreign codes; but if the tenant
                            of the land or the occupant of a building attaches to the land or
                            building his own things for his own use, it is unjust that he should
                            thereby forfeit his ownership of the things so attached. 4. An accessory
                            must be for constant use. 5. The constant use must be for the sake of
                            the principal thing.”</p>
                        <p>Interpreting article 242 of the civil code, Mr. Okamatsu states, after
                            summarizing the provisions of the laws of most foreign countries
                            relating to land and buildings thereon: “To acquire an accessory
                            immovable with the principal immovable according to this article (242),
                            the said accessory must fulfill the following conditions: 1. It must be
                            attached fixedly and permanently to the immovable. 2. It must be
                            attached to the immovable as an accessory (subordinate) to it. An
                            ‘accessory’ (subordinate) here means a thing that is joined to another
                                <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0409"/>thing, is used for the same
                            economical purpose, and can be regarded as one thing in the everyday
                            life. If, therefore, there is no relation of superior and subordinate
                            between the two immovables, and they are independent of each other, then
                            they are two separate things, both in fact and in law, and can not be
                            said to be attached to an immovable. <hi rend="italic">Take, for
                                example, a house. It is in nature attached to the land. But the
                                ideas of our country up to the present day have regarded it as a
                                thing independent of the land and not as belonging to the land.
                                Hence the question of attachment to an immovable can not here
                                arise.”</hi></p>
                        <p>The closing lines of the opinion of Mr. Okamatsu, in respect to article
                            242, underlined as above, if a proper interpretation of that article of
                            the code, would seem to destroy the argument of the complainants based
                            on their interpretation of the code in respect of accessories. I know of
                            no Japanese decision or opinion in conflict with the opinions of Mr.
                            Okamatsu and Dr. Umé upon the subject of accessories under Japanese
                            law.</p>
                        <p>If the interpretation of Article XVII of the treaty must be interpreted
                            in the light of and in conformity with the laws of the United States,
                            then it would seem that the argument of the complainants should hold
                            good.</p>
                        <p>Further, it will be observed that the land regulations for Yokohama
                            provide for the foreign holders of perpetual leases to levy taxes upon
                            their lands and buildings for lighting and cleaning streets and for a
                            police force. Since, under extraterritorial jurisdiction, it was
                            provided that they might tax their own property, including buildings,
                            for the purposes stated, now that their power to tax has ceased to
                            exist, can the claim that the Japanese authorities, under whose
                            jurisdiction they now are, have no right to tax their buildings for
                            municipal purposes hold good? Are foreign leaseholders, in consequence
                            of now having come under Japanese jurisdiction, free from any obligation
                            to pay taxes levied by the Japanese authorities though they may not have
                            levied a tax upon themselves as provided by the regulations while under
                            extraterritorial jurisdiction?</p>
                        <p>The French treaty with Japan is cited and Article XXI is quoted in
                            support of the claim of exemption from tax on buildings as well as land.
                            While that article of the French treaty is considered somewhat stronger
                            in expression, as implying that the word “propriétés” was intended to
                            include buildings, than Article XVII of the United States treaty, yet
                            the French minister here, who contends for exemption from the “house
                            tax,” expresses much uncertainty of success. The matter is still pending
                            and he is awaiting instructions, in doubt whether he will be supported
                            by his Government in his claim. Neither the German nor the British
                            minister has confidence of the success of such contention, and, I
                            understand, have not objected formally to the imposition of the tax on
                            buildings. Both have stated that they did not see much hope of success
                            of such claim of exemption. Meantime the Japanese Government has not
                            announced any decision upon the question.</p>
                        <p>In my dispatch No. 365, of October 6 last, it will be remembered that I
                            stated that I had made no claim of exemption from the registration tax
                            on value of buildings because of doubt of the grounds upon which to base
                            such a claim. In instruction No. 260, of November 6 last, acknowledging
                            the receipt of both that dispatch and my No. 364, of October 4, I was
                            not directed in respect of what action, if any, I was to take upon that
                            question in particular; but the clause of that instruction <pb n="330"
                                xml:id="pg_330" facs="0410"/>which stated that, “in the assignment
                            of leases between private parties for private purposes, citizens of the
                            United States are subject to the same registration fee or charge as is
                            imposed on Japanese subjects, unless the original leases specify to the
                            contrary,” I understand to mean, not only that the charges made on the
                            registration of buildings when transferred with or without the land
                            (which is hereinbefore discussed), but also that other taxes by the
                            Japanese authorities on buildings on the property of a foreign holder of
                            a perpetual lease for municipal or other purposes could be required to
                            be paid, the same as if a Japanese subject held the property instead,
                            since the leases themselves do not stipulate to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>As to the manner of estimating the value of buildings for taxation and
                            the taxes so levied being unjust, and numerous other taxes and charges a
                            hardship, there seems to be, under treaty stipulations, no legal ground
                            of complaint. The same method, as I am informed, is employed in
                            estimating the house tax of Japanese subjects and the same rate of tax
                            levied, the tax law applying to Japanese and foreigners the same. In
                            this respect it seems that no charge of discrimination against
                            foreigners can successfully be made, and it will be observed that no
                            such charge is specifically made in the memorandum of complaints.
                            Whether these taxes may be unjust, and with numerous other taxes a
                            hardship or excessive, is shown in some respects by the following
                            inclosures: The statement<note n="a" xml:id="d306fng">Not
                                printed.</note> of Mr. John McLean, vice and acting consul-general
                            of the United States at Yokohama, giving value of land and buildings
                            owned by him in the foreign concession of the Bluff; also in respect to
                            the property which is now occupied by the consulate and the taxes paid
                            thereon; also the statement of Mr. Scidmore, No. 1822, above cited, in
                            respect of the value of the property of the Grand Hotel, the Yokohama
                            Club, and the Oriental Hotel, all on the Bund and within the foreign
                            settlement, and the taxes paid on the land of each, respectively. As to
                            other taxes sought to be levied being cumulative or excessive—the
                            business tax, income tax, and other charges complained of—laws No. 32
                            and 33, inclosed with my dispatch No. 359,<note n="a" xml:id="d306fnh"
                                >Not printed.</note> of September 27, 1899, in respect of “business
                            tax” and “revised income tax law,” will furnish definite
                            information.</p>
                        <p>4. In the matter of prescriptive rights claimed to have been acquired by
                            long tenure and use of property in the foreign settlements under
                            extraterritorial jurisdiction, while my opinion is that that contention
                            is not well founded, I need not discuss the question pending instruction
                            from the Department.</p>
                        <p>5. Finally, in respect of the fifth subject of complaint—that because of
                            the failure of the Japanese Government to comply with treaty
                            obligations, about which statements of grievance in general and
                            particular are set forth and because of which it is claimed that
                            property has depreciated in value so much that no real estate
                            transactions are made—my information on inquiry is that, of American
                            residents, property holders, in Yokohama only about one-third are in
                            support of this and other complaints, and not a majority even of the
                            American Asiatic Society, for which the two gentlemen addressing me
                            speak, except the complaint touching the requirement for separate
                            registration of buildings and lands at separate offices in a transfer of
                            perpetual leases including buildings. The president of that society, Mr.
                            J. R. Morse, and Mr. Scidmore, <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0411"
                            />a member of the executive committee in whose behalf these complaints
                            are submitted, and others have personally expressed to me their
                            impatience with the course taken by the complainants in general, but
                            have submitted to it that the questions raised might, once for all, be
                            settled at the Department of State. They say that the reason for the
                            paralysis of trade in perpetual lease property is largely due to the
                            agitation by the leaseholders themselves, and that of course property
                            can not have the market value it should have when the holders discredit
                            their titles.</p>
                        <p>In remarking generally on these complaints I think I am justified in
                            saying that some of our American residents in Yokohama who hold
                            perpetual leases, together with a large proportion, perhaps a majority,
                            of property holders among the British and German subjects, have from the
                            first been opposed to treaty revision by which extraterritoriality has
                            now been abolished. They have constantly been apprehensive concerning
                            their fate when the new treaty should go into operation. They have been
                            looking for and expecting trouble under Japanese control; and it is not
                            to be wondered at when it is considered for how many years they have
                            lived in Japan but not of it, so independent and free from vexatious
                            taxes and many other burdens incident to city life in their own country.
                            They have regarded the Japanese as inferiors and now, being under the
                            control of Japanese law and Japanese officials, some of them, though
                            unwittingly no doubt, are inclined to exaggerate their troubles. Having
                            little confidence in the purposes of the Japanese Government and local
                            authorities, it is hard for them to adjust themselves to their new
                            conditions. That they already have had and will continue to have some
                            reason to complain of inefficient local officials is not to be denied;
                            but in my opinion they have no sufficient reason to suspect the good
                            faith of the Government, which seems to be earnest in the desire and
                            purpose to demonstrate to the world that Japan has not been received
                            into the family of nations too soon.</p>
                        <p>Though of some specific claims and items of complaint set forth in the
                            memorandum no special mention has been made, I think they are
                            substantially covered by my statements in respect to the various classes
                            of complaints, together with the inclosures and the laws and regulations
                            to be found at the Department.</p>
                        <p>That imperial ordinance No. 458 is disappointing, and that the term
                            “superficies” (perpetual lease) is used instead of simply “perpetual
                            lease” gives occasion of complaint because of ambiguity of definition is
                            true; and if the conclusion of the State Department should be that, in
                            consideration of treaty stipulations, there is sufficient ground for
                            further appeal to the Japanese Government for a more specific and direct
                            confirmation of leases held in perpetuity, I shall, of course, press the
                            matter with vigor, as I also shall in event of instructions to do so in
                            respect of any other of the matters of complaint. I desire to do all in
                            my power to protect American interests and that every right guaranteed
                            to them by treaty shall be made secure; and I would be pleased if it
                            were possible for American residents to remain as free from taxation as
                            they were under extraterritorial jurisdiction.</p>

                                of the current month on the subject of the title to lease in
                                perpetuity. As I told you in my letter of the 3d, the provisions of
                                the civil code which may be in conflict with those of the treaties
                                are, naturally, not applied to the title to lease in perpetuity. The
                                provision which, in article 268 of the civil code, limits the titles
                                of holders of superficies, it goes without saying, and, as a general
                                rule, all the provisions which imply conditions other than those
                                which are written in the titles to leases in perpetuity, do not
                                apply to these.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Agreeably to the request contained in
                                your letter of March 26, 1900, I have the honor to submit the
                                following in response to your questions relating to the status of
                                land tenures in the late foreign settlements of Japan:</p>
                            <p>1. Since the promulgation of the Japanese imperial ordinance No. 458,
                                of December 27, 1899, I have not heard of any instance in which
                                there has been any specific complaint by foreigners or controversy
                                with the authorities concerning the registration of transfers of
                                property.</p>
                            <p>2. It is my opinion that that ordinance, as interpreted by the
                                Japanese minister of foreign affairs, secures foreign holders of
                                property their rights under the treaties.</p>
                            <p>3. The interpretation of the Japanese Government, as given by the
                                minister for foreign affairs, of that ordinance is a reasonable
                                one.</p>
                            <p>4. The judge of the Yokohama Ku Saibancho, who ignored the treaty
                                provisions, and who apparently took the view that the civil code of
                                Japan contained all of the law applicable to such registration, has
                                very recently “resigned” and has retired to private life. What his
                                successor may do is uncertain, but in view of the requirement of the
                                ordinance that he shall register “a copy of the title deed in
                                question,” it strikes me that it is of very little importance what
                                his opinion in the matter may be. The assurance of the minister of
                                foreign affairs amounts to a pledge of the good faith of the
                                Japanese Government.</p>
                            <p>5. The civil code provisions do not, and evidently were not intended
                                to, cover the registration of the foreign settlement titles. They
                                are exceptional titles. The term “superficies,” whether alone or
                                bracketed with “perpetual lease” is unscientific and inaccurate.
                                Strictly speaking, these tenures appear to be of the nature of
                                determinable fees, but, all things considered, it is not a matter of
                                vital importance that they be known by any particular name. What is
                                of importance is that their nature or character be preserved in the
                                manner stipulated in the original title deeds from the Japanese
                                Government. This will be done, I believe, by recording “a copy of
                                the title deed in question.”</p>
                            <p>6. Your sixth question reads:</p>
                            <p>“Does a proper construction of Article XVII of the treaty between the
                                United States, or treaties of other powers, with Japan, exempt
                                foreign holders of perpetual leases in the foreign settlements from
                                any tax on buildings erected on their leased land?”</p>
                            <p>Reading Article XVII with the aid of Article II of the treaty, a fair
                                construction appears to be that the tax on buildings is payable,
                                unless we can find an exemption in a treaty with another power. The
                                treaty with France has been cited in this connection, and until the
                                French and Japanese Governments determine what and how much they
                                mean by the word “propriétés” in Article XXI, our position must
                                remain uncertain.</p>
                            <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0413"/>
                            <p>7. I have not heard of, and do not believe that there is, any unfair
                                discrimination made against foreigners in the mode of levying taxes
                                on buildings or in the amount of such tax.</p>
                            <p>8. To require a separate registration of the transfer of buildings
                                where they are sold with the land would be, in my opinion, in the
                                case of foreign-settlement property a manifest violation of
                                precedents in connection therewith; and an evasion of the intention
                                of the treaty provisions. For purposes of taxation the land and the
                                buildings may be regarded separately, but in passing title they are,
                                under American, English, and most continental laws, considered as
                                united. Previous to July 16, 1898, the date of the coming into force
                                of the civil code, there was no general law of real property in
                                Japan. Local customs prevailed, and the modes of tenure were of
                                great variety. The American treaty with Japan was promulgated in
                                1895.</p>
                            <p>9. The 2½ per cent tax on registration of transfers ought not to be
                                levied on the value of buildings if they are conveyed with
                                foreign-settlement land. If they are conveyed separately, I can see
                                no reason for their exemption from such tax. The Japanese
                                Government, by ordinance No. 458, has, in effect, conceded the
                                exemption of the land from this tax.</p>
                            <p>10. I can find no express treaty stipulation under the recent
                                extraterritorial jurisdiction whereby foreigners in Japan were
                                exempted from taxation. The Japanese Government then refrained from
                                taxing foreigners, probably under motives of policy. To enforce
                                collection in every case would have involved resort to about
                                seventeen different consular courts, and would have produced endless
                                petty squabbles and friction. Other reasons, if any, should appear
                                in the legation records.</p>
                            <p>11. I do not believe that any sovereign State would be bound to admit
                                the force of prescription as applicable to exemption from
                                taxation.</p>
                            <p>12. Between the years 1865 and 1868, by arrangement with the Japanese
                                authorities, the foreign landholders of Yokohama selected a
                                committee known as the municipal council of the foreign settlement,
                                for the purpose of regulating police, street, and other local
                                affairs. This council derived its income from 20 per cent of the
                                ground rents donated by the Kanagawa kencho and from monthly
                                licenses for the sale of liquors. The revenue from these licenses
                                was soon lost, by reason of the refusal of some of the dealers to
                                pay it, and in 1868, it being found that expenses were in excess of
                                income and the Japanese being anxious to resume control, the
                                so-called municipal system came to an end. No taxes other than for
                                liquor licenses and ground rent were ever paid by foreigners here
                                previous to treaty revision. Expenses for street lighting and
                                sprinkling have been met by voluntary contributions.</p>
                            <p>13. At the time of the first allocation of lots of land to foreigners
                                here, Yokohama was a small fishing village, and tenures were
                                governed by local custom. So far as I can learn, these tenures were
                                of a feudal nature. The Japanese Government obtained the lands
                                required from the original holders and became the direct landlord
                                vis à vis the foreigners. At the time of the recent revision of the
                                treaties the classification of native-owned land in Yokohama had
                                assumed in most respects the forms now existing—that is, so far as
                                taxation is concerned.</p>
                            <p>14. Lot No. 4, B, Bund, Yokohama, occupied by the new Yokohama United
                                Club, contains 540 tsubos, and the annual ground rent thereon
                                amounts to yen 151.06. With the new building this property is

                                139.31. The property is capitalized at yen 300,000.</p>

                                Hotel, contain 1,735 tsubos, and the ground rent thereon amounts to
                                yen 485.35. The property is capitalized at yen 250,000.</p>
                            <p>No purchase money whatever was paid for these lands by the original

                                approved by the consuls and upon the payment of a certain amount of
                                ground rent in advance.</p>

                            <p>What is the size of the lot occupied by the consulate-general in
                                Yokohama, and what is the present estimated value? What is the
                                amount of annual ground rent?</p>
                            <p>(Answer.) The lot measures 627 tsubos. The estimated value is 150 yen
                                per tsubo. The annual ground rent is yen 175.40, payable in advance.
                                Value of lot as above, yen 94,050. Ground rent, 0.0018 of value.</p>
                            <p>What is the value of the building occupied by the consulate, and what
                                is the amount of house tax?</p>
                            <p>(Answer.) The estimated value of the building is yen 5,000. The house
                                tax paid for six months amounted to yen 31.89. House tax for six
                                months, 0.006 of value.</p>
                            <p>What is the estimated value of the lots on the Bluff owned by you,
                                and what is the amount of annual ground rent?</p>
                            <p>(Answer.) Lot No. 206 Bluff contains 989 tsubos, and its estimated
                                value is yen 15 per tsubo. Value of lot as above, yen 14,835. Ground
                                rent, at 0.12 per tsubo, yen 118.68, 0.008 of value.</p>
                            <p>What is the value of the buildings on the said lots, and what is the
                                amount of house tax levied thereon?</p>
                            <p>(Answer.) The present value of the buildings is yen 14,000. The house
                                tax amounted to yen 14 for six months. House tax for six months,
                                0.001 of value.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my dispatch No. 417, of the
                            7th of April last, transmitting complaints of Mr. John Lindsley and Rev.
                            Eugene S. Booth, of the executive committee of the American Asiatic
                            Society of Yokohama, respecting leases of land in perpetuity in the
                            foreign settlements not having been confirmed as provided by treaty, and
                            in <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0418"/>respect to buildings thereon
                            being taxed in violation of the true intent and meaning of treaty
                            provisions, I have the honor to transmit herewith a communication and
                            accompanying memorandum<note n="a" xml:id="d307fna">Not printed.</note>
                            from N. W. McIvor, esq., attorney for Messrs. Bower &amp; Martin, giving
                            a case in point involving the same questions, this day received. Having
                            as yet received no instruction upon the general subject which was
                            discussed at length in my No. 417, and the next outgoing mail closing
                            to-day, without attempting to discuss in detail the argument submitted
                            by Mr. McIvor, that the papers in the case may possibly be received at
                            the Department in time for consideration before instruction is prepared
                            in consequence of my dispatch No. 417, I forward them at once with a few
                            observations only.</p>
                        <p>1. In respect to “Form of title and registration,” nothing in the
                            argument set out in the inclosed memorandum, not heretofore presented in
                            the memorandum forwarded with my dispatch No. 417, seems to be
                            presented. The argument, however, is more able and is more forcibly
                            presented. The reference to the position lately assumed by the British
                            Government that the registration of titles as “superficies (perpetual
                            lease)” is not entirely satisfactory (not that it is “not in any sense
                            satisfactory,” as stated in the memorandum) as a substitute for titles
                            held in perpetuity is true and the chargé d’affaires of Great Britain
                            here has now been so instructed and has made such representation to the
                            Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>I may add in this connection that since the position taken by the British
                            Government has become known a larger number of American property holders
                            in Yokohama believe that titles held under leases in perpetuity have not
                            been sufficiently confirmed.</p>
                        <p>2. As to “Separation of houses from lands for purposes of registration
                            and taxation:”</p>
                        <p>On page 9 of the memorandum, paragraph marked “X,” in discussing the
                            Japanese text of the treaties the words “fudosan “and “jisho “are dwelt
                            upon to prove that the Japanese text, more closely than the foreign
                            texts, establishes the conception of the union of the land and its
                            buildings (fixtures). Notwithstanding the logic of the argument in that
                            respect presented, that “there can be therefore no possible doubt as to
                            what is included in its meaning”—to wit, the union of both land and
                            buildings as one immovable, as claimed—is still in question. This point
                            is discussed under summary No. 3 of memorandum of complaints in my
                            dispatch No. 417. The opinion of the two Japanese law commentators
                            therein cited were their interpretation of articles 86, 87, and 242 of
                            the civil code, quoted on pages 12 and 13 of the memorandum herewith,
                            and the question involved turns upon whether their interpretation is the
                            correct one. The two Japanese were interpreting the provisions of those
                            respective articles of the code since its adoption and as it now stands.
                            Mr. Umé, one of the two commentators referred to, was one of the
                            compilers of the code.</p>
                        <p>On page 16 of the memorandum is the statement that “it is admitted that
                            the properties have always been freely sold and recorded, even at the
                            ken-cho, as whole properties (including land and its improvements).”</p>
                        <p>I think that one would draw an erroneous inference from this statement,
                            because until the new treaties went into operation I understand <pb
                                n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0419"/>that the registry was made only
                            at the respective consulates, and in case of registry of titles at the
                            American consulate they were registered in full. Even if recorded at the
                            ken-cho, they were entered as properties in land, giving metes and
                            bounds, making no reference to and taking no cognizance of improvements
                            whatever.</p>
                        <p>In respect to the position taken by Great Britain, as stated in closing
                            paragraph (page 18) of the memoradum, it is true, as I am informed by
                            the British chargé d’affaires, that his Government holds that the
                            buildings on property held under perpetual lease should be considered as
                            included with the land in making transfers, and should not be subject to
                            taxation on registration any more than the land itself. Whether the
                            French Government has yet made an interpretation of its treaty with
                            Japan to the same effect I am not yet advised, though stated in the
                            closing line of the memorandum as having been announced.</p>
                        <p>There seems to be some force in the general argument of Mr. McIvor, he
                            having made as strong a statement in behalf of his client as possible,
                            and if the treaties are to be interpreted in the light of law and custom
                            in the United States, and if, when the treaty was made with Japan, it
                            was understood and intended by the contracting parties that the status
                            of property held under perpetual lease was to remain unchanged in any
                            respect, touching taxation and registration when extraterritorial
                            jurisdiction was given up, it would seem that the contention against
                            separate registration of building and taxes thereon should prevail.</p>
                        <p>That the requirement that transfers of property should be registered as
                            superficies (perpetual lease) is disappointing to some degree, is true,
                            as I have stated in previous dispatches, and in conversation with the
                            minister for foreign affairs on this subject he expresses a desire that
                            some arrangement should be made by which actual ownership of property
                            now held under lease in perpetuity can be effected to the satisfaction
                            of the complaining leaseholders. I anticipate that at the next session
                            of the Diet some law to that effect will be urged to be enacted.</p>

                            foreign affairs, of date the 10th instant, addressed to the British
                            minister <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0420"/>in answer to formal
                            representations made by the British chargé d’affaires ad interim, and
                            furnished me as a reply also to similar representations informally made
                            by me upon the same subject.</p>
                        <p>In view of my interpretation of the above-transcribed paragraph, and in
                            view of the fact that doubt on the part of the property holders whether
                            they should be required to pay the 2½ per cent registration fee on
                            registration of buildings, few if any registrations of buildings were
                            being made; and the time being short in which compliance with the
                            ordinance respecting registration would afford protection to property
                            rights, I was on the point, October 1, of preparing a note to the
                            minister for foreign affairs asking an extension of time for
                            registration beyond December 31 of this year, when, incidentally
                            discussing the subject at the foreign office, I was informed than an
                            extension of six months was to be granted in which to perfect
                            registration. Hence I made no formal request.</p>
                        <p>It now appears from the answer of the minister for foreign affairs that
                            it has been discovered that no right of registration is to be lost and
                            no property right is to be jeopardized in consequence of failure to
                            register property on or before the 31st instant, and that no necessity
                            exists for the extension of the time for registration as provided in
                            ordinance No. 458. The reasoning seems to be somewhat involved and I am
                            not entirely convinced that the conclusion reached is not a questionable
                            one. While the Japanese Government’s own interpretation of their
                            ordinances is supposed to govern, it is difficult in this instance to
                            reconcile the text of the paragraph of ordinance 458 in question with
                            the interpretation given by the minister for foreign affairs, and it
                            remains to be seen whether the Japanese courts will give effect to the
                            views of the Japanese Government as expressed in his excellency’s
                            note.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I am glad to be able to say that I am informed at the
                            foreign office that a bill will be introduced and doubtless passed by
                            the diet very soon to be convened providing for the registration of
                            perpetual leases as such, leaving out the word “superficies,” as now
                            provided for by ordinance No. 458, and thus eliminating any question as
                            to change of form or character of leases in perpetuity by
                            registration.</p>
                        <p>This, I understand, could have been done by ordinance No. 458, and would
                            now be done by ordinance but for the reason that there is no authority
                            to change a law by ordinance. Perpetual leases not being known to the
                            law, the ordinance could only couple the term “superficies “with
                            “perpetual lease,” the latter in brackets, which at the time was
                            supposed to give recognition of such leases and protection of all rights
                            otherwise guaranteed by treaty, but which has not proved satisfactory to
                            leaseholders.</p>
                        <p>I understand that the proposed bill is also to provide for registration
                            of buildings constructed prior to the date of the operation of the new
                            treaties on property held under perpetual leases and not since
                            transferred without payment of the 2½ per cent on value now chargeable
                            under the registration law. This will afford great relief, as heretofore
                            registration of such leases at the consulate made no reference to
                            buildings, since under foreign jurisdiction the buildings were supposed
                            to be included with the land in any transfer without special mention,
                            while by Japanese law they are not so included as a matter of course,
                            and buildings must be registered separately.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of the note No. 52 of October 4 of this year, addressed by
                                Mr. Whitehead, Her Majesty’s chargé d’affaires, to my predecessor,
                                Viscount Aoki, in which he states that the imperial ordinance No.
                                458 of 1899 provides in the first clause of Article I that the
                                transfer of a perpetual lease established in the former foreign
                                settlements may be set up against third persons by having the fact
                                indorsed on the title deed by the chihō-chō, but that the last
                                paragraph of the said article provides that “if a right in an
                                immovable other than that mentioned under paragraph 1, which might
                                be set up against third persons, has been duly acquired by an alien
                                or a foreign juridical person before the time fixed in imperial
                                ordinance No. 251 of the thirty-second year of Meiji (1899), but has
                                not been registered before the said time, it can not be set up
                                against third persons unless it is registered before the 31st of
                                December, 1900.”</p>
                            <p>The British subjects who own perpetual leaseholds in the former
                                foreign settlements, it appears, not only know that Her Majesty’s
                                Government and other treaty powers have objections to the separation
                                of land and houses as regards immovables therein, but as they would
                                have to pay no small registration fee if they registered their
                                houses separately from their lands, they have hitherto hesitated to
                                obtain registration of the immovables owned by them within the
                                settlements. Mr. Whitehead is therefore desirous that the Imperial
                                Government should, if possible, until the question of perpetual
                                leases is settled, extend the limit of time for registration, which
                                is fixed by the above imperial ordinance as the 31st of December of
                                this year.</p>
                            <p>The Imperial Government have given careful consideration to the
                                question of whether or not they ought to extend the limit of time
                                fixed by the above imperial ordinance, as requested by Mr.
                                Whitehead, and they have unavoidably been compelled to come to the
                                conclusion that there is no reason for extending it. I have
                                accordingly the honor to inform you that their reasons are as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p>The rights determined by the last clause of Article I of the said
                                imperial ordinance, which are able to be set up against third
                                persons if registration is effected by the 31st of December of this
                                year, are special rights of priority pledges, mortgages, and leases,
                                etc., established on the perpetual leases, as well as rights of
                                ownership, special rights of priority, pledges, and leases, etc., of
                                buildings such as were acquired by foreigners or foreign juridical
                                persons prior to the date fixed by the imperial ordinance No. 251 of
                                1899—that is to say, the time of the coming into operation of the
                                new treaties— and are limited to such as can be set up against third
                                parties in accordance with the laws governing the act of
                                establishment of the said rights. In other words, rights in
                                immovables acquired by foreigners or foreign juridical persons prior
                                to the coming into operation of the new treaties (with the exception
                                of perpetual lease) which could be set up against third persons
                                without being registered in accordance with the laws governing the
                                act of their acquirement could up to the time of the operation of
                                the treaties be set up against third persons without registration
                                being necessary; yet, as from the time of the coming into operation
                                of the treaties they came under the control of the laws of Japan,
                                they could not, according to article 177 of the civil code, without
                                the special regulations of this imperial ordinance, be set up
                                against third persons unless registered on the day of the coming
                                into operation of the treaties. (Translator’s note: Article 177
                                reads as follows: “Where an immovable is concerned the acquisition
                                or loss or any change in the nature of a right in rem can not be set
                                up against, a third person unless registration has taken place in
                                accordance with the provisions of the law of registration.”) The
                                last clause of Article I referred to therefore extended the limit of
                                time during which the preferential order of rights in immovables
                                duly acquired by foreigners or foreign juridical persons (with the
                                exception of perpetual lease) prior to the operation of the new
                                treaties should follow the order of the act of their establishment
                                and not the order of registration till the 31st of December this
                                year.</p>
                            <p>Such being the meaning of the last clause of Article I of that
                                imperial ordinance, the limit of time for the registration of rights
                                acquired by foreigners prior to the operation of the new treaties is
                                not absolutely determined by the last day of this year, and rights
                                in immovables acquired by foreigners prior to the operation of the
                                new treaties may be registered at any time. But if they are
                                registered in or after January next year the order of the
                                preferential rights in them will follow the order of registration
                                and not the order of the acts establishing them.</p>
                            <p>I am of opinion that, in deciding whether proper reasons exist for
                                again extending the time during which preferential rights could be
                                contended for according to the <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342"
                                    facs="0422"/>order of the act establishing them, and not
                                according to the order of registration, it is necessary to examine
                                the difference or similarity of the protection which they enjoy by a
                                comparison of the rights established prior to the operation of the
                                treaties and the rights subsequently established.</p>
                            <p>It goes without saying that persons who have acquired, subsequent to
                                the operation of the new treaties, rights, such as mortgages
                                established upon perpetual leases within the former foreign
                                settlements, as well as ownership of buildings erected on such
                                properties, and other rights in the buildings, such as mortgages,
                                leases, etc., can not set them up against third persons without
                                registering them. That is, these rights from the first are in order
                                preferential according to the order of registration, and do not
                                follow the order of their establishment; and leaving for the time
                                out of the question the propriety or otherwise of the Imperial
                                Government having applied the term “superficies” to perpetual leases
                                within the foreign settlements, and of the contention of the
                                Imperial Government that the guaranty in the fourth clause of
                                Article XVIII of the Anglo-Japanese treaty simply refers to land on
                                perpetual lease, and does not extend to houses erected thereon,
                                without reference to the propriety or otherwise of these things, the
                                acquirement or loss and change in the nature of rights in rem with
                                regard to immovables after the operation of the treaties, with the
                                exception of the case of the transfer of perpetual leases, can for
                                the first time be set up against third parties by registration; and
                                the Imperial Government has so far neither determined nor seen
                                reason to determine special regulations providing that the order of
                                preference with regard to these rights should follow the order of
                                establishment and not the order of registration.</p>
                            <p>In a word, if we compare the rights in immovables acquired prior to
                                the operation of the new treaties and the rights subsequently
                                acquired, and the different degree of protection they enjoy, we see
                                that the former have the privilege up till the 31st day of December
                                this year of contending for preference in accordance with the order
                                of their establishment, while the latter have not from the first
                                enjoyed this privilege, but have from the date of the establishment
                                of such rights at once obtained order of preference in accordance
                                with the order of registration.</p>
                            <p>If we inquire into the origin of the time specified in the last
                                clause of Article I of the imperial ordinance No. 458 of 1899; that
                                is to say, of the period of grace during which preference can be
                                contended for in accordance with the order of the establishment of
                                the rights, we find in the first article of imperial ordinance No.
                                329 of July 6, 1899, which was amended by that imperial ordinance,
                                “If a right in an immovable which might be set up against third
                                persons has been duly acquired by an alien or a foreign juridical
                                person before the time fixed in imperial ordinance No. 251 of the
                                thirty-second of Meiji (1899), but has not been registered before
                                the said time, it can not be set up against third persons unless it
                                is registered within one year from such time.” However, according to
                                the text of the title deeds by which perpetual leases have been
                                established, in cases of transfer of perpetual leases they can be
                                set up against third persons if the fact has been indorsed on the
                                title deed by the chihōchō having jurisdiction over the place where
                                the land is situated. Imperial ordinance No. 458, therefore omitted
                                from the provisions of the first article quoted above the case of
                                the transfer of a perpetual lease, and so provided that rights other
                                than rights of perpetual lease acquired by foreigners in immovables
                                which had not undergone registration prior to the date of the
                                operation of the new treaties could not, unless registration was
                                effected within a fixed period of grace, be set up against third
                                persons; and it extended such period of grace, which, according to
                                the previous imperial ordinance was one year, altering it to reach
                                to the 31st of December this year.</p>
                            <p>The questions of the propriety or otherwise of the Imperial
                                Government applying the term “superficies” (perpetual lease) to
                                perpetual leases, and of whether or no any conditions other than
                                those written on the title deeds should or should not under the
                                fourth clause of Article XVIII be attached to houses erected on
                                properties held on perpetual lease, have not yet been settled; but I
                                do not consider that there is any reason on this account to extend
                                the time during which rights acquired by foreigners in immovables,
                                with the exception of perpetual leases, prior to the operation of
                                the new treaties, can be claimed in accordance with the order of
                                their establishment. For rights acquired by foreigners in
                                immovables, excepting perpetual leases, after the coming into
                                operation of the treaties have preference in order in accordance
                                with the order of registration, notwithstanding that the above two
                                questions have not yet been settled. That is to say, rights acquired
                                prior to the operation, of the treaties as compared with rights
                                acquired subsequent to the operation of the treaties enjoy special
                                privileges, as a result of the above imperial ordinance, up to
                                December 31 of this year, but they lose these privileges on the 1st
                                of January next year, and thus for the first time occupy an equal
                                position with rights acquired after the operation of <pb n="343"
                                    xml:id="pg_343" facs="0423"/>the treaties; and I therefore see
                                no reason that the nonextension of this time should, as Mr.
                                Whitehead fears in his note of October 4, cause very great
                                inconvenience to British subjects holding perpetual leases, or
                                occasion loss to them.</p>
                            <p>The Imperial Government therefore regret to be unable to consider the
                                question of extension of the above period, in spite of Her Majesty’s
                                chargé d’affaires’ request to that effect. Again, the construction
                                placed upon the last clause of the first paragraph of imperial
                                ordinance No. 458 seems to me, from Mr. Whitehead’s note, to be that
                                when the time mentioned therein has elapsed rights in immovables
                                acquired by foreigners prior to the operation of the treaties can
                                not be registered. But, as I have already had the honor to state,
                                there is no objection to the registration after the 1st of January
                                next year of rights acquired by foreigners in immovables prior to
                                the operation of the treaties. The only thing is simply that
                                preference for rights registered after that date can not be
                                contended for in accordance with the order of their establishment. I
                                have no doubt, therefore, that your excellency will agree with the
                                view of the Imperial Government that there is no reason for
                                extending the time mentioned in the last clause of Article I of the
                                above imperial ordinance.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, there is a matter to which I wish to call your
                                excellency’s attention, namely, that the case of the attempted
                                transfer of a perpetual lease and the buildings erected on the
                                property between Mr. T. R. Brewer and Mr. C. K. M. Martin, cited in
                                Mr. Whitehead’s note, seems to be considered (by Her Majesty’s
                                chargé d’affaires) as a case not within the limits of the
                                application of the last clause of Article I of the imperial
                                ordinance No. 458. I do not know for certain the date of that
                                transaction, but I believe, to judge from the terms of the above
                                note, that it was after the operation of the new treaties. If this
                                is really so, that transaction would not be affected, even if the
                                time fixed in the said imperial ordinance were extended by such
                                extension. That is to say, as I have had the honor to state at
                                length above, the last paragraph of the said first article refers
                                only to rights in immovables acquired by foreigners prior to the
                                operation of the new treaties, with the exception of perpetual
                                leases, and no rights acquired after the operation of the treaties,
                                with the sole exception of cases of the transfer of perpetual
                                leases, can be set up against third persons without registration
                                being effected, notwithstanding the time mentioned in the clause of
                                the article mentioned.</p>

                            parties, especially the limitation in time for the registration of such
                            immovables under ordinance No. 458, I have the honor to inclose herewith
                            a copy of a note to the Japanese minister for foreign affairs upon that
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>The note was written to remind the minister of our interviews in which I
                            had expressed doubt whether, if a case in point should be brought before
                            the courts, they would sustain in their rulings the construction put
                            upon the clause apparently limiting the time to the 31st of December
                            last, as given in his note to the British minister, and to put on record
                            a reservation in my acceptance of the construction he had given the
                            ordinance.</p>
                        <p>While I do not anticipate any case to arise in which, in consequence of
                            fraud, a claim to any building will be set up by a third party, yet
                            possibly one might arise, bringing in question whether owners of
                            buildings not registered before January 1 of this year might not have
                            lost priority of title against some claimant holding a subsequent title
                            through fraud of the original owner.</p>

                                with yourself and my correspondence with your excellency’s
                                predecessor on the subject of the property rights held by citizens
                                of the United States in the former foreign settlements under titles
                                of perpetual lease, as guaranteed by treaty, and particularly in
                                respect to the provisions of that clause of Article I of imperial
                                ordinance No. 458, of December 28, 1899, which stated, “If a right
                                in an immovable other than that mentioned under paragraph 1, which
                                might be set up against third persons, has been duly acquired by an
                                alien or a foreign juridical person before the time fixed in
                                imperial ordinance No. 251, of the thirty-second year of Meiji, but
                                has not been registered before that time, it can not be set up
                                against third persons unless it is registered before the 31st of
                                December, 1900,” I have the honor to state that, by courtesy of my
                                colleague, the minister of Great Britain, I am informed that by a
                                note of your excellency to him—as I have before been informed by
                                your excellency personally—the interpretation put by the Imperial
                                Government upon the paragraph of the ordinance above cited is to <pb
                                    n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0425"/>the effect that the limit
                                of time for the registration of the rights in question is not
                                thereby absolutely determined by the first day of this year, but
                                that the said rights may be registered” at any time, the only
                                question involved being simply that if they are registered on or
                                after January 1 of this year the order of preferential rights in
                                respect thereto will follow the order of registration and not the
                                order of their establishment; and that such being the construction
                                put upon the ordinance by the Imperial Government they have
                                unavoidably been compelled to come to the conclusion that there is
                                no reason for extending the limit of time fixed by the above
                                ordinance for the registration of such rights, and that they are
                                therefore unable to consider the question of such extension.</p>
                            <p>While accepting provisionally the construction put upon the ordinance
                                in question, I nevertheless deem it proper to make reservation in
                                behalf of citizens of the United States respecting the rights
                                involved, should, perchance, at any time a different construction be
                                put upon the said ordinance by a Japanese court of law.</p>

                            settlements that their right, title, and estate in said leases are in
                            effect impaired by reason of Japanese laws requiring— <list>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>It is claimed that both requirements are in contravention of the guaranty
                            of the treaty of November 22, 1894, between the United States and
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>The attitude of the Japanese Government in relation to these questions is
                            set forth in an extract from the note of the Japanese minister to the
                            British minister, contained in Mr. Buck’s letter to Consul-General
                            Gowey, inclosed in his No. 398, of February 5, 1900, to the Department,
                            which is in substance that “the right of perpetual lease, i. e., the
                            right of superficies created for foreigners, is considered a kind of
                            special superficies, and it is clear that it is not the right of
                            superficies according to the civil code;” that even “after the right of
                            perpetual lease has been registered in accordance with the imperial
                            ordinance (No. 329) the title deed has the same validity as before; but
                            that said ordinance was amended by imperial ordinance No. 458, in which
                            the words ‘perpetual lease’ were specially inserted in brackets after
                            the word ‘superficies,’ in order to make it more clear that the
                            so-called right of superficies is the right of perpetual lease. As to
                            the form or mode of confirmation, it is also stated that it is provided
                            in the ordinance that the transfer of a perpetual lease can not be set
                            up against a third party unless the transfer is indorsed upon the title
                            deed; and that such indorsement hitherto made shall have the same effect
                            as an indorsement made in accordance with the above ordinance; that the
                            validity of the title deeds has thus been confirmed.”</p>
                        <p>Forms of title deeds are given in the inclosure in Mr. Buck’s No. 417,
                            one described as in “Foreign settlement, Bluff,” and the other in
                            “Foreign settlement of Yokohama.” They are alike in all essential
                            respects, the former running as follows:</p>

                            regulations made and to be made by the Japanese local authorities and
                            consuls in conjunction.</p>
                        <p>“That nonperformance of said conditions renders the title deed null and
                            void; the lot shall revert to the Japanese Government, and the buildings
                            thereon shall become their property.”</p>
                        <p>The above lease contains no stipulation for any exemption from further
                            charge, and if any existed it was solely in virtue of the law of the
                            extraterritorial jurisdiction, which has been abolished.</p>
                        <p>This view is confirmed by the form of a receipt, stated in Mr. Lindsley’s
                            brief given at the time of the original purchase, that the sum paid “is
                            in full of purchase money of lot.”</p>
                        <p>An inclosure in said dispatch states that the land regulations of
                            Yokohama provide that the proprietorship of the soil being in the
                            Japanese Government no tax will be levied on renters of the foreign
                            quarter for the purposes of streets, roads, jetties, sewers, and drains;
                            that foreign holders are authorized to levy taxes for lighting, street
                            cleaning, and police purposes; that the interest in a lot shall always
                            be held to reside in the owner of record (which is stated in the
                            inclosure to be at the consulate); that no title shall pass unless the
                            deed is lodged for record within three days from the date of the
                            conveyance, but no lot can be transferred within one year after date of
                            title deed.</p>
                        <p>It is to be observed that the taxes thus leviable are in the nature of
                            taxes for municipal purposes.</p>
                        <p>It is also observed that the registration of a transfer within three days
                            from the date thereof is essential to the validity of the
                            conveyance.</p>
                        <p>In the treaty between the United States and Japan, of November 22, 1894,
                            it is provided, in Article II, that citizens or subjects of each of the
                            high contracting parties in any part of the territories of the other
                            “may there own or hire and occupy houses, manufactories, warehouses,
                            shops, and premises which may be necessary for them, and lease land for
                            residential and commercial purposes, conforming themselves to the laws,
                            police and customs regulations of the country like native citizens or
                            subjects.”</p>
                        <p>They “shall enjoy, respectively, the same treatment in matters of
                            commerce and navigation as native citizens or subjects, or citizens or
                            subjects of the most favored nation, without having to pay taxes,
                            imposts, or duties of whatever nature or whatever denomination levied in
                            the name or for the profit of the Government, public functionaries,
                            private individuals, corporations, or establishments of any kind, other
                            or greater than those paid by native citizens or subjects or citizens or
                            subjects of the most favored nation.</p>
                        <p>Article XVIII stipulates that “existing leases in perpetuity upon which
                            property is now held in the said settlements shall be confirmed, and no
                            conditions whatsoever other than those contained in such existing leases
                            shall be imposed in respect of such property.” * * *</p>
                        <p>“All lands which may previously have been granted by the Japanese
                            Government free of rent for the public purposes of the said settlements
                            shall, subject to the right of eminent domain, be permanently reserved
                            free of all taxes and charges for the public purposes for which they
                            were originally set apart.”</p>
                        <p>Imperial ordinance No. 329, of July 7, 1899, provides: “If a right in an
                            immovable which might be set up against third persons has been duly
                            acquired by an alien or a foreign juridical person before the time fixed
                            in the imperial ordinance No. 251 of the thirty-second year of <pb
                                n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0428"/>Meiji, but has not been
                            registered before the said time, it can not be set up against third
                            persons unless it is registered within one year from said time.”</p>
                        <p>This ordinance was amended by imperial ordinance No. 458, December 27,
                            1899, as follows: “When a superficies (perpetual lease) created in a
                            foreign settlement is transferred, such transfer can not be set up
                            against third persons unless it is entered in the title deed by the
                            chihoco of the place where such land is situated. If a right other than
                            that mentioned under paragraph 1 which might be set up against third
                            persons has been duly acquired by an alien or a foreign juridical person
                            before the time fixed in the imperial ordinance No. 251 of the
                            thirty-second year of Meiji, but has not been registered before the said
                            time, it can not be set up against third persons unless it is registered
                            up to the 31st of December, 1900.”</p>
                        <p>It is clear that under the terms of the above lease and treaty the
                            Japanese Government can not alter, impair, or diminish the title and
                            estate in the perpetual lease. And the attitude of the Japanese
                            Government mentioned in Mr. Buck’s said letter to Consul-General Gowey,
                            as well as the amendatory ordinance No. 458, evince that understanding
                            and construction of the treaty by the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>If it be true, as contended, that the superficies is a different and
                            inferior estate to that of the perpetual lease, the registration laws
                            applicable to the former could not apply to the latter. Whether the
                            amendatory ordinance cures the defect of the registration laws depends
                            on its validity and authoritative construction by the Japanese
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>But the Department concurs in the construction given by the Japanese
                            minister, that a perpetual lease may, without, however, altering the
                            title or estate, be styled by a certain analogy a special kind of
                            superficies not defined or provided for by the code, and for this reason
                            and under the express terms of the last paragraph of Article 1 of the
                            amendatory ordinance the failure to register the transfer of perpetual
                            lease within the period therein prescribed could not affect the rights
                            of the transferee by precluding him from setting up said transfer
                            against third persons.</p>
                        <p>The objection of the leaseholders, when analyzed, lies not to a mere law
                            requiring registration of perpetual leases, nor to the mere ideal
                            severance of the estate into lands and buildings for the purposes of
                            registration, but to the effect of the required form of registration on
                            the title to the land.</p>
                        <p>Mere acts or omissions of ministerial officers, unauthorized by law, in
                            omitting essential or adding superfluous words in the recording of the
                            instrument, or by recording the transfers in an improper book, or under
                            an improper description of title, should be subject to redress by the
                            courts in an action of mandamus or for damages. If not, such acts and
                            omissions would appear to be an abuse of power justifying refusal to
                            offer the transfers for registration and the bringing of a test case for
                            an authoritative decision of the question.</p>
                        <p>In the United States the courts lean against that construction of a grant
                            by a State which implies exemption from the ordinary powers and burdens
                            of taxation as belong in the nature of a renunciation of sovereignty.
                            Such exemption must be clearly and expressly given, and is in general
                            strictly construed.</p>
                        <p>This view is reenforced by the consideration that, as is stated, no <pb
                                n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0429"/>buildings were on the lands at
                            the time of the original grants, in consideration of which the ground
                            rents were payable; and by the further consideration that improvements
                            are ordinarily assessed for taxation in the United States on account of
                            the increased value of the land.</p>
                        <p>It does not, therefore, seem clear that under the terms of the said lease
                            and treaty, alien holders of the perpetual leases can object to a law
                            merely requiring their assignees to register and have recorded
                            separately lands and houses; nor to the 2½ per cent tax on houses
                            erected since the coming into operation of the treaties, nor even to
                            such tax on houses before erected.</p>
                        <p>Article II of the treaty puts them in respect of taxes on a footing of
                            equality with the subjects of Japan or with the citizens or subjects of
                            the most-favored nation; unless it can be successfully maintained that
                            the treaty stipulation for the confirmation of the leases, without other
                            conditions than those contained therein, implies <hi rend="italic">ex vi
                                termini</hi> exoneration of land and buildings from all taxes or
                            charges other than the annual payment of the ground rent.</p>
                        <p>The treaty provides for the confirmation of leases in perpetuity without
                            conditions other than those contained in leases then existing.</p>
                        <p>The only condition of the kind named is the payment of the ground rent.
                            It does not prohibit the segregation of the leasehold estates into lands
                            and houses for the mere purpose of registration, so long as the title
                            and estate is not diminished or impaired; and unless the original lease
                            stipulates expressly or by implication a perpetual exemption from
                            registration and taxation other than ground rent, the treaty between the
                            United States and Japan does not seem to forbid it. The Department,
                            however, appreciating the force of the arguments adduced in support of
                            such exemption in virtue of the treaty, reserves its decision for
                            further consideration of this point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Buck’s No. 417 states that the regulations of the several settlements
                            vary in terms, as do also the conditions in the forms of the perpetual
                            lease; that the land regulations for the port of Yokohama provided that
                            foreign holders might levy taxes upon their lands and buildings for
                            police, lighting, and street cleaning, but now, with loss of
                            extraterritorial jurisdiction, they do not have this power, and the
                            question stated by Mr. Buck is relevant, whether the Japanese
                            authorities may not now have the right to tax, at least for these
                            municipal purposes.</p>
                        <p>Article I of ordinance 458 inhibits the transfer of a superficies
                            (perpetual lease) from being set up against third persons unless the
                            transfer has been registered; but as above shown, under the construction
                            by the Japanese minister of the amendatory ordinance, and under the
                            terms of the first paragraph of Article I, and under the express terms
                            of the last paragraph of Article I, there is no period limited for the
                            registration of the transfer.</p>
                        <p>The wisdom of the policy of registration laws is too well settled to
                            admit of question. In the United States they are found in most, if not
                            all, of the States. While no explanation has been made to the Department
                            (except Mr. Buck’s report that there is no law compelling a transferee
                            to register) of the effect as stated in Article I of ordinance 458 of
                            the failure to register transfers, it is presumed that the article is
                            intended to accomplish substantially the same object in this regard as
                            is contemplated by registration laws in the United States. The <pb
                                n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0430"/>ordinance does not profess to
                            invalidate unrecorded transfers, but to prevent their being set up
                            against third persons.</p>
                        <p>But the case of the leaseholders seems to be clearer and stronger under
                            the French treaty. Article 21 of the treaty between France and Japan
                            provides that “leases in perpetuity in virtue of which foreigners
                            actually possess property in settlements shall be confirmed, and
                            properties of this nature shall be subject to no impost taxes, charges,
                            contributions, or conditions whatsoever other than those expressly
                            stipulated in the lease in question.” This stipulation expressly exempts
                            the said properties from all taxes or charges other than the single one
                            of the payment of the ground rents or compliance with any other
                            conditions expressly stipulated in the leases; and if the word
                            “properties” includes buildings on the lands as fixtures, they are
                            equally exempt. The question is, therefore, one of construction of the
                            juridical meaning of the word “properties” as used in the text.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. Lindsley and McIvor, in their briefs, contend “that for the word
                            ‘proprietés’ in the French text, the word ‘fudo-san’ is used in the
                            Japanese text, and that the words ‘terrains’ and ‘jisho’ are
                            correspondingly used, evincing a discriminating legal use of the terms,
                            the former word meaning in the Japanese civil code ‘real estate or
                            immovables,’ in the sense of article 86 of the civil code, ‘land and
                            things fixed to it are immovables;’ while the words ‘terrains’ and
                            ‘jisho’ mean vacant lands.” If their interpretation is correct, the word
                            “properties” would include land and fixtures.</p>
                        <p>It is not stated whether, during the pre code era, the word “fudo-san”
                            was in use and expressed the same legal conception as that attributed to
                            it by the code; but if so, the exemption stipulated in the lease would
                            seem clearly to apply also to the buildings, even if the treaty
                            provisions be interpreted in the sense of the words of the Japanese text
                            and laws.</p>
                        <p>But it may well be contended that the treaty should be construed
                            according to the laws and usages of the country of the holders’ origin;
                            that is to say, according to the law of the extraterritorial
                            jurisdiction in force and there applicable at the time the treaty was
                            formed; that the treaty should be construed according to the laws,
                            usages, and customs in force at the time when and at the place where it
                            was to be carried into execution, under which land and its fixtures
                            constituted a juridical entity; and that it could not be justly
                            interpreted in the light of Japanese laws not then and there in force,
                            the provisions of which, in derogation of existing rights, were not in
                            the contemplation of both high contracting parties. The rights then
                            vested and existing in all their extent could not be presumedly intended
                            to be impaired, and certainly could not be impaired without express
                            treaty provision authorizing it; and especially could it not be done by
                            any doubtful construction.</p>
                        <p>American holders would therefore be entitled to the same exemptions as
                            the French holders, in virtue of the favored-nation clause of the treaty
                            between the United States and Japan.</p>
                        <p>It is impracticable for the Department at present to attempt to give a
                            final construction of the rights of the foreign holders of the leases
                            owing to its unfamiliarity with the laws, usages, and legal terminology
                            of Japan, and to its want of information as to the arguments urged <hi
                                rend="italic">in extenso</hi> by the Japanese Government in support
                            of its contention. But it is hoped that a mutually friendly discussion
                            of the questions <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0431"/>involved may
                            lead to their final and satisfactory elucidation and settlement. The
                            apparently favorable disposition of the Japanese Government is evinced
                            by the statement in Mr. Buck’s No. 526 of December 14, 1900, that a bill
                            will doubtless be passed by the Diet for the registration of perpetual
                            leases as such and for the registration of buildings constructed prior
                            to the coming into operation of the new treaties without payment of the
                            2½ per cent tax. In the meantime you will lend your assistance to the
                            American holders of leases in respect of the freedom of fixtures from
                            other charges than those imposed on the lands to which they are
                            attached, and you will seek, if necessary, a clearer act of confirmation
                            of these titles than appears to have been made.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to confirm your
                            telegraphic instruction<note n="a" xml:id="d315fna">Printed ante.</note>
                            of the 28th ultimo.</p>
                        <p>On the 31st ultimo I handed to the minister for foreign affairs a signed
                            memorandum, copy of which is herewith inclosed, embodying the contents
                            of the above instruction. I also inclose a copy of Mr. Kato’s reply, in
                            which he expresses his preparedness to enter into an examination of the
                            questions indicated when a detailed expression of the views of the
                            Government of the United States shall have been received.</p>
                        <p>Viscount Aoki’s note of January 15 to the British minister (quoted in
                            inclosure with Mr. Buck’s No. 398, of February 5, 1900), and his note to
                            the French minister, dated February 26, 1900 (inclosure with Mr. Buck’s
                            No. 417, of April 17, 1900), seem to contain in effect such an
                            authoritative interpretation. I apprehend that the minister for foreign
                            affairs would willingly give a still more emphatic and unequivocal
                            interpretation, which, whatever might be the future rulings of law
                            courts, would protect leaseholders from damage by making the Government
                            of Japan responsible. However, it is probable that, to end the great
                            dissatisfaction on this score, exact registration of perpetual leases in
                            terms as such and only such will be provided for by law.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the Japanese Government will not concede that buildings
                            which stand on land held under perpetual lease should for that reason be
                            exempted from the house tax or from any other charges to which buildings
                            in general are liable.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to confirm also your telegraphic instruction<note n="a"
                                xml:id="d315fnb">Printed ante.</note> received the 2d instant.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, in a note dated the 5th, copy of which is herewith, I made
                            the above request to the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>In reference to Mr. Buck’s No. 532, no reply has yet been received to his
                            note to Mr. Kato dated January 1, designed to hold the Japanese
                            Government to the foreign office’s interpretation of the last clause of
                            article 1 of ordinance No. 458, which interpretation (in inclosure with
                            Mr. Buck’s No. 526, of December 14) appears to be authoritative.</p>
                        <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0432"/>
                        <p>Shortly before January 1 the British, French, and German ministers sent
                            three practically identical, notes on the same subject, but further
                            strongly protesting against the Japanese Government’s refusal to prolong
                            the time beyond December 31. Day before yesterday they received Mr.
                            Kato’s replies. That to the British minister, which I have read, points
                            out that the clause objected to was inserted as an act of grace, upon
                            the written request of Sir Ernest Satow, for the purpose of allowing
                            ample time for absentees to secure by registration the priority of such
                            rights as subleases, mortgages, etc., already held.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Government are now engaged in preparing for presentation to
                            the present session of the Diet (which terminates on March 24) a bill
                            whose object is said to be to clear up, so far as possible, those points
                            in all matters connected with the immunities and obligations of holders
                            of perpetual leases in the former settlements, which, under the new
                            treaties, are now uncertain or disputed. What the bill will decide—which
                            it will concede by its provisions and which it will refuse by silence—of
                            all the changes asked for by the foreigners is not shown, since the
                            authorities insist that the bill remain secret until actually laid
                            before the Diet.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>Many months ago the French, German, and British representatives, under
                            instructions from their Governments, claimed, as well as immunity from
                            all charges against lands held under perpetual leases, immunity from the
                            house tax and from all other charges against buildings standing on such
                            lands. Their position remains unchanged. They contend that the buildings
                            are “part and parcel of the lands.”</p>
                        <p>The present French position differs from the British and German in that
                            the French minister goes so far as to claim that income tax may not be
                            levied on income derived from property held under the perpetual leases,
                            probably meaning the houses included.</p>
                        <p>In the German position there is a point not dwelt upon by others, based
                            on the fifth paragraph of Article XVIII of the German treaty. It is:
                            That the perpetual leaseholds may now be sold to Japanese without
                            becoming, by the process, titles in fee simple (as well as to any
                            foreigners). If the German treaty secures this right contrary to the
                            conditions of the original leases, then Imperial ordinance No. 333, of
                            July 7, 1899, appears to conflict with that treaty. It seems that this
                            right would widen the market for selling the leases and would prevent
                            the settlement properties from getting irrevocably out of the hands of
                            foreigners, who could not own them in fee simple.</p>
                        <p>The Germans rely upon paragraph 4 of Baron von Marschall’s note of April
                            4, 1896, to secure forever, irrespective of the lapse of their treaty,
                            any rights acquired before or during its operation.</p>
                        <p>Neither the British, French, nor German representative has yet received a
                            definite reply to his representations.</p>
                        <p>An unfortunate misunderstanding, by which it has been widely believed
                            that buildings must always be registered, has been brought about by a
                            mistake in Dr. Loenholm’s translation of the law of registration and by
                            the fact that there are separate registry books for land and for
                            buildings. I have the honor to inclose herewith the translation of
                                law<note n="a" xml:id="d315fnc">Not printed.</note> referred to,
                            with the mistake indicated. From that <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353"
                                facs="0433"/>law—particularly from article 106, for example—it
                            appears that the holder of a perpetual lease to a lot who owns the house
                            thereon is quite safe in the ownership of his house without registering
                            it. I may here add that the Japanese themselves ordinarily do not
                            register their houses if they own the land upon which those houses
                            stand.</p>
                        <p>The best support of the argument that the houses and lands are regarded
                            by the treaties as one is thought to be contained in Article XXI of the
                            French treaty. But as the houses were not in existence when the leases
                            were made, and never belonged to the Japanese Government, it is
                            difficult to understand how they can be considered as properties held
                            under (en vertu de) leases in which the Japanese Government is the
                            lessor.</p>
                        <p>Since under the old system the foreign communities assessed themselves
                            for keeping the streets in order and for lighting, policing, etc., it
                            may be claimed that with the transfer of that duty to the Japanese
                            authorities there goes also a certain right to tax; and since the
                            necessity of such expenditure depends upon the buildings, house taxes
                            may perhaps be regarded to some extent as moneys to meet those
                            expenditures. It is certain that the foreign quarters cost the
                            authorities much more than the Japanese quarters do.</p>
                        <p>It is of interest to note that, even with the present taxable valuation,
                            shrunk by the settlement properties increase in value to only about
                            one-sixth of the actual value, the land tax alone would be much greater
                            than the ground rent. I hope soon to be able to give some statistics on
                            this point.</p>
                        <p>Then, if it should be decided that the land only is referred to in the
                            treaties, it is to be subject to no imposts, etc., further than those
                            expressly stipulated in the leases, i. e., than the annual rent.</p>
                        <p>Under ordinance No. 458 transfers of property held under perpetual leases
                            are registered without charge.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that transfers of such property by bequest are likewise
                            registered free. As the title deeds were granted to those who originally
                            received them, and to their heirs and assigns, this seems to be secured
                            by the terms of the leases.</p>
                        <p>It may possibly be questioned, on the ground that registration is part of
                            the general municipal system under which foreigners have come, whether
                            the registration of mortgages upon and of subleases of property held
                            under perpetual leases should be free. Under the old treaties equitable
                            mortgages were mostly made use of, but ordinary mortgages could be
                            registered at the consulate, the parties thus acquiring a secondary
                            protection in case the original documents could not be produced. As a
                            satisfactory degree of safety was obtained in the old way, although the
                            new way, involving, like all Japanese registration, which is after the
                            Torrens system of Australia, the courts affirming the validity of the
                            right registered, provides the greatest degree of safety, yet the
                            imposition of taxes upon any registrations in which property held under
                            perpetual leases is alone concerned seems to be an additional burden on
                            such property and to be contrary to the treaties.</p>
                        <p>From what I hear I think that the Japanese Government will exempt lands
                            held under perpetual leases from all charges of every kind; but that
                            they will not admit that houses standing upon such lands are for that
                            reason to be exempted from the various charges to which any other houses
                            are liable.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In a note which his excellency the
                                minister of the United States has done me the honor to address tome
                                under date of January 1, 1901, he refers to his correspondence with
                                my predecessor, Viscount Aoki, and the conversation which he
                                subsequently had with me, on the subject of the property rights held
                                by citizens of the United States in the former foreign settlements,
                                and states that he has been informed that according to a note
                                addressed by me to the minister of Great Britain the interpretation
                                put by the Imperial Government upon the provision of the last clause
                                of Article I of the Imperial ordinance No. 458 of the thirty-second
                                year of Meiji (1899) is, as he had already been informed by me
                                personally, to the effect that the limit of time for the
                                registration of rights therein mentioned is not absolutely
                                determined by the aforesaid article, but that the only question
                                involved is that if such rights are registered before such limit of
                                time their order of priority will be in accordance with the order of
                                their establishment, whereas if they are registered after the
                                expiration of the term fixed in that article they rank in accordance
                                with the order of their registration. Mr. Buck provisionally accepts
                                the construction placed upon the ordinance in question by the
                                Imperial Government, but he has nevertheless deemed it proper to
                                make reservation on behalf of citizens of the United States
                                respecting the rights involved, should, perchance, a different
                                construction be put upon the same ordinance by a Japanese court of
                                law.</p>
                            <p>In reply to the above-mentioned note of the minister of the United
                                States, I have the honor to confirm the interpretation of the last
                                clause of Article I of the said ordinance, and to declare that there
                                is nothing to prevent registration being made after the period fixed
                                in that ordinance.</p>
                            <p>The grace in question was solely for the purpose of allowing all
                                rights other than perpetual leases, which had been acquired by
                                foreigners in immovables before the date the revised treaties went
                                into operation, the exceptional privilege of taking the order of
                                priority in accordance with the order of their creation and not of
                                their registration.</p>
                            <p>In regard to the reservation which Mr. Buck makes on behalf of the
                                citizens of the United States respecting the rights involved, having
                                in view the contingency of a construction different from the one
                                declared by me being placed by a Japanese court of law upon the said
                                ordinance, I beg to say that while, on the one hand, I am unable to
                                admit the necessity of Mr. Buck’s reservation, I do not feel, on the
                                other, that I can properly enter upon an examination of the question
                                of the value to be assigned to interpretations placed by the
                                Imperial Government on the laws and ordinances of the Empire.</p>
                            <p>Accept, etc.,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to acknowledge the receipt of
                                your note No. 263, dated the 5th instant, in which you inform me
                                that you have been instructed by telegraph by the honorable the
                                Secretary of State to request the Imperial Government “to further
                                withhold their decision on the questions of property leases, their
                                registration, etc., until the Department, of State can have time to
                                prepare and forward its views.”</p>
                            <p>While it is not clear what kinds of leases are referred to by the
                                words “property leases,” assuming them to refer to perpetual leases
                                of land in the former foreign settlement, I may at once state that
                                when the Imperial ordinances Nos. 329 and 458 of the thirty-second
                                year of Meiji (1899) were promulgated in aid of the treaty
                                stipulations bearing on the subject of such perpetual leases, the
                                Imperial Government were well satisfied that nothing contained in
                                those ordinances were out of harmony with the terms of the revised
                                treaties. This decision having been arrived at at the time those
                                ordinances were promulgated, there is now no decision pending on the
                                part of the Imperial Government, although further consideration of
                                the questions involved may possibly at any time lead to an
                                alteration or modification of the views which have been entertained
                                by the Imperial Government. Nevertheless, I have no hesitation in
                                assuring you that any expression of the views which the Government
                                of the United States may see fit to formulate in reference to those
                                questions will at all times receive that careful consideration which
                                the Imperial Government have always been ready to extend to the
                                representations of your Government.</p>

                            <p>I. <hi rend="italic">What was.</hi>—The Japanese Government set aside
                                and rented to foreigners, for building purposes, certain lots of
                                ground on leases in perpetuity. These lots were leased to bona fide
                                residents only, and the leaseholders were required in some cases,
                                under penalty of forfeiture of their titles, to erect within a fixed
                                period of time buildings of a substantial character.</p>
                            <p>The proprietorship of the soil was expressly reserved to the Japanese
                                Government. The leases specified certain “lots of land,” and the
                                chief condition was the payment of a stipulated annual ground rent,
                                in consideration of which the Japanese authorities engaged to keep
                                the streets, roads, sewers, etc., in good repair without additional
                                charge, the “ground rent” thus being in lieu of the ordinary
                                Japanese land and municipal taxes. Provision was made for further
                                assessments for special purposes, if required, either by the
                                leaseholders themselves or by the authorities with their
                                consent.</p>
                            <p>The rate of annual ground rent varied with different places, and was
                                fixed at times, as in Nagasaki and Yokohama, in terms of Mexican
                                dollars; and elsewhere, as in Hiogo, Osaka, and Tokyo, in terms of
                                the native coin “bu.” The-value of the latter was variously
                                determined, sometimes “weight for weight” with foreign coins, and
                                sometimes by convention (as in the tariff convention of 1866 and the
                                Austro-Hungarian trade regulations). Both these forms of currency
                                fluctuated considerably in value with the rate of silver, but
                                specially the “bu,” which was also subject to deterioration in
                                recoinage. Thus the actual amount of ground rent was variously
                                reckoned in different places, and even in the same locality the rent
                                might be fixed at a different rate at different times, according to
                                the value of the “bu” when the leases were issued.</p>
                            <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0437"/>
                            <p>On the lots so leased foreigners erected buildings for residence and
                                business. “They had absolutely nothing to show for their title to
                                the houses but their deeds to the land,” and this, under consular
                                jurisdiction, was considered a sufficient showing. Transfers of the
                                land generally included the buildings, unless there was a special
                                agreement showing a contrary purpose. Transfers were indorsed on the
                                title deed by the kencho and registered at the respective consulates
                                without any charge other than notarial fees. Such registration was
                                simply notarial and not ex officio.</p>
                            <p>Transfers of title to a Japanese subject had to be sanctioned
                                officially by the consular and Japanese authorities jointly.</p>
                            <p>In case of forfeiture of a lease the lot reverted to the Japanese
                                Government, and in some cases the buildings thereon also became the
                                property of the Japanese Government.</p>
                            <p>Provision was made for the enlargement of the districts occupied by
                                foreigners, when necessary. Such extra settlement properties might
                                be let at a fixed rate, as the Bluff property in Yokohama, or be
                                subject to the ordinary Japanese Imperial and municipal taxes, as in
                                Tokyo, and in Kobe until 1888, or be charged a fixed rental based
                                upon the average of the ordinary Japanese taxes for a few years
                                previous— including also taxes on the buildings—as was the case with
                                the Kobe Hill lots after 1888.</p>

                                of claims of title, as before, but of the titles themselves; and,
                                moreover, under the Japanese law (and practice) of registration, the
                                title to the land carries with it presumptively the title to the

                                the contrary, very much as was formerly the case under consular

                            <p>Viscount Aoki’s notes of January and March, 1900, to the British and
                                French ministers, respectively, give an authoritative assurance that
                                the interpretation of the Japanese Government is that the said
                                leases (in perpetuity) would still have the same validity as before
                                after their registration under ordinance No. 329, and that the words
                                “perpetual lease” inserted in brackets in ordinance No. 458 make it
                                clear that the right is a perpetual lease and not a superficies
                                under the provisions of the civil code. (See article 45 of the law
                                for the operation of the civil code.)</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kato’s notes of December, 1900, and thereafter give an official
                                assurance that the terms of ordinance No. 458 do not cut off the
                                right to register existing rights in realty, other than perpetual
                                leases, after December 31, 1900; that such rights may be registered
                                at any time, only that when registered after the said date they
                                follow the order of their registration and not of their
                                establishment as regards priority of rights.</p>
                            <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Points still requiring attention.</hi>—(1) That
                                titles to settlement properties be confirmed as “perpetual leases”
                                without qualification or change of form.</p>
                            <p>(2) That imperial ordinance No. 458 be amended to harmonize with the
                                interpretation given by the Imperial Government and to avoid a
                                possible difference of interpretation by the Japanese courts.</p>
                            <p>(3) That ordinance No. 333 conform to the terms of the German
                                treaty.</p>
                            <p>(4) That mortgages and subleases of property held on perpetual leases
                                be registered without charge, as their security was satisfactorily
                                guaranteed in the past by their registry or authentication at the
                                consulates.</p>
                            <p>(5) That the value of the “bu” be again fixed by international
                                agreement and the rate of exchange of the Mexican dollar be
                                determined in the same manner.</p>
                            <p>(6) That the meaning of the words “property in the former foreign
                                settlements” as used in the treaties be defined. As a matter of
                                fact, a considerable portion of the property in Japan held by
                                foreigners under perpetual leases lies wholly outside the limits of
                                the foreign settlements, properly so called—e. g., the Bluff lots in
                                Yokohama, the Hill lots in Kobe, and some lots at Nagasaki. Such
                                outlying properties, though in reality constituting what might be
                                called “mixed zones,” have been treated by the local authorities as
                                if within the settlements, but acting under instructions from the
                                central Government and not wholly without question.</p>
                            <p>(It is interesting to note in this connection that the rental of the
                                Hill lots in Kobe, fixed by agreement in 1888, was determined on the
                                basis of the amount of taxes, imperial and municipal, the property
                                would have paid were it owned by Japanese, including taxes upon the
                                buildings erected on the lots, and that it is understood that the
                                Japanese Government has no intention of charging house tax on such
                                buildings.)</p>
                            <p>(7) In one or two places the rent which has regularly been collected
                                and which is now well established by custom is considerably less
                                than that which, according to the terms of the leases, could be
                                claimed for example in Tokyo. It seems desirable that the customary
                                rate in such places be definitely guaranteed for the future.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Department’s instruction No. 338, of February 7 last, on
                            the subject of the settlement properties questions.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor, also, to confirm my telegram of the 26th ultimo.</p>
                        <p>An accurate translation of the law above mentioned is herewith inclosed.
                            Articles I, II, and VII of the law seem effectually to remove all
                            grounds for dissatisfaction as to the confirmation, past or future, of
                            the titles. The law further appears to guarantee to the property freedom
                            from all charges other than the rents, including free registration of
                            transfers, subleases, mortgages, bequests, etc.</p>
                        <p>I am quite sure that the law supposes the property held under the
                            perpetual leases to be the lands only. Article IV is designed, I
                            believe, merely definitely to connect these properties, unique in
                            Japan—that is, lands held under perpetual lease and, secondly, buildings
                            standing upon such lands as well as subsidiary rights in the perpetual
                            leases—with the machinery of registration. There is reason to believe
                            that an imperial ordinance in that sense will very soon be issued. It
                            will probably provide for the registration of transfers of perpetual
                            leases at the kencho, and for that of subordinate rights and of houses,
                            when their registration is desired, at the courts of registry. It will
                            be noticed that there is to be indorsement of transfers upon the title
                            deeds themselves in addition to registration.</p>
                        <p>It has been observed that the application to these properties of the laws
                            relating to ownership makes them liable to be the object of servitudes,
                            such as right of way. Even if this is not a natural consequence of the
                            termination of extraterritorial jurisdiction, it could hardly have any
                            practical importance or be a disadvantage on the whole to the
                            leaseholders in the settlements proper. On the Yokohama Bluff, for
                            instance, where there are also holdings of Japanese, should there be
                            objection, if the question were raised it might possibly be claimed that
                            the bluff was not within the settlements of the treaties. The point
                            seems to me to have no importance.</p>
                        <p>Recent consultation with some of the American holders of perpetual leases
                            in Yokohama, since the passage of this new law, leads me to believe that
                            they are entirely satisfied with the confirmation of their <pb n="360"
                                xml:id="pg_360" facs="0440"/>titles, and that they find the
                            condition of lands is quite free from objection; but that they adhere on
                            the other hand to their belief that buildings should likewise be exempt.
                            I invited any new arguments in support of that belief, and any possible
                            objections to the law in its other two bearings, but nothing has been
                            communicated.</p>

                            imperial ordinance regulating matters relating to rights of perpetual
                            lease was promulgated on the 21st of last month.</p>
                        <p>This ordinance was referred to in dispatch No. 550, of April 1, as likely
                            soon to appear, supplementary to the new law, a translation of which
                            accompanied that dispatch; but the issuance of the ordinance and
                            regulations was delayed by a change of cabinet.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that there is no pronouncement in the ordinance or
                            regulations respecting the tax on buildings erected upon property held
                            under leases in perpetuity; and it is supposed that the Japanese <pb
                                n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0441"/>Government will continue to
                            hold that the matter of such tax is not covered by treaty stipulations,
                            and will continue to adhere to the law and regulations under which that
                            tax is to be levied, notwithstanding the opposition made by Great
                            Britain, Germany, and France.</p>

                            <p>Article 1. When an application for entry in the title deed of a
                                transfer or transmission of a right of perpetual lease or any notice
                                relating to a right of perpetual lease has been received at the
                                local government office within whose jurisdiction the land leased in
                                perpetuity is situated, notice thereof shall be given without delay
                                to the registry office having jurisdiction over the locality in
                                which the land is situated.</p>
                            <p>In giving notice (to the registry office) of a transfer or
                                transmission of a perpetual lease a copy of the title deed shall be
                                sent together with the notice; but when notice to be given relates
                                to a right of perpetual lease in respect of which notice has already
                                been given, it is not necessary that a copy of the title deed should
                                accompany the notice. In this case the designation of the land
                                leased in perpetuity, the names, nationalities, and domicile of the
                                parties concerned, the cause of the transfer or transmission of the
                                right, and its date should be given in the notice.</p>
                            <p>Article 2. For the land leased in perpetuity and the buildings
                                erected thereon special registry books shall be opened and kept at
                                the respective registry offices.</p>
                            <p>Article 3. The registry books shall be of two kinds, one for land
                                leased in perpetuity and the other for buildings erected on land
                                leased in perpetuity.</p>
                            <p>Article 4. Each folio of the registry book for land leased in

                                space, and five sections, marked A, B, C, D, E. The caption space
                                shall contain a designation column and a designation number column.
                                Each of the five sections shall contain a fact column and a rank

                                each piece of land leased in perpetuity has first been registered in
                                the registry book.</p>
                            <p>In the designation column, land leased in perpetuity shall be
                                designated, and alterations of the same shall be entered. In the

                                matter registered in the designation column has been entered.</p>

                                land leased in perpetuity shall be divided into a registry number
                                column, a caption space, and four sections marked A, B, C, D. The
                                caption space shall contain a designation column and a designation
                                number column. Each of the four sections shall contain a fact column

                        <p>According to the information brought to the attention of Japanese
                            minister by Mr. Shimiza, His Imperial Japanese Majesty’s consul at
                            Vancouver, it appears that a party consisting of 13 Japanese subjects,
                                <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0447"/>who started from Victoria
                            on the 15th of March last for Seattle, State of Washington, arriving
                            there on the following day, was refused landing at the latter port, and
                            after having been imprisoned in a jail from the day of arrival until
                            their reembarkation finally ordered to be deported on board the vessel
                            which had carried them thither to the place whence they came. It was not
                            disputed in any way that every one of the Japanese was in good physical
                            condition, holding a health certificate prepared by a licensed physician
                            just before his departure, and being in bona fide possession of the
                            amount of money required by law; and the only ground for the refusal of
                            his landing and subsequent deportation seems to be that he would be
                            unable to support himself. Another group of Japanese subjects of 7 in
                            number who arrived at Seattle from Vancouver on the 17th of the same
                            month met the same fate, receiving exactly similar treatment. The consul
                            adds that upon an examination of the persons concerned, which was
                            conducted at the consulate after their deportation, they were all found
                            well clad, robust, and of sound mind.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing facts, the Japanese minister begs leave to say
                            that these Japanese subjects having possessed the necessary
                            qualifications and fulfilled all conditions requirid by law, he is at a
                            loss to find the reason why they should have been refused landing,
                            inasmuch as no more qualifications or conditions, by virtue of the
                            treaty between the two countries, are to be imposed on the Japanese
                            subjects than those required of other alien citizens or subjects for
                            landing at the United States ports; and even admitting that the Japanese
                            now under consideration were refused to land at the port for the lack of
                            certain qualifications or conditions to meet the requirements of law, he
                            can not perceive any reason for the restriction of personal liberty
                            imposed upon them without due process of law by confining them in a
                            jail, where, according to a statement made by some of them, they were
                            compelled to share company in the same apartment with certain convicts
                            under the sentence of imprisonment.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances the Japanese minister has the honor to request
                            that the honorable the Secretary of State will have the goodness to
                            cause investigations to be made upon the matter to the end that proper
                            measures may be taken should the facts reported be found correct.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to return herewith a
                                communication from the Department of State under date of the 2d
                                instant and a copy of the note verbale of the Japanese minister
                                therein inclosed complaining of the deportation from Seattle of two
                                parties of Japanese immigrants arriving at that place on March 15
                                and 17, respectively, referred to this office for report and return.
                                Replying thereto I beg to state that the examination of these
                                immigrants was conducted in an impartial manner in strict accordance
                                with the immigration laws and regulations. No appeal was taken from
                                the decision of the board of inquiry refusing them admission, and
                                they were fully informed of their right to appeal under the law.</p>
                            <p>In regard to their detention in jail, pending the decision of the
                                board of inquiry, the jail was simply used as a lodging house and no
                                greater restraint was placed on them there than at any other place,
                                as they were certainly not entitled to be at large until landed, and
                                the jail was a more desirable place of detention, in view of the
                                inclemency of the weather at that season of the year, than an
                                exposed steamship dock. They were comfortably housed and cared for,
                                and at no time were they associated or confined with any convicted

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: In regard to the complaint of the
                                Japanese minister concerning confinement of Japanese immigrants in
                                jail at Seattle, beginning March 15 and 17, 1901, I desire to state
                                that there were 24 Japanese immigrants in my custody during the time
                                mentioned.</p>
                            <p>Sixteen of them were kept in the apartment in the county jail where
                                prisoners awaiting trial are held. This apartment is spacious and
                                clean; each cell in it has a closet, two hammocks and blankets for
                                same, and is heated by steam.</p>
                            <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0449"/>
                            <p>The eight other immigrants were kept in the hospital ward or

                                held. This room is large and clean and is supplied with a cot and
                                blankets for each occupant, and has good water and closets.</p>
                            <p>At no time were any of the immigrants associated or confined with any
                                convicted prisoner.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the communication of the honorable Acting Secretary of State
                            dated the 27th ultimo, and of the two inclosures therewith, in reply to
                            my note verbale of the 30th of last April, regarding the deportation of
                            Japanese immigrants from Seattle in March last.</p>
                        <p>I beg that you will tender to the honorable the Secretary of the Treasury
                            my thanks for the steps he has taken to ascertain the facts in the case,
                            as shown by the letter of Mr. Blackwood, deputy collector of customs at
                            Seattle, and that of Mr. Cudihee, sheriff of Kings County, Wash., copies
                            of which were transmitted with the communication under reply. I regret
                            to add, however, that the statements made in those letters do not, in my
                            opinion, completely answer the questions suggested by my note
                            verbale.</p>
                        <p>The points to which I desired to especially draw attention by that note
                            were, first, that a number of Japanese who appeared to be legally
                            entitled to enter the United States had been turned back without
                            apparent cause; and, second, that these persons, while awaiting the
                            decision of their case, had been confined in jail under circumstances,
                            which, to say the least, were not in harmony with the treatment
                            ordinarily accorded to immigrants to the United States. In connection
                            with what Mr. Blackwood and Sheriff Cudihee say on this latter point, I
                            beg to state that His Imperial Majesty’s consul at Vancouver made a
                            careful personal investigation of the matter on the return of the
                            deported immigrants to that place. As a result he reports that while
                            undergoing detention at Seattle some of them were confined in small
                            rooms, 4 together, and the rest in the common room of the jail in
                            company with other prisoners. Some of the latter, the immigrants
                            believed, had been convicted of crimes or offenses. That, however, is
                            not particularly material, since it is not denied that these Japanese
                            subjects, although not accused of any offense, were treated like
                            ordinary criminals and confined with people of that class. In addition
                            they complain that they were supplied with poor and insufficient food,
                            of which, in some cases, they were robbed by the other prisoners. And
                            they assert also that from among the personal effects which they were
                            obliged to surrender on entering the jail, a watch and an overcoat were
                            missing when they were deported. The report of His Imperial Majesty’s
                            consul contains other details similar to the foregoing, but I have no
                            desire to dwell upon this disagreeable feature of the case further than
                            to call it to the attention of the honorable the Secretary of the
                            Treasury, which, I feel assured, is the most certain way of preventing
                            the recurrence of similar treatment of Japanese subjects resorting to
                            this country.</p>
                        <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0450"/>
                        <p>With reference to the first point mentioned in my note verbale (the
                            eligibility of the immigrants), I had the honor to state that according
                            to the information given to me these persons did not belong to any of
                            the classes whose immigration is forbidden by United States law, and
                            that they were healthy, well clad, and in possession of sufficient funds
                            to provide against their becoming public charges. Since, therefore, it
                            appeared that these Japanese subjects possessed the necessary
                            qualifications and fulfilled all the conditions required by law, I added
                            that I was at a loss to discover why they had not been permitted to
                            enter the United States. The plain inference from the admitted facts
                            appeared to me to be that they were entitled to land under the
                            provisions of United States law, and, also, as I stated, by virtue of
                            the stipulations of the treaty between Japan and the United States.</p>
                        <p>I find in Mr. Blackwood’s letter the statement that “the examination of
                            these immigrants was conducted in an impartial manner in strict
                            accordance with the immigration laws and regulations.” Without any
                            intention of questioning the accuracy of this explanation, I would
                            respectfully submit that, as it stands, it does not furnish a complete
                            answer to the statements contained in my note verbale.</p>
                        <p>A reasonable explanation of the failure of the immigrants to appeal from
                            the decision of the board of inquiry, to which Mr. Blackwood further
                            alludes, may be found in the circumstances of their detention already
                            described. If they had appealed they would have been compelled to submit
                            for an indefinite period to the humiliation and discomforts of
                            confinements in jail, and it was only natural that they should have
                            preferred to take the quickest way out of the dilemma.</p>
                        <p>In again calling attention to this case I beg to state that I have no
                            intention of asking for the Japanese subjects immediately interested, or
                            for others who may come to the United States, any special favor or
                            immunity from the operation of the United States laws relating to
                            immigration. All that such Japanese subjects can rightfully expect, and
                            all that the Imperial Government expects on their behalf, is the same
                            treatment as is accorded under similar conditions to the citizens and
                            subjects of other foreign countries. This measure of justice, I feel
                            convinced, it is the purpose of the United States Government to extend
                            to them; and if in the present instance it shall prove, as appears to be
                            the case, that Japanese subjects have been deprived of their right to
                            enter this country by a construction of the law by local immigration
                            officers not justified by the facts, I trust that I may rely upon the
                            good offices of the honorable the Secretary of the Treasury to prevent
                            the repetition of such action.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi> I have the honor to return, with my
                                report thereon, the letter of the Commissioner-General of
                                Immigration and the Japanese minister.</p>
                            <p>I inclose letters from the agents of the S. S. <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Rosalie</hi> and the S. S. <hi rend="italic">Mainlander</hi>
                                which answer the inquiry of the Hon. T. V. Powderly. The letters
                                show that it was not only for the convenience of the steamship
                                companies but for the comfort of the immigrants; besides it was an
                                absolute necessity, in the absence of a suitable secure place for
                                their detention.</p>
                            <p>The immigrants were treated no differently from any citizen of the
                                United States subpoenaed as a witness in a case and unable to give
                                bond for his appearance.</p>
                            <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0452"/>
                            <p>I also inclose letters from Sheriff Cudihee, Attorney Fred H.
                                Petersen, and our interpreter, Charles Sasahe, which explain
                                themselves, and answer, I believe conclusively, the charges of ill
                                treatment and robbery.</p>
                            <p>I will also add my statement that I was present when the secretary of
                                the Japanese consulate at Seattle, the agent of the Oriental Trading
                                Company, and Mr. Petersen conversed with the immigrants at the
                                custom-house, just before they were removed to the Vancouver S. S.
                                    <hi rend="italic">Mainlander</hi>, and at no time did they
                                complain of insufficient food or of being robbed. If they had been
                                so treated they would have reported it to some of the above-named
                                representatives before leaving here, instead of waiting until they
                                returned to the consul, who could do nothing but report the
                                matter.</p>
                            <p>This omission is not only suspicious, but convinces me that their
                                charges are groundless. As these letters may be referred to the
                                Japanese minister, it may be proper to explain the character and
                                standing in the community of Sheriff Cudihee, Attorney Petersen, and
                                Charles Sasahe, and Dr. A. P. Mitten, president of the board of
                                inquiry. Sheriff Cudihee was one of two men elected by an
                                overwhelming majority over the candidate of the dominant party here,
                                so he must be highly respected and reliable and credible. Mr.
                                Petersen’s standing as a gentleman and lawyer has never, to my
                                knowledge, been questioned. Charles Sasahe, a native Japanese, is a
                                successful business man of integrity. Dr. Mitten, besides being
                                deputy collector, was a practicing physician and at one time
                                treasurer of this county; so these gentlemen, being above suspicion,
                                would not misinterpret the case of excluded Japanese immigrants.</p>
                            <p>The other members of this board of inquiry are the customs inspectors
                                who may happen to be detailed for that duty when occasion requires
                                it.</p>
                            <p>As I stated in my letter of April 8, 1901, that as we had no
                                stenographer and as there was no appeal, the oral testimony was not
                                reduced to writing, so I again send the manifests<note n="a"
                                    xml:id="d325fna">Not printed.</note> of the steamship <hi
                                    rend="italic">Rosalie</hi>, March 16, 1901, and the steamship
                                    <hi rend="italic">Mainlander</hi>, March 17, 1901, as all the
                                record of the case under consideration. It will be shown, however,
                                that on each manifest, with one exception, all of the immigrants
                                were farmers, had only about $30, and gave their destination as
                                Seattle.</p>
                            <p>The exception on the <hi rend="italic">Rosalie</hi> manifest was a
                                tailor, and he was admitted, as he could probably support himself at
                                his trade. This was also true of the exception on the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Mainlander</hi> manifest, because he was a coal
                                miner. I mention this to prove that the action of the board was not
                                arbitrary; they only excluded those whom they did not believe could
                                earn a living here. In March many of the Japanese were out of work;
                                the boarding houses were crowded, many having been discharged from
                                the section gangs of the Great Northern Railway, the place where
                                hundreds had been induced to work under contract. The court records
                                will show that the wages of these men are not drawn by themselves,
                                but by contractors who receive a percentage of their wages.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese were the dupes and victims of the steamship runners who
                                prevailed on them to come here under representations of plenty of
                                work at good wages. In the case of the Japanese from Victoria, they
                                had to pay $3.50 to a Japanese named Ohashi for a 25-cent
                                ticket.</p>
                            <p>To prove that the board acted wisely in excluding these Japanese, I
                                will state that the sudden tide of immigrants that was started up
                                without an apparent cause immediately subsided, and the surplus
                                Japanese laborers have been returning to British Columbia for the
                                past three months.</p>
                            <p>If this unnatural influx had not been checked much destitution would
                                have ensued.</p>
                            <p>Under section 5, act of March 5, 1893, I had no alternative but to
                                hold for special inquiry “every person who may not appear to him
                                clearly and beyond doubt entitled to admission,” so my discharge of
                                duty is not “a construction of the law by local immigration officers
                                not justified by facts.”</p>
                            <p>I understand that the Japanese Government has recognized the evil of
                                induced and unrestricted immigration to this coast by limiting the
                                number of passports to be issued in each province. As a result a
                                more intelligent class of immigrants arrive direct from Japan by the
                                Nippon Yusen Kaisha steamships, and, with the exception of
                                stowaways, no Japanese have been deported to Japan in the past eight
                                months. I only mention this to show that no Japanese is excluded
                                without cause, and there is no intention or desire to discriminate
                                against them. Only a very small percentage of Japanese even from
                                British Columbia (where they have no such regulations about
                                passports) are excluded by an impartial, intelligent, disinterested
                                board of inquiry.</p>
                            <p>The deliberations of this board are surely judicial proceedings by
                                sworn officials, and their decisions, in the absence of any appeal,
                                should be presumed to be just and based on sufficient evidence, and
                                to be preferred to the garbled statements of irresponsible, humble,
                                interested persons. I use the word irresponsible advisedly, because
                                    <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0453"/>the immigrants were not
                                free agents, but the dupes and victims of those who purchased their
                                tickets, coached them in the statements they were to make, and
                                probably debtors to the extent of $30 to those who undertook to land
                                them legally and afterwards collect their money and their wages, as
                                has been done in other cases.</p>
                            <p>Owing to the conditions prevailing in Seattle in March, and
                                considering all suspicious circumstances of the two lots of Japanese
                                who failed to secure cards from the United States commissioner of
                                immigration at Victoria and Vancouver, British Columbia, and who did
                                not even buy their own steamship tickets, I think it was merciful of
                                the board of inquiry to return them to the place where they came
                                from at the expense of the steamship companies. Time has
                                demonstrated the wisdom of this course, as hundreds of Japanese have
                                since voluntarily returned to Vancouver.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, I wish to state that at my last official station, Key
                                West, Fla., it is the custom to hold in jail for deportation Cuban
                                contract laborers, even those who hail from an island under the
                                protection of the United States flag.</p>
                            <p>It is explained in my letter of the 8th of April that it was more

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: In regard to complaint about
                                treatment of Japanese in my custody March 17, 1901, I desire to say
                                that the Japanese were not placed with convicted criminals, but were
                                kept in the “hospital ward,” an apartment of the jail given up to
                                boys under commitment to the reform school, inmates of the jail who
                                are sick, and men charged with misdemeanors.</p>
                            <p>As to the food furnished them, it consisted of bread freshly baked
                                every day, mush, potatoes—the best in the market—beef soup, fresh
                                boiled beef, tea and coffee, with sugar, and pork and beans.</p>
                            <p>When these men were brought to the jail they were accompanied by
                                yourself and a Japanese interpreter, and you and the interpreter
                                searched them. The interpreter kept the valuables found upon them,
                                including watches and money. When they were in jail and during all
                                the time they were in my custody, there was never any complaint made
                                by them, or by any of them, or by anyone else, of any missing coat
                                or watch.</p>
                            <p>I believe the steamship company desired to have these people held in
                                custody, as upon presentation of the bill for their board and keep
                                the company cheerfully paid the same.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: As per your request of this date
                                you are hereby informed that in March, 1901, I was employed as
                                attorney by a number of Japanese who had been debarred from landing
                                by the board of special inquiry at Seattle, and pursuant to that
                                employment I called at the custom-house and was present when the
                                Japanese consul’s secretary and the secretary of the Japanese
                                Association were present. We had a consultation with the immigrants
                                and they concluded that they would not go to the expense of
                                employing an attorney, and that they would prefer to return to
                                British Columbia, and that it was not to their interest to appeal
                                their cases, and so stated to me through a Japanese friend of
                                theirs. Thereupon I informed the secretary of the board that it was
                                my clients’ wishes to abandon the appeal, and that no further steps
                                should be taken. The men stated that they would be glad to return on
                                the boat on the next trip to British Columbia, and I have personal
                                knowledge of their returning by such boat. I am further satisfied
                                that these immigrants while at Seattle were properly treated,
                                although there was some objection made in that they had been
                                confined in the county jail, but upon inquiry I learned that there
                                was no place whatever to have cared for them properly except at the
                                jail, and I explained this to my clients and they made no further
                                complaint.</p>
                            <p>I desire to say further that every courtesy was extended to me as
                                their attorney, and to the aforesaid officers of the Japanese
                                consulate and association as well. The immigrants were also treated
                                in a kindly manner, and they were all informed through their
                                interpreter by the officers what their legal rights were, but they
                                unanimously concluded that they would not insist upon landing, but
                                return to British Columbia. The interpreter chosen was a countryman
                                of the immigrants, and he explained to them their rights and the law
                                in my presence and also in the presence of the Japanese officers,
                                and I personally had a conversation with the Japanese consul and his
                                secretary concerning these immigrants. I remember distinctly that
                                the Government officers told the immigrants that if they had
                                presented cards from the commissioner of immigration at the port
                                from which they sailed they would then have had little difficulty,
                                as such a card would have entitled them to enter after passing a
                                medical examination. In view of all that was done concerning these
                                immigrants, I fail to see why any complaint should have been made,
                                as the officers of the Government certainly did not otherwise than
                                their duty, and what annoyance may have been caused to these
                                immigrants could not have been avoided under the circumstances.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge receipt of your
                                dispatch of the 17th day of the 10th month of the 33d year of Meiji,
                                inclosing copies of the memoranda dated respectively the 4th and
                                13th October last, which were exchanged between your legation and
                                the Department of State in regard to the measures of quarantine
                                taken against Japanese subjects by the city of San Francisco and the
                                State of Colorado.</p>
                            <p>The position in which the correspondence now under examination has
                                left the question is not, I regret to say, entirely satisfactory to
                                the Imperial Government, and you are accordingly instructed to again
                                approach the Government of the United States on the subject.</p>
                            <p>The measures which gave rise to the recent discussion established,
                                within the circumscriptions indicated, a clear discrimination
                                against Japanese subjects in the matter of quarantine, and it has in
                                consequence been the contention of the Imperial Government that
                                those measures were not only subversive of the accepted principles
                                of international law and comity by which the equal intercourse
                                between nations is regulated and the rights of aliens are
                                determined, but were at variance with those express provisions of
                                the treaty of 1894 which in reciprocity extended to Japanese
                                subjects in all parts of the territories of the United States both
                                national and most-favored-nation treatment in whatever relates to
                                rights of residence and travel. In this situation the Imperial
                                Government had entertained the hope that the Government of the
                                United States might see their way to take such action against the
                                persons responsible for the enforcement of the measures as could
                                fairly be regarded as an assurance that similar discriminatory
                                regulations would not again be put into operation.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly the announcement, contained in the memorandum of October
                                13, to the effect that for reasons of a purely domestic character,
                                springing from the peculiar relations existing between the Federal
                                and State governments, the United States were unable either to
                                accord redress for the past grievances or to give guaranties against
                                the recurrence of similar grievances in the future, was a source of
                                disappointment to the Imperial Government. If, as is firmly
                                believed, the discriminations in question were actually invasive of
                                rights belonging to the subjects of His Imperial Majesty in virtue
                                of a just application of the principles of the law of nations, it
                                can hardly be said that reference to the distribution of power among
                                the various departments of national authority constitutes a
                                satisfactory answer to the complaint of the Imperial Government,
                                which is based upon an alleged disregard of such international
                                rights.</p>
                            <p>As the Imperial Government in the present case are on the one hand
                                denied the opportunity of seeking adequate redress from the
                                subordinate administrative units which go to make up the supreme
                                Government of the United States, so they are on the other justified
                                in looking to the Federal Government for the fulfillment of the <pb
                                    n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0456"/>sum of the nation’s
                                international duties and obligations. And in advancing as applicable
                                to this question the proposition that in the presence of
                                international rights and duties opposing municipal rules and
                                arrangements are silent, I find myself merely restating a principle
                                of public law which the Government of the United States have, on
                                more than one occasion, as frankly admitted on the one hand as they
                                have strenuously and conclusively maintained on the other.</p>
                            <p>In the Cutting case it was declared by the then Secretary of State,
                                Mr. Bayard, “that a Government can not appeal to its municipal
                                regulations as an answer to demands for the fulfillment of
                                international duties.” A similar rule was laid down by the United
                                States before the Geneva Arbitration Tribunal, and in the Van
                                Bokkelen case, while in the case of McLeod, and in other more recent
                                cases, the Government of the United States have, with a consistency
                                which does equal credit to their sincerity and high sense of
                                justice, acknowledged the supremacy of the same principle.</p>
                            <p>If I have, in citing precedents, limited myself to cases in which the
                                United States were interested, it is not because the doctrine which
                                they illustrate is peculiar to that power, but because the
                                Government of the United States have enunciated the rule with a
                                clearness and precision which leave nothing to be desired.</p>
                            <p>The cases cited, especially those relating to McLeod and Cutting,
                                seem to suggest the manner in which causes of complaint such as
                                those now under discussion may be avoided, and the Imperial
                                Government therefore indulge the confident hope that the Government
                                of the United States, upon further consideration of the question in
                                the light of what has been said, will adopt the necessary
                                legislative measures to effectually safeguard for the future the
                                rights of Japanese subjects who are lawfully within the territorial
                                limits of the United States, and to prevent any repetition of
                                discriminations such as those complained of.</p>
                            <p>In presenting these views to the Government of the United States, you
                                are authorized to deliver to the honorable the Secretary of State a
                                copy of these instructions.</p>

                                    connection with a note of the Japanese legation of the 13th of
                                    June, 1901, with a view to request an early answer to the
                                    instructions therein inclosed.</hi></p>
                            <p>“Defective or erroneous municipal legislation, by which a sovereign
                                claims to be unable to perform his international obligations, is no
                                defense to a demand by another sovereign for redress for a violation
                                of international duty. This position was taken by Great Britain
                                against the United States in the McLeod case; by the United States
                                against France in respect to French spoliations; by the United
                                States against Great Britain in respect to the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Alabama</hi> and other cognate claims; and by the United States
                                against Mexico and other States in denying their right to impose by
                                statute restrictions or disabilities not sustainable in
                                international law on citizens of the United States.” (Wharton’s
                                Digest.)</p>
                            <p>The McLeod case was that of a British subject arrested and held for
                                trial in a State court (New York) for an offense which the British
                                Government avowed was committed in conformity with authority
                                conferred upon the said McLeod by itself. The British Government
                                therefore contended that the case was one which could only be
                                settled directly between the Government of the United States and
                                itself; that consequently the State court had no jurisdiction, and
                                that McLeod should be released.</p>
                            <p>The case resolved itself into one of conflict of authority between
                                Federal and State jurisdiction as regarded an alien. On this head
                                Mr. Webster, in a dispatch to Lord Ashburton dated August 6, 1842,
                                expressed the following opinion:</p>
                            <p>“It is for the Congress of the United States, whose attention has
                                been called to the subject, to say what further provision ought to
                                be made to expedite proceedings in such cases; and, in answer to
                                your lordship’s question toward the close of your note, I have to
                                say that the Government of the United States holds itself not only
                                fully disposed but fully competent to carry into practice every
                                principle which it avows or acknowledges, and to fulfill every duty
                                and obligation which it owes to foreign governments, their subjects,
                                or citizens.”</p>
                            <p>In order to prevent complications like that which had occurred in
                                this case, the Congress subsequently passed a law (Revised Statutes,
                                sections 752, 753, and 754) which gave to Federal courts power to
                                issue writs of habeas corpus whereby such cases could be brought
                                directly within their jurisdiction.</p>
                            <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0457"/>
                            <p>The Cutting case was that of a citizen of the United States arrested,
                                tried, and convicted in Mexico in violation, it was claimed by the
                                United States, of the law of nations. Notwithstanding the fact that
                                die Mexican Government claimed “that the local or State jurisdiction
                                over Cutting’s case did not allow interference by the National
                                Government of Mexico in the matter,” the United States Government
                                persisted in its demand, and Cutting was finally released. It was
                                during the discussion of this case that Secretary Bayard declared
                                that “citizens of the United States when abroad will be protected
                                from discrimination aimed at them on account of their
                                nationality.”</p>
                            <p>It is a well-settled principle in American law and jurisprudence that
                                treaties are a part of the law of the land, and that, as such, they
                                can not by overridden by the laws or enactments of the several
                                States. In the case of McCulloch against the State of Maryland the
                                Supreme Court held that “the States have no power by taxation, or
                                otherwise, to retard, impede, burden, or in any manner control the
                                operation of the constitutional laws enacted by Congress to carry
                                into effect the powers vested in the National Government.” The same
                                principle, as other decisions of the Supreme Court show, has been
                                held to apply to treaties negotiated with foreign powers under the
                                authority vested by the Constitution in the Federal Government.</p>
                            <p>The treatment accorded to Japanese subjects by the quarantine
                                measures adopted at San Francisco and in Colorado was manifestly in
                                violation of this principle. As regarded the San Francisco case, the
                                United States circuit court decided that the measures in question
                                were unconstitutional because manifestly discriminatory against
                                certain classes of the population. In respect to the Colorado case,
                                no result of any kind has been reached except that the governor of
                                that State was invited to give appropriate consideration to the
                                representations of the Japanese legation in this matter. The
                                obnoxious regulations of the State government are no longer in
                                force, but there is no guarantee that similar infractions of the
                                rights of Japanese subjects may not be put into effect there or
                                elsewhere in the United States. If this case is allowed to stand as
                                a precedent, it may easily follow that municipal legislation will
                                have the appearance at least of having been permitted to be
                                paramount, not only to principles announced in the decision of the
                                circuit court above referred to, but also to the specific rights of
                                travel and residence guaranteed to Japanese subjects in accordance
                                with treaty stipulations. It is not believed that this result will
                                be in harmony with the theory or the practice of the United States,
                                either as regards its own citizens abroad or the subjects or
                                citizens of friendly States within its territories.</p>
                            <p>The situation is clearly one which calls for a remedy whereby similar
                                violations of the rights of aliens may be prevented, or, if they
                                occur, may be susceptible of prompt and effective remedy. Such a
                                remedy was afforded in the McLeod case by the passage of an act of
                                Congress. The case under review involves principles sufficiently
                                important to justify the hope that some action of the kind may be
                                taken to protect the rights of Japanese subjects guaranteed both by
                                law and by treaty.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your note of June 13 last in
                            relation to certain quarantine measures of San Francisco and Colorado,
                            and to the explanatory statement in connection therewith which you
                            handed to me on the 14th instant, I observe that, in view of the
                            explanations heretofore furnished by the Department, there remains
                            apparently only one point on which you ask further satisfactory
                            assurances, namely: That some action may be taken to protect Japanese
                            subjects against the recurrence of discriminatory quarantine measures.
                            This assurance I am happy to be able to give you; not, indeed, in the
                            precise form in which it is requested, but in a way which will
                            substantially and effectually accomplish the end in view.</p>
                        <p>It is in the nature of things impossible to prevent by Federal
                            legislation the enactment of improvident and unconstitutional laws by
                            local authorities, whether State or municipal. But it is entirely
                            feasible to afford prompt and complete redress against such regulations
                            whenever <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0458"/>their enforcement is
                            sought to the detriment of personal rights. The individual affected may
                            at once avail himself of the writ of habeas corpus before the Federal
                            courts and obtain his deliverance from any illegal imprisonment,
                            confinement, or restraint. He may also avail himself in such cases of
                            the writ of injunction to prevent the enforcement of such illegal
                            regulations. This was done in this very affair in the case of Wong Wai
                                <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Williamson (103 Fed. Rep., 1); and the act
                            of Congress, which was passed in consequence of the exigencies of the
                            McLeod case, was adopted, not with a view to prevent the passage of
                            illegal local legislation and regulations, but to nullify their effects
                            by empowering the Federal courts, on proper application, to deliver and
                            discharge from the operation of such laws all persons injuriously
                            affected by them, thereby nullifying them for all practical purposes.
                            The remedy thus afforded was and is equally applicable in all cases
                            where quarantine regulations restrain personal liberty (including
                            freedom from interference with the right of personal locomotion or the
                            exercise of any restraint upon the person) in breach of constitutional
                            or treaty rights.</p>
                        <p>The remedies already afforded are, therefore, complete; and since it is
                            physically impossible by any act of legislation to prevent at all times
                            and in all places illegal action of local authorities, the demands of
                            civil justice and of national good faith are reasonably met when ample
                            and speedy remedies for the redress of such grievances or of wrongs of
                            any kind are afforded by the laws.</p>
                        <p>In case, however, of the passage of local regulations alleged to be in
                            violation of a treaty, the Department would, if the same would be
                            brought by you to its attention, cause the matter to be investigated,
                            and if proper would request the Attorney-General to cooperate in taking
                            the necessary legal steps to enforce the due observance of treaty
                            obligations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report the coming to
                            Yokohama of Rear-Admiral Frederick Rodgers with his flagship, the <hi

                            to remark upon the courtesies extended to the admiral and the officers
                            of his ships.</p>
                        <p>Acting under instructions of the Navy Department to represent the United
                            States Navy upon the occasion of the ceremonies attending the unveiling
                            of a monument at Kurihama, erected by the Japanese “American Association
                            of Japan” in commemoration of the advent of Commodore Perry forty-eight
                            years ago, which ceremonies were to take place on the 14th instant,
                            Rear-Admiral Rodgers arrived at Yokohama with his ships on the 7th
                            instant. He with his officers have been most cordially received by the
                            officials of the Japanese Government and by the people, as also by their
                            majesties, the Emperor and the <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0459"
                            />Empress, to whom I have had the honor to present them. The governor of
                            Kanagawa-Ken and the mayor of Yokohama have extended courtesies of
                            entertainments at banquets, as have also the governor and the mayor of
                            Tokyo, the minister of marine and several admirals of the Japanese navy,
                            and more of such entertainments are announced to be given, to all of
                            which the admiral is responding in like manner and spirit.</p>
                        <p>On the morning of the 14th instant the three United States war vessels
                            steamed to the harbor of Kurihama, where there were already live
                            Japanese war vessels.</p>
                        <p>I inclose herewith cuttings from the Japan Times (a Japanese
                            publication), on the 16th and 17th instants, giving a detailed account
                            of the proceedings incident to the unveiling of the monument.</p>
                        <p>The imposing monument of granite is itself a testimony of gratitude for
                            what Commodore Perry did, and the extraordinary and spontaneous welcome
                            accorded Rear-Admiral Rodgers and his officers and ships will doubtless
                            be appreciated by the people of the United States as significant proof
                            of the deep feeling of friendship of the Japanese Government and people
                            for the United States and our people.</p>

                            <p>Imagine a slightly sloping and open sand beach with a frontage of say
                                400 yards. Imagine intermittent showers coming down, now in torrents
                                now in drizzling mist with short intervals of what can only be
                                called a suspicion of sunshine struggling out through the thinner
                                portions of the overhanging clouds. Imagine, excepting a fairly wide
                                pathway in the center ending seaward in an improvised pontoon
                                bridge, the whole frontage consisting of a continuous wall of
                                humanity standing 30 or 40 deep and consisting of all ages and both
                                sexes with the younger ones bathing their feet in the soft rippling
                                sea—this human wall being made picturesque by karakasa and umbrellas
                                of all shapes and shades overhead, and by a full display of the
                                rustic taste for striking and fantastic contrasts in the way of
                                colors in the dresses. Imagine once again thousands upon thousands
                                of wondering eyes all looking anxiously seaward where, a mile or so
                                off, lie three white men-of-war majestically riding at anchor
                                together with our <hi rend="italic">Shikishima, Hatsuse</hi>, and
                                    <hi rend="italic">Amagi</hi> at short distances from each other,
                                while nearer shore torpedo boats and catchers, racing yachts and
                                innumerable other small craft dot the surface, looking smart with
                                flags in full rig. Imagine all this and you have a rough picture of
                                how Kurihama looked for a good part of the morning of the 14th at
                                the particular part where the Perry celebration took place.</p>
                            <p>About 11 o’clock the good ship <hi rend="italic">Hakuai Maru</hi>,
                                with some 300 ladies and gentlemen, Japanese and foreign, from Tokyo
                                and Yokohama, and which had started from the Yokohama pier, hove in
                                sight of the beach. The anchor having been dropped soon after,
                                landing by steam launches and steam-towed junks began. It was
                                raining then, and the proceedings were, to say the least, tedious,
                                even unpleasant. But good humor prevailed everywhere, and nothing
                                failed to provoke merriment, which was indeed the supreme feature of
                                the two hours’ voyage, and which was now prolonged for another hour,
                                during which time the landing was completed. From launches on to the
                                pontoon, then between the staring and wondering crowds, the landing
                                parties came to a big gate of evergreens, which was in the shape of
                                a double cross—one by the side of the other. Inside the gate they
                                were most courteously received by Baron Kaneke, president of the
                                Beiyu Kyokai, and other members of the association, who politely
                                ushered them into the curtain-fenced inclosure. The inclosure must
                                have measured at least 100 by 100 yards or so, and in the center,
                                and somewhat to the rear, rose the object of the day’s celebration,
                                still veiled in a piece of light white cloth. On the right of the
                                monument were-seen Rear-Admiral Rodgers and his fellow-officers, in
                                full uniform, and other American officials, seated under a tent.
                                Similarly to the left were the ministers of state, and high naval
                                and army officers. Then, leaving a good-sized hollow square in the
                                center, rows of tents formed the two sides where <pb n="380"
                                    xml:id="pg_380" facs="0460"/>the guests were variously
                                distributed, the foreigners being all housed in the tents next to
                                that of the American officers; while fronting the monument, and with
                                their backs to the entrance, a naval band took up their post, behind
                                which two companies of marines from our warships formed guards.</p>
                            <p>A few minutes after 12, when the last man had taken his seat, Baron
                                Kaneko appeared in a little improvised green bowered stage at the
                                foot of the monument and announced the commencement of the ceremony.
                                Then walking up to Admiral Rodgers he led that officer to the
                                monument, from the top of which a white rope hung. In the midst of
                                impressive silence the admiral gave a pull at the rope and down came
                                the white veil, and there stood in full view a huge slab of granite
                                with inscriptions in bright gold, cut deep into it and telling in
                                seventeen Chinese characters, chosen and penned by Marquis Ito, what
                                the stupendous rock pillar was for. The unveiling formed a signal
                                for loud and enthusiastic applause which took some time to subside.
                                Hardly had the hand-clapping ended when Baron Kaneko was again on
                                the stage and began to read an address from a scroll of paper. But
                                by this time the news of the unveiling had reached the United States
                                and Japanese warships out in the sea, and they now commenced to fire
                                salutes. While boom! boom! went on the guns, the Baron continued to
                                read his speech, and the scene did not fail to make a most thrilling
                                impression on the vast assembly. We give below a liberal translation
                                of the baron’s address.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">president kaneko’s
                                address</hi>.</p>
                            <p>“Here it was at Kurihama in the district of Miura Kanagawa that on
                                the 14th of July, 1853, Commodore Perry, of the United States of
                                America, by order of his Government, first landed and opened
                                negotiations with the special commissioner of the Shogunate to
                                conclude a treaty of amity and commerce between Japan and the United
                                States. It was at this spot that the modern civilization of our
                                Empire had its beginning. Rear-Admiral Beardslee, who was a
                                midshipman under Commodore Perry, came a second time to Japan last
                                year, and on that occasion he one day revisited this place led by
                                the memories of the past. Subsequently at a meeting of the American
                                Association of Japan he, giving his reminiscences of our country as
                                it was forty-nine years ago, said that he had found the Empire
                                strictly maintaining the policy of stern seclusion and forming by
                                herself a world of her own. But, he continued, his second visit had
                                revealed to him an entirely different country almost able to compete
                                with the great powers of the world in the onward march on the path
                                of civilization.</p>
                            <p>The progress made by Japan during the half century had been so rapid
                                and vast that the admiral could but think that his two visits had
                                been separated by ages. The admiral also remarked that Kurihama was
                                the gate through which Western civilization was introduced into
                                Japan, and that it was his earnest wish that this important spot
                                should have some lasting mark so that it might be remembered by
                                posterity. The members of the association then present were greatly
                                impressed by the narration and at once passed a resolution to erect
                                a monument marking the places of Commodore Perry’s landing at
                                Kurihama. But the association from the very beginning never meant to
                                erect a monument of great cost and grandeur, but on the contrary we
                                decided upon as simple and modest a design as possible to mark for
                                the future one of the most important places in the history of
                                Japanese Empire. Therefore only a small area of ground has been
                                allotted for the purpose. When, however, our intentions became
                                public, the people of the United States at once showed a most keen
                                interest and moreover the Government of that country ordered
                                Rear-Admiral Rodgers, commander in chief of the United States fleet
                                in the East, to attend the unveiling ceremony with three men-of-war.
                                Our most August Emperor having also heard of our undertaking was
                                most graciously pleased to make us a grant in money toward the
                                monument fund, a grant which the association acknowledged as an
                                unexampled honor.</p>
                            <p>“But the construction of a monument of a national event is
                                necessarily a national work, and should not, we thought, be carried
                                out by a private association, but by the whole country. Particularly
                                so, when it was so warmly taken up both at home and abroad. We
                                therefore decided to enlarge the scope of our original design so as
                                to comprise all ranks and classes of the Japanese people. But the
                                time was too short to fully put in practice all the ideas
                                entertained by the association, and besides when we made the change
                                in our programme we found that the stone had already been cut and
                                engraved and did not allow any alteration, so we were compelled to
                                adhere as we have done to our original plan.</p>
                            <p>“To-day is the forty-ninth anniversary of the first landing of
                                Commodore Perry at this place. We have selected the day to unveil
                                the monument. Four decades and <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381"
                                    facs="0461"/>some years ago when Commodore Perry set his foot on
                                this shore, the Japanese Empire was enshrouded in the fogs of a
                                seclusion of nearly three hundred years and all intercourse with
                                foreign countries was strictly forbidden. But since the restoration
                                of 1868, our Government has introduced the laws and customs of
                                Western nations and the nation has undergone a complete and
                                wonderful change, and to-day we behold the Japanese Empire in a
                                prominent position among the civilized powers of the world, the
                                country having concluded treaties on equal footing with the Western
                                powers and having also adopted the constitutional form of
                                government. All these marvelous changes have indeed flowed from the
                                enlightened policy wisely adopted by our most revered Emperor, yet
                                nobody will deny the great obligation we owe to the Government of
                                the United States, which, of all the Western powers, first induced
                                us to open our country to foreign intercourse. Moreover, the United
                                States being the nearest of our Western neighbors, there is reason
                                why our diplomatic and commercial relations with her should always
                                be most amicable.</p>
                            <p>“Rear-Admiral Rodgers is the grandson of Commodore Perry. What a
                                delightful coincidence that the grandfather sowed the seeds of the
                                modern civilization at Kurihama and to-day the grandson unveils the
                                monument built to the memory of his grandfather. This monument is
                                erected to preserve on the stone our determination never to forget
                                the friendship of the United States that sent Commodore Perry to
                                induce us in a peaceful way to have intercourse with foreign powers
                                and also to show to the whole world that our amicable relations with
                                the great powers so happily maintained and all our Western
                                civilization so securely implanted in our soil have had their
                                beginnings at this humble little spot.</p>

                                most friendly to us, and of the ministers of states and of all the
                                ladies and gentlemen present here has given a great luster to the
                                occasion to-day. We only regret that the limits of space and time
                                have prevented us from extending an invitation to all whose presence
                                would have been a great honor to us. Considering that this place is
                                lacking in facilities of communication both by land and sea, that so
                                many should have favored us with their presence must be deemed a
                                very great honor to us. On behalf of the monument committee I have
                                the honor of giving this brief history of the facts and
                                circumstances which led to the building of this monument, and, in
                                conclusion, I hereby beg to express my sincere thanks to all

                            <p>“Had some wise man of prophetic vision, a half century ago, foretold
                                that Commodore Perry’s coming to Japan with his ships, landing at
                                this place and having intercourse with the Japanese Government would
                                be followed by so momentous consequences within fifty years as are
                                now manifest, he would have been treated with derision. Nothing
                                would have been more incredible. And yet, if the Commodore had never
                                approached these shores some other similar incident might have
                                followed with like result. The time was opportune and conditions
                                were favorable for such a departure from the old and the beginning
                                of a new era.</p>

                                little if any contact with the outside world, should have changed
                                its feudal system of government to a constitutional government,
                                entirely by its own initiative and by the grace of a wise Emperor
                                within thirty-five years, is a marvel to the civilized world.</p>

                                made treaties of amity and commerce with the nations of the world;
                                has opened the country to the people of all nations, welcoming them
                                within her borders and throughout the land, granting to them like
                                immunities and protection as given to native subjects. She has now
                                become a world power, accepted in full fellowship into the family of
                                nations on an equality with Western countries.</p>
                            <p>“In such a short period of time to have evolved an army so
                                disciplined and efficient as to command the admiration of the world;
                                to have built a navy of such strength as to force her recognition as
                                one of the great sea powers, speaks volumes for the wonderful
                                enterprise and ability of this the youngest in the family of
                                recognized civilized nations.</p>
                            <p>“One can only understand this when he comes to know the people—their
                                mental activity, their energy, their endurance, their independent
                                and progressive spirit, <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0462"
                                />their ambition, their pride of country, and their loyalty to their
                                Emperor—then one will understand how it is, not only that such an
                                army has been created and disciplined and such a navy built, but
                                also the causes that have brought into existence their
                                constitutional form of government; their modern educational system,
                                so enlarged as to provide for all the youth of the Empire; their
                                modern financial system; their new judicial system; their complete
                                postal and telegraph systems; their extended railway and light-house
                                systems; their hospitals, so well equipped; their Red Cross Society,
                                so well conducted; their extensive textile manufactories and other
                                thousand and one new industries by which they are successfully
                                competing with Western nations in many articles of commerce; their
                                large merchant ships traversing the seas, exchanging products with
                                every country; and the many other evidences to be seen of changed
                                conditions in so short a time, so astonishing to the world.</p>
                            <p>“For her progress in the direction of a new civilization the Empire
                                of Japan has had no precedent. No conquering power has ever overrun
                                this country or devasted its coast cities. No foreign power has
                                attempted to conquer her, or has coerced or in any direction has
                                shaped her course. She does not owe her marvelous progress and
                                prosperity and her constitutional form of government to the control
                                or direct influence of any other country. These grand results have
                                been wrought out by the evolution of a wise people with inspiring
                                impulses and great aspirations, possessed of that intelligent
                                conviction and masterful courage that overcome the greatest
                                difficulties and that insure to a people independence and power.
                                Nowhere in the history of the world can be found a parallel. No one
                                can foretell or set the limit to that degree of advancement the
                                nation is yet destined to reach. The scroll of her future is not yet
                                open to moral vision. Of that one can only judge from what her
                                aspirations and ambition have already accomplished.</p>
                            <p>“As an American citizen I express my profound congratulations that
                                these and other wonderful and beneficent consequences have followed
                                Commodore Perry’s visit, and I am proud of the fact that from that
                                time the most friendly relations have existed between the United
                                States and Japan, and that the ties binding the two countries have
                                been growing stronger the passing years.</p>
                            <p>“Mr. President and gentlemen, this shaft of granite that marks the
                                spot where Perry landed, erected by your people in the honor of his
                                memory, is the strongest evidence, not only of the recognition of
                                the benefits following his coming, but of the friendship existing
                                between your people and mine.</p>
                            <p>“I thank you and your people for this great tribute to the memory of
                                that heroic naval commander, an American citizen, a tribute
                                unprecedented and unaccountable to those not familiar with the
                                character of your people and the spirit which animates them.</p>
                            <p>“Under the beneficent rule of a wise sovereign may your people ever
                                continue in prosperity and happiness, and may everlasting peace and
                                good will exist between the United States and the Empire of
                                Japan.”</p>
                            <p>Colonel Buck’s address over, Prime Minister Viscount Katsura stepped
                                on the stage and read an address, which was in substance as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">the premier’s address</hi>.</p>
                            <p>“On this auspicious occasion, on which the Beiyu Kyokai carry out the
                                ceremony of unveiling the Perry monument, one naturally turns his
                                thoughts to the coming of Commodore Perry, of the United States
                                Navy, four decades and some years ago. Since those days the
                                civilization originally possessed by this country has greatly
                                advanced under the benign influence of Western civilization, and it
                                gives me boundless joy to participate in this grand celebration at
                                this moment when the light of our progress is sending forth its rays
                                with increased brightness. Furthermore, we have to-day with us the
                                United States fleet, dispatched hither for the special purpose of
                                taking part in the celebration. This act of friendship, always
                                characteristic of the American nation, will be most highly
                                appreciated and will never be forgotten by our people, high and
                                low.</p>
                            <p>“Considering it a matter of honor to be present on this felicitous
                                occasion, I have great pleasure in saying these few words of
                                congratulation.”</p>
                            <p>After the premier, Rear-Admiral Rodgers was led to the stage and made
                                the following speech, a report of which we borrow from the Japan
                                Mail:</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">admiral rodgers’ speech</hi>.</p>
                            <p>“As I stand here to-day, honored by this occasion, and representing,
                                together with the officers and men under my command, the Navy of the
                                United States, and appreciating as I do the courtesy and hospitality
                                extended to us by the Imperial Government of Japan, realizing also
                                the sentiments of good will and friendship which <pb n="383"
                                    xml:id="pg_383" facs="0463"/>inspired, under the leadership of
                                Baron Kaneko and his committee, the generous originators of this
                                event, I feel for many reasons that it is for me an especially happy
                                occasion.</p>
                            <p>Looking back for nearly half a century, I remember the departure from
                                home of my grandfather, Commodore Perry, upon his diplomatic mission
                                to Japan. I remember his return, bringing with him the first
                                specimens of Japanese handiwork and art that ever reached the United
                                States, and many of these are still treasured in my family.
                                Naturally, the Perry family has always cherished sentiments of
                                affection for Japan and the Japanese, and I have been impressed with
                                them from childhood. I also remember the honor tendered to Commodore
                                Perry by his fellow-citizens upon his return to the United States,
                                including handsome presents, among others, a magnificent service of
                                silver plate, in recognition of his successful execution of a
                                delicate diplomatic mission. I believe it to be an interesting fact
                                that Japan in 1854 received the first fully accredited ambassador
                                from the United States. Commodore Perry had the honor to be the
                                first diplomatic representative of our country empowered with the
                                functions of an ambassador. The Navy of the United States has always
                                cherished a warm and cordial feeling for Japan and its people. My
                                inclinations have led me to know Japan, perhaps, as well as anyone
                                could who never visited her shores, and no one could be more
                                impressed than I am with the characteristics which have brought
                                Japan with rapid strides to be the peer of the leading military and
                                naval powers of the world. The presence of my friend, Rear-Admiral
                                Beardslee, is a happy incident of this occasion. We all know of his
                                connection with it, and of the interesting fact that he is one of
                                those who landed here nearly half a century ago. May he long be a
                                survivor of that expedition. That the cordial feeling which exists
                                and has always existed between the United States and Japan may
                                continue undisturbed is my earnest hope, and I believe that from no
                                country will Japan receive more hearty good wishes than from that in
                                which Matthew Galbraith Perry was born.”</p>

                                appreciation and thanks for two Japanese vessels having been

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to hand you a statement
                            in regard to the ill treatment of two American missionaries at Taiku,
                            the capital of the province of North Kyung Sang, to which I alluded in
                            my No. 306 of December 14, 1900.<note n="a" xml:id="d335fna">Not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>The facts are briefly as follows:</p>
                        <p>Messrs. Adams and Johnson, American missionaries residing under passport
                            at Taiku, had some trouble over a contract for tiles to cover a house
                            they were preparing for themselves at that place in the name of a
                            Korean. The matter was brought to the attention of the local governor,
                            who is reported as being a man of conservative and rather independent
                            ideas. Upon the order of this governor the Korean writer employed by the
                            Americans, who had written the contract with the tile burner, was
                            arrested, the police forcibly entering the domicile of the Americans to
                            make the arrest. The man was taken before the governor and most
                            inhumanly beaten. When the Americans went to the governor’s yamen to
                            inquire into the case, the governor refused to see them, pronounced
                            their official Korean passports valuelesss and treated them with great
                            indignity, compelling them to stand in the courtyard with the rabble,
                            and refusing to hear their explanations though they were the principal
                            parties to the transaction under discussion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Adams telegraphed me upon December 5 and I sent him immediately a
                            long telegram en claire in which I stated that the governor was at fault
                            and that I would take up the matter with the Korean Government. I saw
                            the foreign minister as soon as possible and obtained from him an order
                            for the release of the Korean writer, Kim, which however did not reach
                            Taiku for some days, owing to a sudden break in the telegraph lines. The
                            governor had in the meantime presumably read while in transmission my
                            telegram to Mr. Adams, for he at once announced that his mother had died
                            and left his post to go into mourning. On December 17 I formally
                            addressed the foreign minister as per inclosure No. 1, detailing the
                            case upon information received from the Rev. Mr. Adams by letter, and
                            contending that the treaty had been violated in four particulars. I saw
                            the foreign minister several times and insisted on his replying to my
                            letter. On <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0468"/>January 25 he
                            replied by quoting from a report of the acting governor, who was one of
                            the chief culprits. This reply was not satisfactory and was almost if
                            not quite discourteous. The principal points in this reply are included
                            in a letter which I prepared on February 1.</p>
                        <p>In 1890 a French priest was very badly treated at this same city of
                            Taiku, his property was stolen and he himself was imprisoned. This
                            incident formed the subject of a dispatch, No. 141, of April 2, 1891,
                            from Mr. Heard, to which Mr. Adee replied in No. 95 of May 19, 1891,
                            instructing him to demand equal rights and privileges for Americans. No
                            such demand has had to be made, as our people have kept “within the
                            letter” of the treaties, but I thought I might well use these
                            instructions in this case. I wrote, therefore, another letter, referred
                            to above as having been prepared upon February 1, replying to the chief
                            points of the letter of the acting governor of Taiku and inclosing a
                            memorandum of the French case of 1890–91. In this communication I
                            informed the foreign minister that I was compelled reluctantly to fall
                            back upon instructions my predecessor had received in connection with
                            the above-cited French case, and that in view of the fact that the
                            action of his Government had rendered practically inoperative the treaty
                            provisions restricting the residence of foreigners to the open ports, I
                            should inform my people that they were at liberty to live anywhere in
                            the interior where foreigners of other nationalities were sojourning. *
                            * *</p>
                        <p>My object in writing this letter was that I might lay the whole matter
                            before His Majesty and have the position of the Americans at Taiku made
                            more comfortable. His Majesty has requested me to consult with him
                            personally before taking any decisive action with the foreign office. I
                            wrote this letter, therefore, with the intention of sending it
                            informally to the Emperor to read before delivering it. I felt certain
                            that His Majesty would not permit it to go officially to the foreign
                            office, a surmise in which I proved to be correct when the translation
                            of the letter was returned me with the request that I retain it for a
                            few days while His Majesty had the foreign minister adjust the matter to
                            my satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>The foreign minister called upon me twice and arranged with me that he
                            should write a careful instruction to the governor of North Kyung Sang
                            Do, who had meantime succeeded the former one, and that he should send
                            me a polite and satisfactory letter on the subject. He offered to punish
                            or dismiss the chief culprit, Noh Chusa, but in discussing the matter he
                            begged that I would allow the new governor to examine first the said
                            Noh. This suggestion met with my approval, as I did not desire the man
                            to be punished without a hearing. I agreed to send the foreign minister
                            an unofficial copy of my withheld letter of February 1, that he might
                            give it to the new governor for his guidance.</p>
                        <p>On February 26 the foreign minister sent me, therefore, a letter, a
                            translation of which I inclose. It proved to be unsatisfactory, as it
                            did not include a copy of the instruction of the foreign minister to the
                            newly appointed governor of North Kyung Sang Province and said nothing
                            in regard to the examination and punishment of Noh Chusa. I had my
                            interpreter return it in person, with a verbal statement as to the
                            omissions, and upon the same day I received a satisfactory reply, a
                            translation of which I inclose, handing me a copy of the foreign
                            minister’s instructions to the governor, a translation of which
                            instructions I inclose also.</p>
                        <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0469"/>
                        <p>I consider this settlement of the case to be satisfactory. The actual
                            money loss was made good finally by the local officials at Taiku. The
                            Americans themselves were not harmed, and for the violation of their
                            treaty rights their presence at Taiku is now officially recognized and
                            sanctioned. I think they will experience no further difficulty.</p>
                        <p>In the discussion of this case I have had to allude to the robbery by
                            highwaymen of the Americans near Taiku, which occurred on October 14
                            last, and which I have referred to in my No. 301, of November 25. This
                            case is also now in process of settlement. I have received one note from
                            the foreign minister upon the subject, and I think he will do all he can
                            to secure justice. I do not consider it necessary to ask for
                            instructions in regard to the matter, and I will report upon it at
                            length when I have brought it to a settlement or if I fail to obtain
                            satisfaction.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform your
                                excellency, that I am now in receipt of a full report in detail from
                                the Americans at Taiku with regard to the violation of their
                                domicile and arrest of their employee by the police under orders of
                                the governor of North Kyung Sang Province, in regard to which I saw
                                your excellency and secured your telegraphic instruction to the
                                governor to release the prisoner and stop proceedings pending a
                                settlement of the case at Seoul.</p>
                            <p>The report I have received is so long that I must content myself with
                                quoting extracts from it, touching only upon the main points.</p>
                            <p>In the first place I am entirely willing to admit that by the
                                provisions of the treaties the permanent residence of Americans in
                                Korea must be at the ports or places opened to trade or within the
                                treaty limits thereof. At the same time, by Article IV, section 6,
                                of the British treaty (which is applicable to the United States as
                                well, by virtue of the “most-favored-nation clause” of the treaty
                                with the United States), it is expressly provided that Americans may
                                freely travel in the interior of Korea on passport, for purposes of
                                pleasure, trade, or the transport and purchase of goods. If my
                                people are thus able to travel and reside temporarily in the
                                interior on passport, they are certainly at liberty to secure food
                                and lodging while so sojourning in the country. I admit also the
                                fact that, without special permission, they are not at liberty to
                                own real estate in the interior, and for that reason, when it has
                                become necessary to secure a dwelling house, owing to the absence of
                                a system of rentals in Korea, my people have always done this in the
                                name of a Korean, so as not to violate the treaty provisions. I have
                                personal knowledge that persons of other nationalities do not put
                                themselves to this inconvenience, but actually acquire such property
                                outright, with the sanction of the local Korean authorities. This
                                being well known to be the case, I can not well forbid my people
                                from following the harmless custom of which the case in point is an
                                illustration.</p>
                            <p>The whole matter of the residence of the Americans in the interior on
                                passport may be discussed separately, if you desire. I have alluded
                                to it here in this place as a preliminary to the following
                                representation in regard to the particular matter under
                                discussion.</p>
                            <p>The facts in this case are that these Americans, Messrs. Adams and
                                Johnson, desiring to stop in Taiku on passport, and not being able
                                to rent suitable quarters, loaned money to a native Korean with
                                which to erect a suitable building for their accommodation.</p>
                            <p>I may mention that at this city there is a regular station of
                                Japanese guards under an officer who remain there permanently in
                                connection with the protection of the Japanese telegraph line. There
                                is also one French establishment there, which has been maintained
                                for some time and seems not to be objected to by the local
                                authorities.</p>
                            <p>There has been no opposition to the presence of the Americans at
                                Taiku; in fact, the people and most of the officials have seemed to
                                welcome them. For some reason they began to experience more or less
                                official interference last spring, which was <pb n="390"
                                    xml:id="pg_390" facs="0470"/>currently rumored to be because the
                                Americans did not make it pecuniarily profitable for the officials
                                to assist them. I have no written proof of this latter, and my
                                statement is based on verbal remarks made to my people, which
                                remarks I personally believe to be true.</p>
                            <p>This autumn the Americans experienced much trouble in buying some
                                tiles with which to cover the house they are about to occupy, and in
                                trying to enforce a contract they had made with a native tile
                                burner, the matter came to the ears of the governor. The tile
                                burner, a man named Soh, seems to have persuaded the governor that
                                he himself was the aggrieved party, and instead of interrogating the
                                foreigners or their servants on the subject the governor on November
                                25 sent his police into the quarters of the Americans and arrested
                                their employee, Kim Tek Yung, who had written the contract for the
                                tiles. The Americans tried to see the governor at once, but he
                                excused himself. They did see the prefect, and showed him the
                                contract and explained the circumstances; that Kim had only written
                                from their dictation, and was in no way responsible for the
                                document; whereupon the prefect discharged the man Kim.</p>
                            <p>On December 1, without any warning or permission, a policeman and a
                                runner from the governor’s yamen forced their way into the innermost
                                quarters occupied by the Americans in search of the man Kim, whom
                                they afterwards found and arrested. The next day he was beaten to
                                compel him to surrender the contract he had written for the tiles.
                                He hadn’t it, and after being beaten till he was all bleeding and
                                exhausted he was thrown into jail.</p>
                            <p>As soon as possible next day the Americans called upon the governor,
                                but were refused admittance. They insisted that they would remain
                                until the governor should see them, whereupon he had them admitted.
                                They offered the governor the contract, for the possession of which
                                he had so inhumanly beaten their employee the day before, but he
                                would not receive it from them. He used them rudely and insultingly
                                and told them that Kim was a Korean and he would do with him as he
                                pleased. He ridiculed their passports when they called the next day
                                and sent them in on his refusing to see them. He sent the documents
                                back, declaring that while Americans usually carry such passports
                                “they are of no value.” He refused to see the Americans. This same
                                day the governor again sent police to the quarters of the
                                Americans-to arrest another employee, but the man was out of town.
                                My people then telegraphed me, and I saw your excellency on the
                                subject.</p>
                            <p>When this case was called for trial, the Americans attempted to be
                                present, as was their right, and also that they might give any
                                evidence that might be required. They were not admitted except upon
                                great importunity and after being kept outside for over half an
                                hour. When admitted, they were compelled to stand down in the
                                courtyard with the coolies and runners. The evidence, without
                                anything from the Americans, was so damaging to Soh, the tile
                                burner, that the governor had him stripped and beaten. Instead,
                                however, of dismissing Kim on finding no evidence against him, he
                                ordered him bound and whipped for “writing the contract for the
                                foreigners.” When Kim was stripped his body was found to be so
                                lacerated and his condition so weak from his beating that even the
                                governor was moved to let him off because—to quote the governor’s
                                language—“because of your pitiable condition.” He was obliged to
                                promise not to repeat the act of which he was accused, namely,
                                assisting foreigners in ordinary business transactions.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency will note that this prisoner was not released upon
                                your order, but before your telegram could reach Taiku. He was
                                released in a most pitiable condition because of the illegal
                                application of torture to him before his trial and in violation of
                                the published laws of your country. No case was proved against him
                                and the other man was found to be at fault. Furthermore, Kim would
                                have been again beaten for serving an American had he been able to
                                stand another beating without dying in the act.</p>
                            <p>After the trial the governor did condescend to see the Americans and
                                listen to their case. The justice of their complaint against the
                                tile burner was so evident that he ordered the man to pay back to
                                the Americans $120 out of $210 remaining in his (Son’s) hands of an
                                advance. He thus showed the justice of the cause of the Americans
                                even if he was unwilling to do them full justice. He also admitted
                                that he had arrested and inhumanly beaten their servant for no cause
                                whatever. The total money loss of the Americans in this case has
                                been $960.</p>
                            <p>But worse than all is the insult and humiliation caused by the
                                governor’s acts in thus violating the solemn treaty provisions. To
                                quote from the letter of the Rev. Mr. Adams: “Words fail me when I
                                think of the humiliation and indignities to which we have been
                                subjected as Americans. To-day I asked another employee to write a
                                business letter for me and he refused, frankly acknowledging that he
                                was afraid to do so.”</p>
                            <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0471"/>
                            <p>Section 1 of Article IX of the British treaty says: “The British
                                (American) authorities and British (American) subjects in Korea
                                shall be allowed to employ Korean subjects as teachers,
                                interpreters, servants, or in any other lawful capacity without any
                                restriction on the part of the Korean authorities.”</p>
                            <p>In beating this servant of a foreigner for doing the latter’s bidding
                                in perfectly legal matters, and in forcing him at what was
                                practically the point of death to promise not to repeat the
                                “offense,” this governor most flagrantly violated the above
                                provision of the treaty upon which these people are here in
                                Korea.</p>
                            <p>By forcibly entering the quarters of the Americans without permission
                                the governor violated section 9 of Article III of the same treaty,
                                which says: “But, without the consent of the proper British
                                (American) consular authority, no Korean officer shall enter the
                                premises of any British (American) subject without his consent.”
                                This term “premises” would apply even to a room in a hotel which an
                                American was for the time in possession of. Not having permission
                                from me, the governor should have asked the consent of the Americans
                                themselves. They would have assisted him in any proper manner. He
                                evidently did not want their consent, and cared not for treaties any
                                more than he did for passports.</p>
                            <p>Section 8 of Article III of the same treaty says:</p>
                            <p>“In all cases, whether civil or criminal, tried either in Korean or
                                British (American) courts in Korea, a properly authorized official
                                of the plaintiff or prosecutor shall be allowed to attend the
                                hearing, and he shall be treated with the courtesy due his position.
                                He shall be allowed, whenever he thinks it necessary, to call,
                                examine and cross-examine witnesses, and to protest against the
                                proceedings or decision.”</p>
                            <p>I was not communicated with and my people were not allowed to be
                                present at the trial, and when they secured an entrance to the
                                courtyard they were treated with gross indignity. When they offered
                                their official passports these were treated with, great disdain and
                                pronounced worthless, though they were but recently obtained from
                                your excellency’s office and bear the great seal of the foreign
                                office of Korea. The provisions of the treaty regarding passports
                                are as follows: Ibid., Article IV, section 6. “British (American)
                                subjects are also authorized to travel in Korea for pleasure or for
                                the purpose of trade, to transport and sell goods of all kinds,
                                except books and other printed matter disapproved of by the Korean
                                Government, and to purchase native produce in all parts of the
                                country under passports which will be issued by their consuls and
                                countersigned or sealed by the Korean local authorities. These
                                passports, if demanded, must be produced for examination in the
                                districts passed through.” A penalty of a fine of $100 is attached
                                to this provision to be inflicted for the violation of the
                                provision. All Americans are provided with passports before going
                                into the interior. Now, a governor of one of the great provinces of
                                the land pronounces them worthless and declines to recognize
                                them.</p>
                            <p>I must respectfully but firmly call your excellency’s attention to
                                the unmistakable fact that this high officer of Korea has treated my
                                people with marked disrespect and insult. He has denied them their
                                treaty rights in the enjoyment of the services of Korean subjects.
                                He has forcibly entered their domicile and arrested their employee
                                without their permission. He has refused to see or hear them when
                                trying a case in which they were the real defendants, and he has
                                violated your own published laws in inflicting inhuman torture upon
                                an innocent man, a servant of the Americans. By this action he has
                                published to the inhabitants that he is unfriendly to Americans and
                                has aroused a spirit that may well lead to serious results if not to
                                the endangering of the lives of my people in that region.</p>
                            <p>What I have related to you comes to me from two witnesses, both of
                                whom are American gentlemen of education and ability, and whose
                                testimony I have perfect faith in. I have not repeated to you the
                                many Korean rumors which have also come to me in this
                                connection.</p>
                            <p>I shall be obliged to refer this matter in detail to my Government,
                                and I must ask for an early reply from your excellency with a
                                statement as to what sort of punishment shall be meted out to this
                                official who has so grossly violated solemn treaty rights, and what
                                steps will be taken to show to the natives of that region that the
                                governor acted without the sanction of the central Government.</p>
                            <p>My Government can not pass lightly over such a breach of treaty
                                provisions, and I trust I may have some satisfactory proposition as
                                to measures to be taken for the satisfaction of this breach that I
                                may report to my Government when sending them the official account
                                of the same.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to
                                acknowledge the receipt of your excellency’s dispatch of January 25,
                                replying to my dispatch of December 17, in which I complained of the
                                treatment accorded certain Americans at Taiku.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency’s letter is chiefly taken up with quoting a reply you
                                have received from the acting govornor of North Kuing Sang, to whom
                                you applied for a report, upon the sudden departure of the governor
                                at the close of the disturbances in question.</p>
                            <p>The acting governor devotes much of his letter to, first, an attempt
                                to prove that the Americans by going to Taiku and furnishing a
                                Korean with the money with which to build them a dwelling, which he
                                falsely calls a church, were violating the treaty; second, he
                                appears to feel hurt by the accusation repeated to my people by
                                Koreans that this trouble was due to the fact that they did not make
                                it pecuniarily profitable for the officials to support them; third,
                                he accuses the Americans of falsehood in their statements as to the
                                violation of their domicile, the insulting manner in which they were
                                left in the courtyard of the yamen with the coolies, and the haughty
                                manner in which the governor refused to receive their passports;
                                fourth, he tries to prove that Kim, the employee of the Americans,
                                was at fault in trying to “force and threaten a poor fellow” in
                                obtaining money from the tile burner; fifth, he dismisses the whole
                                statement of the Americans as “false and without proof.” Your
                                excellency’s letter, omitting the above-cited quotation, is of
                                little importance and is not satisfactory to me. You seem to
                                disregard my dispatch entirely and to base your few explanatory
                                remarks wholly upon the statements of the acting governor, whom I
                                shall attempt shortly to show to be a man whose unsupported word I
                                can not accept.</p>
                            <p>In reply I will mention briefly the chief points brought up in the
                                letter of the acting governor, taking his last point first.</p>
                            <p>I assured your excellency that I had a written account of the matter
                                of which I complained as witnessed by two credible American
                                clergymen. What further proof can I be expected to bring? No Korean
                                would dare risk punishment from his local magistrate by giving
                                testimony against the latter and in favor of the foreigner. As I
                                told you in my former dispatch, I base my representations entirely
                                upon the written statements I have. If you decline to admit the
                                truth of them and accept the challenge of this acting governor, who
                                is one of the culprits to bring proof, then I must take other
                                measures to secure redress.</p>
                            <p>The same holds true as to the third and fourth items. I claim and
                                must insist upon it that my people were insultingly treated; their
                                passports were scorned; they were long refused admission to a trial
                                in which they were the real defendants, and when admitted were
                                treated with great indignity and left standing with the rabble in
                                the courtyard; their quarters were twice forcibly entered by police
                                from the governor’s yamen and their employee was arrested and taken
                                to prison, where he was most inhumanly beaten before any evidence of
                                guilt was found attached to him; when he was found to be innocent he
                                was ordered to be again beaten for serving the Americans, but was
                                excused when it was discovered that further torture would be likely
                                to result in his death; the governor forbade the people to serve or
                                assist the Americans, thus endangering their position and denying
                                them their treaty rights. After all this had been done and my people
                                had opened communication with me, the governor attempted to smooth
                                the matter over and have the Americans accept what they were denied
                                by trial, in the way of money payment, and failing in this he
                                suddenly left his post on the plea that his mother was dead.</p>
                            <p>That this is all true I must insist, upon the strength of the
                                statement of these two Americans. I have also the further evidence
                                of the great anxiety of the governor, who endeavored to induce the
                                Americans to drop the matter, and, failing in that, suddenly made
                                what is considered by Koreans at Taiku an excuse and left the place.
                                I may add in explanation that, failing to find you on the day upon
                                which I was advised of the condition of affairs at Taiku, I sent a
                                long and very strongly worded telegram in plain characters to my
                                people, telling them that the governor’s acts, of which they
                                complained, were in gross violation of treaty rights, and that I
                                should act vigorously in the matter. It was this telegram which
                                caused the governor to release the man Kim and to attempt to smooth
                                over the fact that he had already nearly tortured him to death while
                                awaiting a trial. I know definitely that my telegram produced the
                                release of Kim, because, on account of a break in the telegraph <pb
                                    n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0473"/>line, your telegram to the
                                governor did not reach Taiku until after Kim had been released.</p>
                            <p>As to the second point of the acting governor’s letter, wherein he
                                objects to the suggestion that the use of money might have made
                                matters move more easily, I can not say more upon that without
                                mentioning names, and by so doing making it possible for him to
                                abuse my informants. I will relate, however, a circumstance which
                                may well satisfy the gentleman and prove the truth of his poetic
                                quotation that “When the water goes out the stone will appear.”</p>
                            <p>Some days after the affair at the governor’s yamen to which this
                                correspondence refers, namely, early, in January, a Korean, whose
                                name I shall not divulge, met the nephew of the tile burner Soh, who
                                had been with his uncle during the trial. Finding that Soh was
                                disposing of all his rice fields, this man inquired of the nephew
                                why he was doing so. He was informed that the sale was in order to
                                raise $600 to pay off the debt he had incurred at the trial—with a
                                beating thrown in. When asked why he should pay the officials three
                                times as much as the amount of the original debt, he said he had
                                been induced to do so by the yamen runners, who had assured him he
                                should get off free and without cost. And yet the acting governor
                                complains that the man Kim was “trying to threaten and force this
                                poor fellow!”</p>
                            <p>If your excellency desires any further information upon this subject,
                                I refer you respectfully to the Noh Chusa, of whom I spoke privately
                                to you and who you mentioned in your official dispatch. I can now
                                tell you authoritatively that this Noh Chusa, who appears to be the
                                head Chusa, and who has charge of the investigation of complaints
                                and of the summoning and examination of witnesses, is the official
                                who actually superintended the inhuman beating of Kim, and who
                                afterwards came to the Rev. James E. Adams from the governor (as he
                                said) and passed an hour pleading the governor’s case with the
                                Americans in an attempt to induce them to accept payment and say
                                nothing of the matter. The nephew of Soh is reported as having
                                stated that Noh Chusa “ate $100 of the money.” Your excellency
                                claims that you have no proof against this man. I can only say that
                                as the man seems to be his own examiner and judge further proof will
                                probably continue to be lacking.</p>
                            <p>As to the first and most important part of this strange letter from
                                the acting governor, that relating to the so-called violation of the
                                treaty by the Americans, I may say simply that I have several times
                                suggested to your excellency that it would be wise not to bring this
                                question to an issue, and I am sorry that your present course forces
                                me to declare myself.</p>
                            <p>Knowing the sensitiveness of the Korean Government in regard to this
                                matter, I have never encouraged my people to take up even temporary
                                residence in the interior. I could not forbid them, however, as the
                                treaty expressly provides for travel in the interior, and since you
                                allow others to reside in all parts of Korea, I must see that my
                                people have equal rights with those of other nationalities.</p>
                            <p>To be more explicit, as I informed you personally, your Government
                                had trouble in Taiku in 1890 and 1891 because of a similar outrage
                                committed upon a French priest. As a result of the settlement of
                                this case, made in March, 1891, among six clauses of an agreement
                                arrived at, which the records of your office will fully show, and of
                                which I now inclose a full memorandum, the right to domicile at that
                                place was fully accorded the French subject.</p>
                            <p>My predecessor referred this matter to my Government at the time it
                                occurred, and received explicit instructions, by virtue of the
                                most-favored-nation clause of article 14 of the treaty between the
                                United States and Korea, to demand the same on behalf of our own
                                missionaries whenever the occasion should arise.</p>
                            <p>To recapitulate, the facts are as follows: I have a written statement
                                from two responsible American clergymen of most harsh and
                                unwarranted treatment they have received at the hands of the
                                governor and officials at Taiku, whereby the treaty stipulations
                                were violated in four separate provisions. I wrote the matter fully
                                to your excellency and have seen you personally in regard to it. I
                                made no official demand, but kindly asked you to give me some
                                evidence of a desire to make reparation for the unfortunate
                                occurrence, so that in reporting the incident to my Government I
                                might show that your excellency’s Government had done its full
                                duty.</p>
                            <p>Also upon October 11, 1900, at Mil-Yang, near Taiku, the wife and
                                infant child of one of the gentlemen cited in the present case, Dr.
                                Johnson, together with another American, the Rev. Mr. Sidebotham,
                                who was Mrs. Johnson’s escort, were set upon by robbers, some of
                                whom were dressed in the uniform of Korean soldiers and had guns.
                                These Americans were beaten, robbed, and otherwise grossly
                                maltreated, but escaped with their lives. I saw your excellency in
                                regard to this matter at once, and I wrote you officially upon
                                November 24, and again upon December 15, citing in the latter
                                dispatch a quoted remark of one of the robbers to the effect that
                                they “had robbed no one but the Americans.” I have never been
                                favored with a report <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0474"/>upon
                                this matter, and my two dispatches above cited remain unanswered in
                                spite of the fact that I informed you in my dispatch of December 15
                                that in the absence of satisfactory explanations I should be
                                compelled to hold the central Government responsible for this
                                outrage, since it was perpetrated by what seems to have been Korean
                                soldiers, and since the local authorities appear to have taken no
                                steps of which I can learn to bring the culprits to justice, or to
                                secure the goods which were taken from the Americans to the amount
                                of some 600 yen, while, on the contrary, they seem to condone any
                                mere robbery of an American.</p>
                            <p>I intimated to you privately what you allude to in your dispatch of
                                January 25, that as a basis of settlement I should be satisfied if
                                you would secure the issue of a decree to be published in that
                                region instructing the people to assist and support the Americans,
                                who, I may add, were in more or less distress, as I showed you in my
                                dispatch of December 17, because the governor had so intimidated the
                                natives that they were afraid to render the Americans the services
                                which are allowed them by treaty; this decree to be supported by the
                                punishment of the persons chiefly implicated in the matter
                                complained of, and I particularly named the man Noh Chusa. I also
                                asked that the money losses be made good to my people.</p>
                            <p>Instead of granting my request, I am told that my people have sent me
                                false reports and I am censured for allowing them to go into the
                                interior to live. My propositions for a settlement are entirely
                                ignored.</p>
                            <p>In my letter of December 17 I fully admitted that, according to
                                treaty stipulations, Americans were not allowed to own property in
                                the interior, at the same time taking pains to point out to your
                                excellency the privileges of travel and temporary residence in the
                                interior accorded them by treaty, and I showed you that through a
                                desire to avoid giving offense my people, when they found it
                                necessary in the absence of hotels or any system of rentals to
                                secure a stopping place, were in the habit of doing so in the house
                                of a Korean, an inconvenience to which people of some other
                                nationalities did not put themselves.</p>
                            <p>I now beg to inform your excellency that the provision of the treaty
                                restricting the residence of foreigners to the open ports and
                                immediate vicinity has been practically set aside by your
                                excellency’s Government in the case of the French subject above
                                referred to, as well as in other cases that have come to my
                                knowledge. You have allowed foreigners of other nationalities to
                                reside unmolested for a long time in most of the important interior
                                cities, and as you have forced me to declare myself on this subject
                                by your acceptance of the interested and false statement of the
                                guilty officials at Taiku, in opposition to that of the Americans, I
                                must now inform you that in lieu of a better settlement of this
                                question I am compelled to fall back upon the explicit instructions
                                of my Government and to demand equal rights for my people with those
                                enjoyed by people of other nationalities.</p>
                            <p>In pursuance of this decision I shall inform Americans that they may
                                freely visit and reside in any Korean town wherein any other
                                foreigners may be sojourning, and I shall have to insist that the
                                local authorities grant them full protection.</p>
                            <p>Regretting that your excellency’s failure to treat my complaints with
                                the serious consideration they merit has compelled me to take a
                                position which I have been reluctant to assume, I have, etc.,</p>

                            <p>The following cases are detailed as bearing upon this case, as
                                discussed verbally with the foreign minister:</p>
                            <p>September, 1890, M. Robert, a French priest stopping at Taiku, was
                                forced to seek assistance from the then governor because of riotous
                                Koreans. The governor refused to see or aid him. M. Robert sent in
                                his passport, which the governor tore up, and sent the priest back
                                to his home with a guard, as a prisoner. His house was found to be
                                looted and he had no food or clothes. A final settlement was made in
                                April, 1891, through the mediation of Bishop Mutel, who asked less
                                than the French representative demanded. The terms were as follows: <list>

                                    <item>A dispatch of censure, drafted by Mr. de Plancy, was sent

                            <p>All documents were first submitted to Mr. de Plancy. I believe the
                                money loss was also made good. (See Foreign Office Records, May 10,
                                1894.)</p>
                            <p>The servant of an American and an Englishman at Peng-yang was
                                arrested and beaten. He was released in a few days upon the verbal
                                request of the British and American ministers, and on July 26 the
                                case was settled by the punishment of the “chief offender” and the
                                payment of the money loss, $500. (See Foreign Office Records.)</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: In regard to the matter of
                                Taiku and the treatment by the governor of Messrs. Adams and
                                Johnson, American citizens, I have the honor to say that I have
                                already instructed the officer there to report the entire matter,
                                and I have written you what he reported, but that as the people of a
                                country friendly to Korea were treated discourteously by the former
                                governor, although he did not violate the treaty with intent, but
                                through ignorance, I am not in a position to say that his conduct
                                was proper and courteous toward the foreigners. Therefore I wrote a
                                second instruction, which I inclose herewith, to the officers at
                                Taiku, quoting the clauses of the treaty violated, rebuking them for
                                their wrongdoing, and warning them that they must hereafter in
                                dealing with foreigners avoid a recurrence of such conduct and do
                                what is exactly right and proper toward them. I believe the new
                                governor and the other officials will act accordingly, and that the
                                Americans at Taiku will be undisturbed.</p>
                            <p>As to Noh Chusa, I will have the new governor, when he reaches his
                                post, investigate the case carefully and punish him properly.</p>

                            <p>Since the foreign treaty, article 4, paragraph 6, states that
                                foreigners are authorized to travel in Korea for purposes of trade
                                under passport, therefore any foreigner with a passport may so
                                travel anywhere in the interior.</p>
                            <p>Although foreigners are not allowed to buy land, build houses, or

                                commerce, it is impossible to forbid foreign travelers from residing
                                temporarily in the houses of Koreans.</p>
                            <p>Should natives accused of wrongdoing or summoned as witnesses refuse
                                to obey the instructions of the local authorities, trusting that
                                foreigners will protect them in their disobedience, as Koreans ought
                                not to trust, yet they may not be arrested if they are in hiding in
                                the dwelling of a foreigner.</p>
                            <p>In article 3, paragraph 9, it is stated, viz:</p>
                            <p>“If a Korean subject who is charged with an offence against the laws
                                of his country takes refuge on premises occupied by a foreigner, the
                                consul of the country to which the foreigner belongs, on receiving
                                an application from the Korean authorities, shall take steps to have
                                such person arrested and handed over to the latter for trial. But
                                without the consent of the proper consular authority no Korean
                                officer shall enter the premises of any foreigners without his
                                consent.”</p>
                            <p>The interior is not like a port, and the local authorities are unable
                                to inform a consul of a contemplated arrest, but the owner of a
                                house must be informed before any Korean within a house is
                                arrested.</p>
                            <p>Although an inn in which a foreigner stops while traveling can not be
                                called a <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0476"/>dwelling, yet may
                                not the habitation in which a foreigner stops for some time be
                                designated a dwelling?</p>
                            <p>The arrest of Kim Dok Kun in the dwelling of the American teacher has
                                caused trouble which is due entirely to ignorance of the provisions
                                of the treaty.</p>
                            <p>When foreigners request an audience they must at once be received and
                                treated politely. But are you not insulting and treating them rudely
                                when you leave them standing in the courtyard? In your report you
                                admitted that you permitted them to be present at the trial and
                                afterwards received them in your office, but said nothing in regard
                                to having forced them to stand in the courtyard. By failing to admit
                                this fact, I can see what occurred on the occasion. You did not
                                allow the Americans to attend the trial; you sent police to enter
                                their homes to search for their servant; you did not treat them
                                politely, and you forced them to wait in the courtyard. If this is
                                your method of conducting business (with foreigners) how do you
                                expect to avoid the case becoming a difficult one? In trying a case
                                you must be impartial to both sides and endeavor to be entirely
                                fair. Although in the employ of foreigners, the man arrested was a
                                Korean. Had you treated him exactly as you treat other Koreans this
                                difficulty would not have arisen.</p>
                            <p>In short, you should first have obeyed the provisions of the treaty.
                                As to details of the suitable manner in which to direct the affair I
                                can not counsel you. Foreigners must certainly be politely treated,
                                and cases must be decided fairly and upon the basis of the treaty
                                provisions. If you do this no contention will arise between natives
                                and foreigners. Therefore, I instruct you to act in the manner I
                                indicate and to instruct the magistrates under you to act
                                likewise.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            dispatch No. 318, of the 5th ultimo, reporting the violation of the
                            domicile of Messrs. Adams and Johnson, American missionaries, at Taiku,
                            Korea, by Korean policemen acting under the orders of the governor of
                            North Kyung Sang Do, in order to arrest a Korean writer of the
                            missionaries.</p>
                        <p>The facts of the case as stated in your dispatch and its inclosures are
                            as follows:</p>
                        <p>Messrs. Adams and Johnson desiring to stop temporarily at Taiku, Korea,
                            and not being able to rent suitable quarters, lent money to a Korean
                            with which to erect a building for their accommodation. In buying some
                            tiles to cover the house, and in trying to enforce a contract which they
                            had made (through their native employee) with a Korean tile burner, the
                            matter came to the ears of the governor. The tile burner persuaded the
                            governor that he (the tile burner) was the aggrieved party, and the
                            governor, without interrogating the Americans or their servant on the
                            subject, sent his police, who forcibly entered the domicile of the
                            Americans and arrested their Korean employee, who was taken before the
                            governor and inhumanly beaten. The Americans went to the governor’s
                            yamen to inquire into the case, but the governor refused to see them,
                            pronounced their official Korean passports valueless and treated them
                            with indignity, compelling them to stand in the courtyard with the
                            coolies and runners, and refusing to hear their explanations.</p>
                        <p>The Americans having reported the case to you, you saw the Korean foreign
                            minister and obtained an order for the release of the Korean employee of
                            the Americans. It seems that at the trial of the case <pb n="397"
                                xml:id="pg_397" facs="0477"/>before the governor, the justice of the
                            complaint of the Americans against the tile burner was so evident that
                            the governor ordered him to pay back to them $120 out of $210 of an
                            advance remaining in his hands. The governor also admitted that he had
                            arrested and inhumanly beaten their servant for no cause whatever.</p>
                        <p>In presenting the matter to the foreign minister you contended that there
                            had been violation of treaty in the following particulars: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Article IV, section 6, of the British treaty with Korea (which
                                    by virtue of the most-favored-nation clause of the treaty
                                    between Korea and the United States is applicable to Americans)
                                    expressly provides that British subjects may freely travel in
                                    the interior of Korea on passports, for purposes of pleasure,
                                    trade, or the transport and purchase of goods. You contended
                                    that if Americans are thus able to travel and reside temporarily
                                    in the interior on passports, they are at liberty to secure food
                                    and lodging while so sojourning in the country. You admitted
                                    that they are not at Liberty, without special permission, to own
                                    real estate in the interior, but stated that whenever it became
                                    necessary to secure a dwelling house, owing to the absence of a
                                    system of rentals in Korea, they have secured dwelling houses in
                                    the name of a Korean, so as not to violate the treaty
                                    provisions. You asserted that you had personal knowledge that
                                    persons of other nationalities do not put themselves to this
                                    inconvenience, but actually acquire such property outright, with
                                    the sanction of the local Korean authorities; that this being
                                    well known to be the case, you could not forbid Americans from
                                    following the harmless custom referred to above.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Section 1 of Article IX of the British treaty says: “The
                                    British (American) authorities and British (American) subjects
                                    in Korea shall be allowed to employ Korean subjects as teachers,
                                    interpreters, servants, or in any other lawful capacity, without
                                    any restriction on the part of the Korean authorities.” You
                                    contended that in beating this servant of a foreigner for doing
                                    the latter’s bidding in perfectly legal matters, and in forcing
                                    him, at what was practically the point of death, to promise not
                                    to repeat the “offense,” the governor most flagrantly violated
                                    the above treaty provisions.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>You also contended that by forcibly entering the quarters of
                                    the Americans without permission the governor violated section 9
                                    of Article III of the same treaty, which says: “But without the
                                    consent of the proper British (American) consular authority, no
                                    Korean officer shall enter the premises of any British
                                    (American) subject without his consent.”</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Section 8 of Article III of the same treaty says: “In all
                                    cases, whether civil or criminal, tried either in Korean or
                                    British (American) courts in Korea, a properly authorized
                                    official of the plaintiff or prosecutor shall be allowed to
                                    attend the hearing, and he shall be treated with the courtesy
                                    due his position. He shall be allowed, whenever he thinks it
                                    necessary, to call, examine, and cross-examine witnesses, and to
                                    protest against the proceedings or decision.” You stated that
                                    you were not communicated with, nor were the Americans allowed
                                    to be present at the trial, and when they secured an entrance to
                                    the courtyard they were treated with gross indignity.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>You presented the matter in writing to the Korean foreign minister, and
                            asked for an early reply, “with a statement as to what sort of
                            punishment shall be meted out to this official who has grossly violated
                            solemn treaty rights, and what steps will be taken to show to the <pb
                                n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0478"/>natives of that region that the
                            governor acted without the sanction of the Central Government.”</p>
                        <p>The foreign minister replied, stating that the Americans were not treated
                            courteously and that the former governor had violated the treaty through
                            ignorance, and not with intent; that he (the foreign minister) had
                            instructed the officials at Taiku, quoting the clauses of the treaty
                            violated, rebuking them for their wrongdoing and warning them that they
                            must thereafter, in dealing with foreigners, avoid a recurrence of such
                            conduct and do what is exactly right and proper toward them.</p>
                        <p>This being unsatisfactory to you, as it did not include a copy of the
                            instruction of the foreign minister, and said nothing in regard to the
                            examination and punishment of the guilty official, you accordingly
                            returned the communication of the foreign minister with a verbal
                            statement as to these omissions, and upon the same day you received a
                            satisfactory reply, together with a copy of the foreign minister’s
                            instructions to the governor. This reply of the foreign minister yields
                            fully all the points made by you.</p>
                        <p>You conclude your dispatch with the statement that the actual money loss
                            to the Americans was made good by the local officials; that the
                            Americans themselves were not harmed, and that for the violation of
                            their treaty rights their presence in Taiku is now officially recognized
                            and sanctioned, and that you think they will experience no further
                            difficulty.</p>
                        <p>I may say, in passing, that the British treaty does not appear to allow
                            missionaries to travel or reside in the interior of Korea (for the
                            purpose of preaching or teaching), but Minister Heard, in his dispatch
                            No. 141, of April 2, 1891, in the Robert case; states that the French
                            treaty with Korea omits the words (contained in the English treaty) “for
                            purposes of pleasure, trade,” etc., and he asserts that this was done
                            with a view of covering the action of their missionaries. This view was
                            acquiesced in by Korea in the Robert case.</p>
                        <p>The Department approves your treatment of the case, which is
                            characterized by firmness and good sense.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Replying to your dispatch No. 166, of
                            April 18, the receipt of which on June 1 I have already acknowledged, in
                            which I note with satisfaction that my conduct in regard to the matter
                            of the violation of the domicile of Americans at Taiku met with the
                            approval of the Department, I now have the honor to acquaint you with
                            the sequel to that action.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, on May 8 I received a complaint from the Korean
                            foreign office that two Americans, Reverend Whittemore and Dr.
                            Sharrocks, were erecting houses at Sun Chun, in North Pengyang Province,
                            near the northwestern border of Korea. (See inclosure 1.) I at once
                            called upon these missionaries for a report on the subject, and received
                            a reply on May 26 stating that the property in question was held in the
                            name of certain Koreans, and that the presence of the <pb n="399"
                                xml:id="pg_399" facs="0479"/>Americans had not been objected to.
                            (See inclosure 2.) On receipt of this report I addressed the minister
                            for foreign affairs, as per inclosure 3, taking much the same ground
                            that I had taken in regard to the Taiku matter.</p>
                        <p>On May 28 I received a long personal note from Rev. James E. Adams, of
                            Taiku, informing me that the governor of North Kyung-sang Province
                            disclaimed all knowledge of the instructions which the minister for
                            foreign affairs had informed me he had issued to him, a copy of which
                            instructions I forwarded to you in my No. 318 of March 5, to which your
                            No. 166 is a reply. The governor further declared to Mr. Adams that he
                            had never heard of the matter at all until mentioned by Mr. Adams. He
                            had also had the helper of the Americans rearrested, this time upon an
                            ancient charge against the man’s uncle of having misappropriated public
                            moneys. The governor frankly said he would “probably kill him.” This
                            helper is the same one whose arrest and inhuman beating caused the
                            previous correspondence in regard to the residence of Americans at
                            Taiku.</p>
                        <p>I therefore addressed the minister for foreign affairs on May 29, as per
                            inclosed copy (inclosure 4), citing the circumstances and leaving it for
                            him to determine where lay the fault for the miscarriage of
                            instructions. I also took the opportunity to forward as an inclosure my
                            withheld dispatch of February 1, a copy of which I sent you with my No.
                            318 of March 5. I said to him that I would not entertain further
                            complaints of the mere residence of Americans in the interior on
                            passport such as that to which my inclosure No. 4 is a reply.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>When calling upon me on the 3d instant the foreign minister seemed
                            greatly chagrined over this matter, of which he had little to say except
                            that he had issued the instructions and was now reissuing them in
                            stronger form.</p>
                        <p>It may be difficult for the Department to understand how such a
                            miscarriage could occur. The conditions, however, are much the same as
                            those that exist in China. The country officials purchase their offices
                            at a heavy cost in money paid in advance. They have not a very firm
                            tenure of office and must make good their outlay as soon as possible,
                            and at the same time they must secure the regular governmental taxes
                            besides a handsome profit for themselves. They care little for
                            instructions from Seoul unless such instructions come from the palace
                            and indicate that a noncompliance may result in the loss of position.
                            This governor, who is a favorite of the Emperor, doubtless counted upon
                            his court influence to carry him through, and seeing a good opportunity
                            to make money from harrying the industrious native Christians, saw fit
                            to disclaim any knowledge of the instructions. * * *</p>
                        <p>My new representations may do some good, but at least the question of the
                            residence of Americans at Taiku is favorably settled by the Central
                            Government, which is perhaps all that could be asked. Each difficulty
                            will have to be treated as it arises.</p>
                        <p>In your No. 166, to which this is a reply, you refer to the fact that the
                            French treaty is more liberal in regard to missionaries than is the
                            British treaty which I quoted. I did not care to bring up the question
                            of missionaries particularly, as it had not been mentioned by the
                            Koreans. The presence of our people in the interior is not complained of
                            on the ground of their missionary character, and until they bring
                            forward this question I have thought best to diregard it. I will bear
                                <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0480"/>in mind your valuable
                            suggestion in regard to the liberality of the French treaty in this
                            respect, and use it when the necessity arises.</p>

                                minister for foreign affairs, attempting to explain the failure in
                                the execution of the instructions issued to the governor of North
                                Kyung-sang. The letter is very polite and entirely acceptable. I had
                                expected no reply, since the minister had spoken of the matter to me
                                in the course of conversation. I inclose a translation of this reply
                                from the foreign minister.</p>

                                from the magistrate of Sun Chun district of North Pengyang Province
                                saying that two Americans, Messrs. Whittemore and Sharrocks, were
                                buying land and building houses there; that he was trying to stop
                                them from doing so, but they refused to take his word, and that he
                                wanted me to write to you about it and to ask you to stop them.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to say that the buying land and building houses by

                                settlement is clearly not allowed in the treaty, and now these
                                Americans are buying land and building houses in the interior in
                                violation of the treaty, and the local authority has the right and

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Allen</hi>: Your letter of May 8,
                                concerning affairs at Sun Chun in North Pengyang Province, was
                                received a few days ago. I immediately requested Mr. Whittemore and
                                Dr. Sharrocks, who are now here, to prepare for you a statement of
                                the case, which statement I now send herewith.</p>
                            <p>My own understanding of the case is that they held the property in
                                Sun Chun, just as we held the property here in Pengyang for five or
                                six years, in the name of three Korean trustees. For full two years
                                after purchase of the property and practical residence there (on
                                passport) no question was raised. It seems that the new governor,
                                not the magistrate nor the people, has raised the question.</p>
                            <p>I think nothing in the situation violates the treaty, but with the
                                full explanation before you you will be able to judge as to that. I
                                would mention the fact that the French live in the interior, that a
                                French priest built a house which he occupies in a village in Sook
                                Chun County not to mention many other places, and that Japanese live
                                for long periods in the interior, that one has been and probably now
                                is living in An Ju.</p>
                            <p>Also it may be well for me to state that the article which appeared
                                in the Seoul newspaper is not a correct statement of facts.</p>
                            <p>I think the essentially important fact in the case is now before you.
                                Of coarse we shall be glad to give you the very fullest and detailed
                                statement in reply to any questions you may ask. I trust the
                                situation may not give you much trouble and that nothing may arise
                                which will necessitate a change in our plans for the welfare of the
                                work in and around Sun Chun.</p>
                            <p>With kindest regards, etc.,</p>

                            <head><hi rend="italic">Statement as to the Sun Chun
                                property.</hi></head>
                            <p>Property was purchased for our use early in December, 1898. From the
                                year 1898 to the present land has been purchased when a desirable
                                piece was for sale, being bought openly and undisputedly for our
                                use, and always before witnesses.</p>
                            <p>Taxes have been paid regularly since 1899.</p>
                            <p>The largest purchase, comprising nearly two-thirds of all that is
                                held for us, was made from the village school association, composed
                                of about one hundred men, many of whom are among the most
                                influential citizens of town. This purchase was made in October,
                                1900, and our intention to build upon the site was known to those
                                who sold it to us. We learned recently that three weeks previous to
                                this purchase the governor, who at that time was visiting Syen
                                Chyun, had spoken to the magistrate concerning our being there.</p>
                            <p>At that time, October, 1900, Messrs. Whittemore and Sharrocks called
                                upon the magistrate then in the office, who entertained them with
                                courtesy and respect, and in speaking of Americans residing in
                                Korea, said there were certainly no objections to Americans coming
                                into their country to live, for they came with no intention of doing
                                harm either to people or government, in which respect they differed
                                from the people of some nations. A residence has been occupied by
                                Mr. Whittemore since January, 1899. Taxes have always been paid by
                                the occupant.</p>
                            <p>During the time there have been three magistrates in office at Syen
                                Chyun, not one of whom has uttered a word of objection to our being
                                there, although opportunity for it has been given them by personal
                                calls, etc.</p>
                            <p>Early in February, 1900, we began active preparation for the erection
                                of a suitable house in which we could stay while in Syen Chyun, as
                                Mr. Whittemore has occupied his house since January, 1899.</p>
                            <p>In March the lumber and other material began to arrive on the site,
                                and from that time to the present work has been in active
                                process.</p>
                            <p>Up to date not a word has been said to us by any Korean official
                                opposing or calling in question our action, nor, so far as we know,
                                have our Korean employees received any complaint from them.</p>
                            <p>We did hear in April, by way of rumor, that the governor had inquired
                                of the magistrate concerning our doings and our names. We at once
                                sent our cards over with messages that we would be pleased to call
                                upon him if he was at leisure. Answer came back that he was
                                busy.</p>
                            <p>We have used every care to win for ourselves a good name among the
                                town’s people, and have every reason to feel gratified at our
                                success.</p>
                            <p>Even the present magistrate was reported to have said that our
                                building a house was a good work, and he had no objection to that,
                                but tearing down the people’s homes was not a good thing and must be
                                stopped. We had not destroyed a single house, but Mr. Whittemore’s
                                kangs had been pulled down and replaced by new ones. Since this
                                reported utterance of the magistrates an old vacated house (land and
                                improvements valued at 7 yen) had been carried off by the Koreans
                                with our consent.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: During your absence on
                                sick leave I received a letter from Acting Minister Che Yung Ha, No.
                                27, of May 7, in regard to two Americans, Messrs. Whittemore and
                                Sharrocks, who were said to be buying land and building houses at
                                Sun Chun, in the province of North Pengyang, the magistrate of that
                                place having reported that he had tried to prevent them from so
                                doing, but that they would not heed his word.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to inform you that at once upon the receipt of your
                                predecessor’s letter I called upon the Americans in question for a
                                report on the matter. I now have this report, and am able to inform
                                you as follows:</p>
                            <p>Americans do not own any land in their own names at Sun Chun. For
                                some years American missionaries, whose permanent residence may be
                                considered as at Pengyang, have been traveling to and residing
                                temporarily in the town of Sun Chun, where <pb n="402"
                                    xml:id="pg_402" facs="0482"/>they seem to have had the good will
                                and friendship of the people and the officials. Since 1898 they have
                                secured the use of land and houses in the name of certain Koreans,
                                and are now about to improve this property for their entertainment
                                and use. They have never been informed by the magistrate or other
                                official that there was any objection to their so doing; in fact
                                they have been led to suppose that their presence was desired rather
                                than objected to.</p>
                            <p>No official has spoken to them or tried to have them stop the
                                improvements of the property. When the governor of North Pengyang,
                                Ye Toh Chai, was at Sun Chun some time ago, Messrs Whittemore and
                                Sharrocks sent him their cards and asked to be allowed to come to
                                him for the purpose of paying their respects, but they received a
                                reply saying that the governor was busy. After this they heard some
                                rumors among the people that the governor was not pleased with their
                                presence, but they received no complaint, direct or implied.</p>
                            <p>Now chat the matter has been brought to me, I can only quote from my
                                letter of December 17, No. 253, regarding the presence of Americans
                                at Taikoo.</p>
                            <p>“I am entirely willing to admit that, by the provisions of the
                                treaties, the permanent residence of Americans in Korea must be at
                                the ports or places opened to trade, or within the treaty limits
                                thereof. At the same time, by Article IV, section 6, of the British
                                treaty (which is applicable to the United States as well, by virtue
                                of the most favored-nation clause of the treaty with the United
                                States) it is expressly provided that Americrns may freely travel in
                                the interior of Korea on passport for purposes of pleasure, trade,
                                or the purchase and transport of goods. If my people are thus able
                                to travel and reside temporarily in the interior on passport, they
                                are certainly at liberty to secure food and lodging while
                                sojourning, in the country. I admit also the fact, that without
                                special permission they are not at liberty to own real estate in the
                                interior, and for that reason, when it has become necessary to
                                secure a dwelling house, owing to the absence of a system of rentals
                                in Korea, my people have always done this in the name of a Korean,
                                so as not to violate the treaty provisions. I have personal
                                knowledge that persons of other nationalities do not put themselves
                                to this inconvenience, but actually acquire such property outright,
                                with the sanction of the local Korean authorities. This being the
                                case, I can not well forbid my people from following the harmless
                                custom of which the case in point is an illustration.”</p>
                            <p>I trust I have made it clear to your excellency that my people have
                                not violated the treaty provisions; they have not bought property in
                                the interior in their own names; they have not refused to listen to
                                the objections of the Korean officials; they are on friendly terms
                                with the local officials, and they tried to pay their respects to
                                the governor, but were refused admission to his presence.</p>
                            <p>I may add that Mr. Whittemore is a teacher, and I know he has refused
                                to take part in controversies of his Korean friends with the
                                officials, counseling them to obey the laws of the land in all
                                particulars. Dr. Sharrocks is a medical man, whose gratuitous
                                ministrations are for the benefit of the people. The labors of these
                                men for the good of the people seem to be appreciated by the people
                                themselves, and in some countries similar services are paid for in
                                money, while in this case they are freely given without cost.</p>
                            <p>While I might base these representations upon even stronger grounds,
                                I think this will be sufficient to convince your excellency that no
                                wrong has been done and that none is intended by my people. I hope
                                the matter may be dropped.</p>
                            <p>I take this opportunity, etc.,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: Referring to my dispatch,
                                No. 253, of December 17 last, regarding the ill-treatment of
                                Americans at Taiku, in North Kyung Sang Province, I beg to remind
                                your excellency that on February 1 last I wrote you a long dispatch
                                detailing the whole case, showing how my people had been wronged and
                                their treaty rights violated, and intimating that as I had been
                                unable to obtain satisfaction for these acts of the officials at
                                Taiku, I would be compelled to fall back upon instructions issued by
                                my Government to my predecessor, and demand equal privileges for
                                Americans in the matter of residence in the interior as are enjoyed
                                by people of other nationalities, which would amount to a
                                recognition of the practical nullification <pb n="403"
                                    xml:id="pg_403" facs="0483"/>by usage and established custom of
                                the treaty provision against residence in the interior.</p>
                            <p>When this letter was seen by His Majesty your excellency visited me
                                and assured me of your firm intention to adjust this matter in a
                                manner satisfactory to me. As a result of promises you made to me in
                                the presence of your vice-minister, I agreed to withdraw this
                                dispatch upon receipt of a copy of instructions you said you would
                                send to the new governor of North Kyung Sang. I left with you the
                                Chinese translation of my dispatch that you might hand it to the new
                                governor for his instruction.</p>
                            <p>On February 26 you wrote me a dispatch announcing that you had issued
                                instructions to the Taiku officials, rebuking them for their
                                conduct, warning them against a repetition of the same, and ordering
                                the arrest and trial of the man Noh Chusah. You sent me a copy of
                                these instructions, which, being satisfactory to me, I withdrew my
                                dispatch of February 1.</p>
                            <p>I have now received a report from the Americans at Taiku, dated May
                                18. They say that as the new governor, YeYou In, had been in Taiku
                                for over a month and they had heard nothing of the matter in
                                question, they called upon him to pay their respects and to make
                                inquiries. The governor informed them that he had never heard of the
                                matter until that moment. He told them to say to me that he “had no
                                instructions from the minister for foreign affairs on the subject;
                                that he had heard nothing of it before coming down, and that my
                                speaking of it was the first he had heard.”</p>
                            <p>I am also informed that nothing had been done to the man Noh Chusah,
                                whom you at first offered to punish severely and later agreed, with
                                my consent, to have his case promptly and carefully investigated
                                first.</p>
                            <p>I now learn, also, that the man Kim Tek Yung, whose arrest and
                                inhuman beating caused the previous correspondence to which this
                                refers, has again been arrested, this time on the charge that an
                                uncle of his in former times made illegal use of Government funds.
                                The new governor frankly remarked to the Americans in regard to this
                                man Kim, that he “would probably kill him.” I need not go into the
                                details of this arrest. The charges seem to be of an absurdly
                                trivial nature, and I must conclude that they are brought by the
                                underlings of the yamen in order to vent their spleen upon the man
                                for having secured foreign intervention last December.</p>
                            <p>It is very humiliating to me to have to address your excellency in
                                this manner and to be forced to the conclusion that I have been
                                trifled with and that your solemn official agreements have been
                                disregarded or not carried out.</p>
                            <p>Under the circumstances, I can only send a full official report to my
                                Government on the subject and hand you my recalled dispatch<note
                                    n="a" xml:id="d337fna">Printed ante, <ref target="#pg_392">page

                                do so hand you that dispatch herewith.</p>
                            <p>I am compelled to abide by the resolution mentioned in that dispatch
                                and put into execution the instructions already received from my
                                Government. I shall not entertain any more complaints in regard to
                                the mere residence of Americans in the interior, on passport, such
                                as that to which my dispatch of May 27 is a reply.</p>

                                acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the date of June 1 in
                                regard to the matter of the Americans being ill treated in Taiku by
                                the Korean officers.</p>
                            <p>I beg to inform you that I instructed the new governor of North Kiung
                                Sang Province several times, and I handed him the copy of the
                                translation of your letter which you handed me in my office and an
                                instruction of mine when he started for his post, and I thought he
                                would manage it very carefully and properly in accordance with what
                                I instructed him.</p>
                            <p>I am much astonished to hear that he said to the Americans that he
                                had never heard of the matter at all. I am wondering, although it is
                                improbable, that he may have lost all his papers.</p>
                            <p>I have instructed again the governor to treat the Americans very
                                nicely and politely, so there will not be any look of cool
                                treatment, and that he must investigate into the matter in question
                                very carefully, and manage it fairly and justly.</p>

                        <p>Sir: Referring to my dispatch No. 359, of June 7, in regard to the
                            failure of the Korean Government to carry out its instructions in regard
                            to the matter of the settlement of the case of the violation of the
                            domicile of Americans at Taiku, I now have the honor to hand you
                            inclosed a copy of a letter I have received from the Rev. James E.
                            Adams, of Taiku, in which the writer shows that upon receipt of new
                            instructions as a result of my interview with the minister for foreign
                            affairs, mentioned in above-cited dispatch, the governor at Taiku called
                            him (Mr. Adams) in and began an investigation of the matter.</p>
                        <p>The governor upbraided the official who had been chiefly instrumental in
                            causing trouble to the Americans, dismissed him from his office, and
                            ordered him to personally reimburse the Americans for their money loss.
                            The man, with his accomplice, fled to escape arrest and they have not
                            yet been captured.</p>
                        <p>This action on the part of the governor will have a most salutary effect,
                            and I anticipate no more trouble to the Americans in that locality.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Allen</hi>: I have been waiting a
                                long time in order to see the end of our business before writing to
                                you, but as the end seems indefinitely in the future, through the
                                principal offender having run away, I have concluded to write
                                anyway. After your last communication to the foreign office they at
                                once sent down here and ordered the business settled up. The
                                governor called me in and asked me to give a full account of the
                                whole affair, which I did. He then called to Noh Chussa and
                                questioned him. Noh denied taking any bribe in the case. The
                                governor upbraided him for treating us as he did in the
                                administration of the case; said that he was unfit for his office if
                                he knew no more than that about how to treat foreigners who were
                                here under definite treaty rights, and then dismissed him from his
                                office. He further adjudicated that, as Noh had been the instrument,
                                either through his ignorance <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0485"
                                />of law or his corruption by bribes, which, was immaterial, of the
                                maladministration of justice and our failure to be reimbursed in our
                                losses, and as the tile burner, Soh, now was poor and unable to pay
                                the bill, Noh himself should reimburse us for the full amount for
                                which we had sued Soh. He issued an order for the arrest of Soh, in
                                order to find out more definitely about the bribery charge, and
                                closed the case. That night both Soh and Noh fled the country: I
                                have heard nothing more of the matter since. I understand that Noh
                                went to Seoul and that the governor had dispatched a policeman after
                                him. So far as the governor’s adjudication of the case was
                                concerned, we could not have asked for more.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your instruction to Secretary McCreery, No. 509, of April 18,
                            1901, and accompanying document, viz, a copy of certain resolutions
                            passed by the Chamber of Commerce of El Paso, Tex., * * * relating to
                            the matter of arrests of American conductors and engineers employed on
                            railways in Mexico, for responsibility in railway accidents.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>Referring again to the general question, I called Señor Mariscal’s
                            attention to the strength and influence of the different railway men’s
                            organizations in the United States, and that in my judgment they were
                            agitating the question in the interests of the members of their orders
                            who had, in some instances, been, subjected to great hardships. I
                            remarked that it was not for me to question the wisdom of the Mexican
                            law under which arrests and imprisonments were made; that I had, in some
                            instances in the past, notably the Turner case, complained of the
                            apparently unnecessary delay in bringing the persons accused of such
                            offenses to final trial. I said it would be an act of great satisfaction
                            to my Government and be highly appreciated by it if his Government would
                            adopt some plan by which, in the future, cases of this character would
                            be disposed of promptly by the courts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mariscal replied that he had in mind the issuance of a circular
                            letter to the different judicial officers under whose jurisdiction such
                            cases would come upon the subject; that he would give the matter his
                            very careful attention with the view of bringing about the expedition of
                            such cases and the prevention of just causes for complaint.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>For the purpose of furnishing data to enable me to report upon the
                            general subject of the arrest and imprisonment, in Mexico, of employees
                            on railways, engaged in the movement of trains, I directed Secretary
                            Heimké to carefully examine the records of this legation, during my
                            incumbency of over four years, and report to me each case that has been
                            brought to the attention of the legation during that time, with
                            information as to the employment of the accused, date of complaint, date
                            and place of imprisonment, accusation, when reported to the foreign
                            office and State Department, date of final trial, and final action upon
                            the part of the courts. This information Mr. Heimké has furnished in the
                            succinct and well prepared tabulated statement,<note n="a"

                        <p>From this statement I find that, during the period referred to, only
                            twelve complaints have been made to this legation, either directly by
                            the person seeking its good offices, or by other in his behalf. The
                            facts concerning the arrest, and action of the court, in each case, are
                            as follows:</p>

                        <p>Trask was imprisoned November 2, 1900, and remained in jail until
                            February 9, 1901, the date of his final trial, at which time he was
                            discharged.</p>
                        <p>Jones was arrested and imprisoned March 13, 1901, and detained in prison
                            until May 11, 1901, at which time he was released on a $300 cash bond.
                            Case still pending.</p>
                        <p>Granville was arrested and imprisoned March 18, 1901. Case still
                            pending.</p>
                        <p>Bradt and Preston were both imprisoned April 1, 1897, and after remaining
                            in prison until January 3, 1898, they were both convicted and sentenced
                            to one year’s imprisonment.</p>
                        <p>Pike was imprisoned May 5, 1899, and after remaining in prison until
                            August 4, 1899, was convicted and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment,
                            from May 9, 1899.</p>
                        <p>Clark was imprisoned April 1, 1899, and remained in prison until March
                            17, 1900, when he was convicted and sentenced to fourteen months’
                            imprisonment. After serving six months of said sentence he was pardoned
                            by the President, and released.</p>
                        <p>Turner was imprisoned April 1, 1899, and remained in prison until January
                            28, 1900, awaiting trial, on which date he died in the prison
                            hospital.</p>
                        <p>There being no just cause for complaint in the case of Anderson, it was
                            not brought to the attention of the foreign office nor reported to the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>For the purpose of obtaining information as to what extent railway
                            employees of the before-mentioned classes were being arrested and
                            imprisoned by the Mexican authorities, on the 8th of May last I
                            addressed a communication to all of the railway companies in the
                            Republic of Mexico, requesting to be informed of the number and
                            nationality (Mexicans included) of all of their employees engaged in the
                            movement of trains, such as engineers, firemen, conductors, brake-men,
                            and switchmen, and a list giving the name and nationality of each
                            (Mexicans included) who had been arrested and imprisoned during the past
                            year, growing out of alleged negligence, causing accidents, endangering
                            the lives of persons or causing destruction of property. To these
                            communications I have received answers from all of the companies, except
                            the following: Mexican Mineral; Merida, Progreso and Yzamal;
                            Tehuantepec; Peninsular; San Marcos and Tecolutla; Merida-Peto; and the
                            Potosí and Rio Verde.</p>
                        <p>The mileage of the companies from which I have received answers is 7,365
                            miles. The mileage of those from which I have received no reply is 547
                            miles.</p>
                        <p>The information received, I think, is practically sufficient for the
                            purposes of this report, and has Seen condensed in a tabulated form <pb
                                n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0490"/>by Secretary Heimké, from which
                            it will be seen that of the total number of Americans employed as
                            conductors, the percentage of those arrested and imprisoned is greater
                            than that of the Mexicans so employed; upon the other hand, of the total
                            number of Mexicans employed as engineers, the percentage of those
                            arrested and imprisoned is greater than that of the Americans so
                            employed.</p>
                        <p>The information obtained also shows that the reports of the arrests and
                            imprisonments of these classes of employees have been greatly
                            exaggerated by the newspapers in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The trouble seems to lie in the law itself more than in its execution. In
                            a conversation with Mr. Mariscal upon the subject, he informed me that
                            he did not know of a single case, under Mexican law, where rail-, way
                            companies had been held responsible for accidents; that the policy of
                            their law seemed to be to hold their employees responsible. I explained
                            to him how, in the United States, the opposite principle obtained,
                            resulting in the railway companies exercising the greatest care as to
                            the efficiency and carefulness of their employees engaged in the
                            movement of trains; that I believed if the same principle were adopted
                            in Mexico the railway companies would pursue the same policy, which
                            would result in a higher class of employees being employed, and less
                            accidents.</p>
                        <p>I have been greatly delayed in the rendition of this report awaiting
                            information from the various railway companies.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            dispatch, No. 998, of the 27th ultimo, containing a very exhaustive
                            report on the arrest and imprisonment in Mexico of American citizens
                            employed on Mexican railroads for criminal negligence in causing
                            accidents to the trains in their charge.</p>
                        <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0491"/>
                        <p>You will continue to remonstrate on all proper occasions against the
                            delay in discharging or bringing to trial Americans charged With
                            responsibility for such accidents, and you will lose no opportunity to
                            impress upon Mr. Mariscal the proposition that the preventive and
                            remedial objects of Mexican legislation in respect to railway accidents
                            would be no less well—and perhaps better—subserved by following the
                            general rule of law in that regard in other countries.</p>
                        <p>The policy of protecting the public against loss of life or physical
                            injury in railway travel, through the criminal negligence of railway
                            employees, is enforced by penal legislation in the United States, and we
                            should not, of course, indicate any opposition to that policy in Mexico,
                            although keeping on the alert to remonstrate against abusive procedure
                            thereunder. But, while not shifting criminal accountability from the
                            shoulders of the employee, the same laws hold the employing company
                            responsible in damages for injury to life, person, or property through
                            the acts of its agents. As the case now stands, it is not easy to see
                            how the family of a person killed or the owners of property destroyed in
                            such cases may be materially benefited by the prolonged imprisonment of
                            a mere railway subordinate while the sufferers remain without recourse
                            against the company. An equitable division of responsibility in such
                            matters would, it is thought, tend to the prevention of accidents and
                            remove, to a considerable extent, the causes of complaint we are so
                            often called upon to make in view of the needless and protracted
                            confinement of our citizens in Mexico, besides distinctly inuring to the
                            benefit of sufferers by such accidents.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your letter of the 11th
                                of last April, communicating certain resolutions adopted by the
                                board of directors of the El Paso Chamber of Commerce on the 10th of
                                that month, concerning the character of Mexican judicial procedure
                                in respect to accidents occurring upon railway lines in Mexico, I
                                have the pleasure to inform you that the ambassador to Mexico, to
                                whom the matter was appropriately referred, has submitted to the
                                Department, under date of June 27, 1901, a full and comprehensive
                                report on the subject.</p>
                            <p>It appears from Mr. Clayton’s statements that the publications upon
                                the subject which from time to time appear in the press of this
                                country are greatly exaggerated. * * *</p>
                            <p>Following up the investigation, Mr. Clayton addressed letters to the
                                presidents of all of the railway companies operating roads in
                                Mexico, requesting to be informed of the number and nationality
                                (Mexican included) of all of their employees engaged in the movement
                                of trains, and to be furnished with a list giving the names and
                                nationality of each one who had been arrested and imprisoned during
                                the past year on charge of negligence, causing accidents,
                                endangering life or property. He had at the time of writing received
                                replies from the principal companies representing 7,365 miles of
                                road out of a total Mexican mileage of 7,912.</p>
                            <p>From these it appeared that out of a total of over 400 employees of
                                all national ties, 20 Mexicans, 32 Americans, and 1 of unknown
                                nationality have been arrested or imprisoned during the year. Most
                                of these appear to have been soon released on <pb n="412"
                                    xml:id="pg_412" facs="0492"/>bond, or on the guarantee of the
                                company that the man should appear to answer a charge whenever
                                called upon. Others, upon trial, have been acquitted. So far as
                                these replies show, none of the men so arrested was convicted. In
                                some few instances prolonged delay and detention had followed
                                arrest. While nearly all companies disclaim all ground of complaint
                                touching the treatment of their employees by the Mexican judicial
                                authorities, their answers are not explicit as to the time of
                                detention, and the Sonora Bail way Company merely reports the names
                                of 17 employees (8 Americans, 8 Mexicans, and 1 unknown) who had
                                been imprisoned on account of railway accidents from June 1, 1900,
                                to June 1, 1901, a singularly large showing, it may be remarked, for
                                a road having only 268 miles in operation and but 62 men employed in
                                the actual movement of the trains. The eventual disposition of these
                                cases is not stated.</p>
                            <p>The embassy is accustomed to exert itself actively to secure the
                                prompt disposal of the cases of arrested American railway employees,
                                but not all such arrested are brought to its notice. During Mr.
                                Clayton’s incumbency of over four years, but 12 complaints of this
                                character have been under consideration.</p>
                            <p>They are as follows:</p>
                            <p>F. H. Anderson, engineer on the Sonora Railroad, charged in August,
                                1897, with running over and killing a Mexican; detained on his own
                                recognizance; discharged after hearing August 23, 1897.</p>
                            <p>J. N. Bradt and Jack Preston, conductor and engineer, respectively,
                                on the Mexican Southern Railroad, imprisoned April 1, 1897, charged
                                with the death of a fireman and the injury of three or four others;
                                sentenced January 3, 1898, to one year imprisonment.</p>
                            <p>E. Hohne and C. N. Gaines, conductor and engineer, respectively, on
                                the Inter-oceanic Railroad, imprisoned April 15, 1899, charged with
                                slightly injuring two or three persons in a collision; released May
                                8, 1899, on $800 bail; discharged November 24, 1899.</p>
                            <p>Edward Turner and G. S. Clark, engineers on the Mexican (Vera Cruz)
                                Railroad, imprisoned April 1, 1899, charged with negligence in
                                causing a needless collision that resulting in killing a fireman.
                                Turner died in prison January 28, 1900, before termination of his
                                case. Clark was convicted and sentenced to fourteen months’
                                imprisonment less the eight months spent by him in prison during his
                                trial; pardoned by President Diaz August 1, 1900.</p>
                            <p>Henry Pike, engineer on the Mexican Interoceanic Railroad, imprisoned
                                May 5, 1899, charged with causing a collision, resulting in no
                                personal harm, but damaging rolling stock; convicted and sentenced
                                August 4, 1899, to one year imprisonment from May 8, 1899.</p>
                            <p>T. W. Lewis, engineer on Mexican Central Railroad, imprisoned
                                September 25, 1900, charged with running over a Mexican; acquitted
                                December 8, 1900; discharged December 20, 1900.</p>
                            <p>Albert Trask, conductor on the Tehuantepec Railroad, imprisoned
                                November 9, 1900, charged with causing a collision, resulting in no
                                personal injury and causing but little damage to rolling stock;
                                acquitted and released February 9, 1901.</p>
                            <p>A. K. Jones, engineer on the El Oro and Mining Railroad, imprisoned
                                February 13, 1901, charged with causing a wreck, resulting in two
                                deaths and the injury of rolling stock; released May 11, 1901, on
                                $300 cash bond; case still pending.</p>
                            <p>L. L. Granville, brakeman on the Mexican National Railroad,
                                imprisoned March 18, 1901, for causing the death of a laborer by
                                running over him; trial of case still pending.</p>
                            <p>It appears from the foregoing statement that out of 12 Americans
                                arrested, 4 were convicted of the offense charged and were sentenced
                                to short terms of imprisonment, 5 were discharged, 2 cases are still
                                pending, and 1 man (Turner, whose case occasioned protracted
                                correspondence) died in jail after nearly nine months’ imprisonment
                                while still awaiting trial.</p>
                            <p>Although the period of detention of such arrested persons prior to
                                release on bail or discharge has in many instances been brief, there
                                remain enough cases of protracted imprisonment, especially when the
                                accused is held for trial, to warrant the repeated protests of this
                                Government against the delays of Mexican justice. In addition the
                                ambassador has strongly pointed out that the difference between
                                Mexican and American laws in respect to railway accidents works
                                hardship to the employees in Mexico, in that the agent, not the
                                principal, is held responsible.</p>
                            <p>As to this, the ambassador says: “The trouble seems to lie in the law
                                itself, more than in its execution. In a conversation with Mr.
                                Mariscal upon the subject he informed me that he did not know of a
                                single case, under Mexican law, where railway companies had been
                                held responsible for accidents; that the policy of their law seemed
                                to be to hold their employees responsible. I explained to him how,
                                in the United States, the opposite principle obtained, resulting in
                                the railway companies <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0493"
                                />exercising the greatest care as to the efficiency and carefulness
                                of their employees engaged in the movement of trains; that I
                                believed if the same principle were adopted in Mexico the railway
                                companies would pursue the same policy, which would result in a
                                higher class of employees being employed, and less accidents.”</p>
                            <p>Mr. Clayton reports that Señor Mariscal has in mind the issuance of a
                                circular letter upon the subject to the different judicial officers
                                under whose jurisdiction such cases come, and that he will give the
                                matter his very careful attention, with the view of bringing about
                                the expedition of such cases and the prevention of just causes for
                                complaint.</p>
                            <p>I have instructed Mr. Clayton to continue to remonstrate upon all
                                proper occasions against the delay in discharging or bringing to
                                trial Americans charged with responsibility for accidents on Mexican
                                railway lines, and to lose no opportunity to impress upon Señor
                                Mariscal the proposition that the preventive and remedial objects of
                                Mexican legislation in respect to railway accidents would be no less
                                well, and perhaps better, subserved by following the general rule of
                                law in other countries. The policy of protecting the public against
                                loss of life or physical injury in railway travel through the
                                criminal negligence of railway employees is enforced by penal
                                legislation in the United States, and we should not, of course,
                                indicate any opposition to that policy in Mexico, although keeping
                                on the alert to remonstrate against abusive procedure thereunder.
                                But while not shifting criminal accountability from the shoulders of
                                the employees, the same laws hold the employing company responsible
                                in damages for injury to life, person, or property through the acts
                                of its agents. As the case now stands, it is not easy to see how the
                                family of a person killed or the owners of property destroyed in
                                such cases may be materially benefited by the prolonged imprisonment
                                of a mere railway subordinate, while the sufferers remain without
                                recourse against the company. An equitable division of
                                responsibility in such matters would, it is thought, tend to the
                                prevention of accidents and remove to a considerable degree the
                                causes of complaint we are so often called upon to make in view of
                                the needless and protracted confinement of our citizens in Mexico,
                                besides distinctly inuring to the benefit of sufferers by such
                                accidents.</p>
                            <p>Yours, etc.,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge
                                receipt of your letter of July 16, 1901, containing the substance of
                                the report of Ambassador Clayton concerning Mexican judicial
                                procedure in respect to accidents occurring upon railway lines in
                                Mexico, and also setting forth at some length your own views and
                                conclusions with regard to this matter.</p>
                            <p>I am instructed by the board of directors to express to you, on
                                behalf of the El Paso Chamber of Commerce, cordial recognition and
                                hearty appreciation of the interest that you have taken in this
                                question and the efforts that have been made by Ambassador Clayton,
                                under your instructions, to secure accurate information as to the
                                grounds for complaint by American railway employees in Mexico.</p>
                            <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0494"/>
                            <p>The El Paso Chamber of Commerce respectfully proffers its cooperation
                                and aid in securing further data, and will institute specific
                                inquiry for the purpose of verifying or supplementing the statistics
                                and information contained in your letter.</p>
                            <p>With a view to facilitating such further inquiry and pursuit of the
                                facts, we beg to submit the following observations, suggested by
                                your letter of July 16: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>It is conceded that some of the alleged cases of injustice
                                        can be traced to sensational or highly exaggerated newspaper
                                        accounts of unimportant incidents, or even to pure invention
                                        without any basis of fact.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>We respectfully submit that the statements of the railway
                                        companies in Mexico are not to be taken as conclusive
                                        evidence, for two reasons: (1) The railway companies are
                                        interested parties, it being to their advantage pecuniarily
                                        that the present procedure in Mexico, which throws the
                                        burden of liability upon the employee, should be maintained.
                                        (2) Railway companies in Mexico evidently do not make it the
                                        duty of their officials to secure and preserve records of
                                        such imprisonment of their employees. It is rather to the
                                        interest of the railway companies that they should remain
                                        officially ignorant of matters an official knowledge of
                                        which might imply obligation to assist employees in distress
                                        or might embarrass the companies in their efforts to secure
                                        fresh American employees to replace those who had suffered
                                        injustice in discharge of the duties incident to railway
                                        service in Mexico.</item>
                                    <label>3.</label>
                                    <item>Railway companies may well “disclaim all ground of
                                        complaint touching the treatment of their employees by the
                                        Mexican judicial authorities,” as noted in your letter,
                                        since the Mexican procedure relieves the company of
                                        responsibility for accident and throws the responsibility
                                        upon the employee.</item>
                                    <label>4.</label>
                                    <item>It is noted in your letter that the answers of the railway
                                        companies to Mr. Clayton’s inquiries are “not explicit as to
                                        the time of detention.” We respectfully submit that this is
                                        a vital point. It is a fundamental principle of our law that
                                        justice shall be not only sure, but speedy. It is highly
                                        important to know how many days, or weeks, or months the
                                        imprisoned American citizen must spend in the Mexican jail,
                                        enduring the conditions and subsisting upon the food
                                        characteristic of Mexican jails; among people of strange
                                        race and tongue, through whom he is powerless to send any
                                        message that might bring to his relief the mighty forces of
                                        the American State. You have noted the “singularly large
                                        showing” of American railway employees imprisoned in the
                                        State Sonora during the past year, with no account rendered
                                        as to the eventual disposition of their cases, and with no
                                        assurance that there are not to-day American citizens
                                        dragging out miserable lives in unjust imprisonment in some
                                        of the jails of Sonora.</item>
                                    <label>5.</label>
                                    <item>No one doubts that the American Government, through its
                                        State Department and its embassy to Mexico, purposes to
                                        employ all means deemed proper, practicable, and effective
                                        to protect the rights of American citizens in Mexico. But,
                                        as noted in your letter, “not all such arrests are brought
                                        to its notice.” It is this fact which calls for further
                                        action by the American Government, to the end that every
                                        American citizen employed in Mexico shall be assured of
                                        opportunity to bring any case of alleged injustice to the
                                        attention of the American embassy. The fact is significant
                                        that, as noted in your letter, “during Mr. Clayton’s
                                        incumbency of over four years but twelve complaints of this
                                        character have been under consideration.” It is commonly
                                        believed in this part of the United States that accidents
                                        leading to such imprisonment in Mexico are much more
                                        frequent than is indicated by the statistics received by Mr.
                                        Clayton from the railway companies. The fact that, as noted
                                        by you, of the thirty-two reported cases of arrest and
                                        imprisonment of American railway employees in Mexico during
                                        the past year, eight cases are reported in connection with
                                        268 miles of railway in Sonora, leaving but twenty-four
                                        cases reported for over 7,000 miles of railway throughout
                                        the rest of Mexico, and the further fact that out of a total
                                        of sixty-two railway employees in train service in Sonora,
                                        seventeen were arrested and imprisoned in one year, while
                                        but thirty-six arrests are reported for the remaining four
                                        thousand employees throughout Mexico—these facts are, if not
                                        conclusive proof of the unreliability of the statistics,
                                        significant enough to warrant and urge further
                                        inquiry.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>We are gratified to note your conclusion, as stated in your letter,
                                that “there remain enough cases of protracted imprisonment,
                                especially when the accused is held fox trial, to warrant the
                                repeated protests of this Government against the delays of Mexican
                                justice.” We are equally gratified to note the vigor and persistency
                                of the American State Department in pressing upon the Mexican
                                Government the propriety and advisability, from every point of view
                                except that of the pecuniary interests of the railway companies, of
                                amending the Mexican law so as to bring Mexican procedure into
                                conformity with that of the United States and other nations with
                                respect to the incidence of responsibility for accidents in railway
                                service.</p>
                            <p>We beg to suggest that more complete, accurate, and reliable
                                information can be secured through the organizations of railway
                                employees than through the reports of <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415"
                                    facs="0495"/>Mexican railway companies or Mexican officials
                                regarding cases of alleged unjust imprisonment of American railway
                                employees in Mexico. To invite reports through this suggested
                                channel would probably result in bringing a large number of cases of
                                alleged unjust imprisonment before the State Department. In many of
                                these cases doubtless the imprisoned American would be accorded
                                substantial justice by the Mexican authorities without appeal to his
                                Government. But the very fact that the prisoner is assured of quick
                                and easy appeal to his Government will be the best possible
                                safeguard against injustice, and the strongest possible guaranty of
                                a speedy trial and disposition of his case. Moreover, if but one
                                American citizen out of a hundred thus arrested were by this means
                                protected against prolonged imprisonment or unjust sentence, the
                                personal right to life and liberty guaranteed by the American
                                Constitution to every American citizen fully establishes the
                                obligation of the United States Government to secure to this
                                individual citizen both the protection of the American Government
                                and the opportunity to present his appeal for such protection.</p>

                            wedding was given at the city hall. This event was hailed by a general
                            display of flags from all the Government and public buildings, the
                            various foreign legations and ministers’ residences, and a large number

                        <p>From last Monday, the 4th instant, the city has been en fête, all the
                            principal thoroughfares being gaily decorated during the day and
                            illuminated at night.</p>
                        <p>On that day the soldiers donned their full tenue, and in the afternoon an
                            enormous band of musicians, representing music corps and societies from
                            all parts of the country, assembled before the palace with their
                            varied-colored banners and played the national anthem and popular airs.
                            Immediately after they marched in procession through the town, while the
                            Queen received in audience delegates from the provinces who tendered the
                            felicitations of their respective districts. Early in the evening the
                            Queen was serenaded by a very large company of vocalists selected from
                            the best singers of The Hague and Rotterdam, the houses were lighted up
                            with illuminations and the thousands of people who thronged the streets
                            were in ecstacies in their rejoicing over the great coming event. While
                            everything was at its brightest the two Queens, accompanied by the Duke,
                            proceeded to the railway station to welcome the foreign princes and
                            immediate relatives on their arrival in The Hague.</p>
                        <p>On Tuesday, the 5th instant, the Queen granted an audience to the chiefs
                            of the foreign missions and the representatives of various corporations,
                            that they might present their last felicitations and wedding gifts.
                            Early in the afternoon other musical bodies greeted the Queen in song
                            from the palace gardens, and at the termination thereof the royal party
                            drove through the city and neighborhood in full state. At night there
                            was a gala dinner at the palace, to which were invited all the foreign
                            ministers, the court officials, in addition to all the royal guests, and
                            immediately upon the close the whole company attended at the opera
                            house, where a special musical display was given in honor of the
                            occasion. After the theater the royal guests, the court and some of the
                            Dutch people were entertained at the German legation, where the German
                            minister had prepared an elaborate soirée. No member of the diplomatic
                            corps, except the Russian minister and two others, was invited.</p>
                        <p>On Wednesday, shortly after noon, there was a large procession of a great
                            many trades and artisans before the palace and through the town, after
                            which the royal party again drove through the streets and vicinity,
                            accompanied, as on the preceding day, by a full escort. That evening
                            there was a grand soirée at the palace, to which all the diplomatic
                            corps, the élite, and military were invited, and at which some of the
                            leading members of Dutch society gave a series of tableaux vivants,
                            representative of graphic pictures from the history of the houses of the
                            Orange and Mecklenburg families.</p>
                        <p>The wedding morning was an exceptionally fine one, the route to the
                            church was crowded hours before the ceremony took place with an
                            expectant and glad throng of people, and at every point of vantage eager
                            spectators were to be observed. The civil part of the ceremony took
                            place at the palace, the minister of justice, assisted by the secretary
                            of the city corporation, being the officiating functionaries, while the
                            presidents of the States-General, the court of justice, the council of
                            state, the chief officer of the court, and an important military officer
                            acted as witnesses, the only attendants being the nearest family
                            relatives. From the palace the wedding party proceeded to the church in
                            a stately procession. The route was lined by soldiers and police and an
                            eager and exulting crowd. Long before the arrival of the Sovereign <pb
                                n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0498"/>the diplomatic corps in full
                            force, the members of the States-General, together with the élite of the
                            whole country and a large press representation had assembled to witness
                            the public performance in the church. From beginning to end there was
                            nothing to mar the general gayety and pleasure of the occasion.</p>
                        <p>The ceremony in the “Groote Kerk” was singularly beautiful and
                            impressive, and reached its climax when at the close of the marriage
                            service the officiating Dutch Reformed clergyman, Mr. van der Flier,
                            made the customary present of a Bible to the royal bride, who was
                            standing radiant in the sunlight, which for an instant streamed in at
                            the windows. It seemed to me as I looked around that there were no dry
                            eyes in the church.</p>
                        <p>The return to the palace was as grand and enthusiastic as the procession
                            thither.</p>
                        <p>At 4 o’clock the royal pair started for the palace in the country, “Het
                            Lee,” where they pass the honeymoon, making their next appearance in
                            Amsterdam at the beginning of March next.</p>
                        <p>The universal approval of this love match is very touching, and I am told
                            that the people believe that the “orange weather” (fine weather) during
                            the service is a sure sign of a happy married life.</p>
                        <p>A few days prior to the wedding Duke Hendrik was by royal order appointed
                            rear-admiral of the Netherlands navy, lieutenant-general of the
                            Netherlands army and of the Colonial army, all three appointments being
                            a la suite, and therefore honorary. Immediately after the marriage a
                            special issue of the Netherlands Gazette appeared announcing the
                            marriage and containing two royal orders, whereby the duke was
                            proclaimed a prince of the Netherlands, and conferring upon him the
                            right to act as advisory member of the Netherlands council of state.</p>
                        <p>At the audience of the 5th instant Her Majesty the Queen wishes me to
                            thank the President for his kindness and to express her gratitude for
                            the many evidences of good will and sympathy which she had received from
                            the American people.</p>

                        <p>The information given below is believed to be correct, yet is not to be
                            considered as official, as it relates to the laws and regulations of a
                            foreign country.</p>
                        <p>A subject of the Netherlands is liable to military service from his
                            nineteenth to his fortieth year. He must register to take part in the
                            drawing of lots for military service between January 1 and August 31 of
                            the calendar year in which he reaches the age of 19. He is exempt,
                            however, from service if he is an only son or is physically disabled;
                                <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0499"/>and in the case of a family

                            uneven.</p>
                        <p>No military service is required of one who became a citizen of the United
                            States before the calendar year in which he became 19 years of age, and
                            a Netherlands subject who becomes a citizen of the United States when he
                            is 19 and between January 1 and August 31 may have his name removed from
                            the register by applying to the Queen’s commissioner of the province in
                            which he was registered. If he does not have his name removed from the
                            register, or if he becomes a citizen of the United States after the
                            register is closed (August 31) and his name is drawn for enlistment, his
                            naturalization does not affect his military obligations to the
                            Netherlands, and if he returns he is liable (1) to be treated as a
                            deserter if he did not respond to the summons for service, or (2) to be
                            enlisted if he is under 40.</p>
                        <p>Former Netherlands subjects are advised to ascertain by inquiry from the
                            Netherlands authorities what status they may expect to enjoy if they
                            return to the Netherlands. This Department, however, uniformly declines
                            to act as the intermediary in the inquiry.</p>
                        <p>Passports are not required for admission to the Netherlands, but American
                            citizens are advised to carry them for purposes of identification and in
                            attestation of citizenship.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: May I respectfully request from the
                            Department of State instructions in regard to the nationality of Rafael
                            Franklin Hine, 19 years of age, and a native of Costa Rica The young man
                            has been educated in the public and private schools of the Republic, has
                            never visited the United States, and is entirely ignorant of the English
                            language. His father was born in the United States, and came here when
                            23 years old, married a native Costa Rican, and died here after five
                            years’ residence as a practicing physician, leaving this one child and a
                            widow, who has resided here since upon property of which she is the
                            owner.</p>
                        <p>I may state en passant that Mr. Hine, the grandfather of the young man,
                            was at one time United States consul at San José.</p>
                        <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0501"/>
                        <p>Young Mr. Hine now claims exemption from military service here on the
                            ground that he is an American citizen. I have requested of the Costa
                            Rican foreign office that he be excused therefrom until the question of
                            his citizenship has been passed upon by my Government.</p>
                        <p>I do not see how Mr. Hine can consistently claim that it is his intention
                            to hereafter make his home in the United States. He is now engaged in
                            the dairy business in this city.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            dispatch No. 551, of the 18th ultimo, in which you request to be
                            informed as to the nationality of Rafael Franklin Hine, 19 years of age,
                            and a native of Costa Rica, the facts of whose case, as stated by you,
                            are as follows:</p>
                        <p>The young man has been educated in the public and private schools of
                            Costa Rica, has never visited the United States, and is entirely
                            ignorant of the English language. His father was born in the United
                            States, went to Costa Rica when 23 years old, married a native Costa
                            Rican, and died there after five years’ residence as a practicing
                            physician.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hine now claims exemption from military service in Costa Rica on the
                            ground that he is an American citizen.</p>
                        <p>You add that Mr. Hine is engaged in the dairy business in San Jose, and
                            that you do not see how he can consistently claim that it is his
                            intention to make hereafter his home in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Assuming that the father was an American citizen when the son was born,
                            the latter is an American citizen, according to section 1993 of the
                            Revised Statutes of the United States, which provides that a child born
                            outside of the limits of the United States, whose father was at the time
                            of the child’s birth a citizen of the United States, is himself a
                            citizen.</p>
                        <p>Of course, “no sovereignty can extend its jurisdiction beyond its own
                            territorial limits, so as to relieve those born under and subject to
                            another jurisdiction from their obligations or duties thereto.” (Mr.
                            Fish to the President, August 25, 1873, quoted in The American Passport,
                            page 141.) Therefore, as an American citizen, the young man may be
                            granted a passport upon making satisfactory application therefor.</p>
                        <p>How far the right to protect him may be exerted depends to a considerable
                            extent upon the claims that Costa Rica has upon him under her law, upon
                            which point the Department is not advised.</p>
                        <p>The question of his intention to come to this country will be of more
                            consequence when he shall have reached the age of 21 years. Until that
                            time he is not competent to elect expatriation from the United States,
                            and the presumption is in favor of his conservation of the citizenship
                            conferred upon him by his birth as the son of an American citizen.</p>

                        <p>Permission to be naturalized in a foreign country is not granted by the
                            Persian Government to a Persian subject if he is under charge for a

                            from the Persian army, or is in debt in Persia, or fled to avoid
                            pecuniary obligations.</p>
                        <p>If a Persian subject becomes a citizen of another country without the

                            territory, and if he had any property in Persia he is ordered to sell or

                        <p>There is no treaty between the United States and Persia defining the

                            reception held by His Majesty the Shah, at the palace in Teheran, to
                            celebrate his birthday. This is an annual function, and is made the
                            occasion of some pleasant courtesies between the Shah and the
                            representatives of foreign countries.</p>
                        <p>He made inquiries about the President’s health, and told me that he had
                            been given to understand that he was a personage of great ability and
                            force of character. I replied that such was the general opinion.</p>
                        <p>In consequence of the legation being in mourning for the late President,
                            I did not attend the banquet given in the evening by the prime minister,

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have examined the papers which are
                                hereto annexed and I have no doubt that they present a case which
                                will justify a grave demand for redress from the Government of Peru.
                                The facts on which the claim is based may be briefly stated as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p>On July 20, 1885, a force of 16 armed and uniformed men, of the party
                                of General Cáceres, proceeded to Mr. Hay ball’s farm, some 33 miles
                                from the coast, seized that gentleman, and demanded of him 20
                                horses, the same number of rifles, and a large amount of ammunition.
                                He did not possess the rifles or ammunition, and refused to give up
                                his horses, standing on his rights as an American citizen and
                                consular agent at Chimbote. His animals, to the number of 80, were
                                then seized, his store was pillaged, his orchard was laid waste, and
                                he was forced to provide for his captors for the night. Of his
                                animals, all but 28 were afterwards returned to him.</p>
                            <p>On the 4th of August following, 8 more horses were taken from him in
                                a similar manner. On the next day, Mr. Hayball went to Chimbote to
                                complain to the commander of the whole force. He was promised
                                redress, but was made to pay the land tax for the current year,
                                $144. The promise was not fulfilled. On the 15th of November last,
                                Mr. Hayball was compelled to pay the land tax again to the
                                representative of the other party. This time he was assessed $180.
                                These repeated exactions and the seizure of his property have nearly
                                ruined the claimant, and he asks that Peru should make good to him
                                his losses.</p>
                            <p>He further states that during the ten years he has lived at Chimbote
                                he has never had anything to do with the political questions of the
                                country, or violated his neutrality as an American citizen.</p>
                            <p>I therefore respectfully report that our minister at Lima should be
                                called upon to demand from the Government of Peru a suitable
                                redress, both for the insult to this Government in the person of its
                                consular agent and for the personal injuries to the claimant.</p>
                            <p>All of which is respectfully submitted.</p>

                                telegram<note n="a" xml:id="d371fna">Printed ante.</note> I sent the
                            Department on the 26th, instant reporting Peru’s offer of 8,000 soles in
                            settlement of the claim of Mr. James H. Hayball, a citizen of the United
                            States, for loss of property suffered by him during the Cáceres
                            revolution of 1885; and a copy of the Department’s telegram<note n="a"
                                xml:id="d371fnb">Printed ante.</note> of to-day authorizing its
                            acceptance.</p>
                        <p>I also inclose herewith a copy and translation of the note of Dr. Osma,
                            the Peruvian foreign minister, containing the proposal, and a copy of
                            the acceptance I have just sent him.</p>
                        <p>Preliminary to acting upon the foreign minister’s offer I had the
                            claimant come to Lima to give me his views. As often happens in such
                            cases, the valuation of the animals taken and of the damage to his
                            garden proved to have been exaggerated. Placing, at my request, a
                            conservative valuation upon the various items of loss complained of, it
                            appeared from his statement that the total was between 8,000 and 9,000
                            soles. It is to be remarked that the estimate omits from consideration
                            all claim to interest during the years indemnity has been withheld.
                            Nevertheless, the claimant expressed himself as highly pleased with the
                            offer, and I accordingly cabled the message above mentioned. It is
                            pleasant to me to be able to add that the present foreign minister
                            treated the reclamation not only without evasion but with candor and a
                            fairness which is more or less apparent, eliminating the interest
                            question, from the near coincidence of his compromise offer with the
                            claimant’s present estimate.</p>

                                187,<note n="a" xml:id="d373fna">Not printed.</note> of October 24
                            last, transmitting a copy of the certificate of the United States
                            consular agent at Tumbez to affidavits submitted by William Fowks in
                            support of his claim against the Peruvian Government, this certificate
                            having been omitted from the papers previously transmitted. This
                            completes the evidence which the Department, in its instruction of
                            August 27, 1896, indicated should be furnished.</p>
                        <p>The facts in this case, as they appear from the memorial and the
                            affidavits presented in support thereof, are as follows:</p>
                        <p>William Fowks, a native-born American citizen, engaged at Tumbez, Peru,
                            in the mercantile business as a member of the firm of Edward Fowks &amp;
                            Co., was imprisoned December 28, 1894, for twenty-four hours, by the
                            commander of a revolutionary force opposing the regular Government, at
                            the time in possession of the city of Tumbez. The insurgent commander
                            demanded of Mr. Fowks 400 soles for the use of the insurgents. The money
                            was refused, and thereupon the insurgent commander cast Mr. Fowks into
                            prison and kept him there without food, water, or bed, until after the
                            expiration of twenty-four hours, the severity of the treatment
                            compelling Mr. Fowks to comply with the demand made upon him. Fearing
                            further pecuniary exaction, Mr. Fowks, after his release, left Peru and
                            abandoned the mercantile business in which he was engaged for himself
                            and his partners, who were also, according to his statement, citizens of
                            the United States. In 1896, Mr. Fowks presented to the Department a
                            claim asking for the return to him of the 400 soles extorted by the
                            revolutionary commander as above described, also indemnity for his
                            imprisonment and his personal suffering while in prison, and finally,
                            damages to reimburse himself and his partners for the loss sustained by
                            the enforced abandonment of their business in Tumbez.</p>
                        <p>It appears from the sworn statements of Consular Agent Baldini, and the
                            other witnesses, submitted in your dispatch No. 134, of May 28 last,
                            that at the time of the revolution Tumbez was held by the regular
                            Government forces under the command of the Subprefect Munoz, numbering
                            from 30 to 150 men, regular troops; that upon <pb n="431"
                                xml:id="pg_431" facs="0511"/>the approach of the insurgent forces,
                            numbering about 80 men, Munoz abandoned Tumbez. The revolution, which
                            lasted about six months, was successful, and resulted in the
                            establishment of the present Government. From the date of the
                            imprisonment of Fowks until the inauguration of the provisional
                            government, the revolutionary forces occupied Tumbez, the department of
                            Piuria, in which it is located, being in the hands of the Government
                            forces, numbering about 600 men. The commander of the insurgent forces
                            which occupied Tumbez and imprisoned Fowks was Colonel Seminario, a
                            nephew or the present second vice-president of Peru, and a member of the
                            Peruvian Congress. The insurgents had not been recognized by this
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Article 15 of the treaty of 1887 between the United States and Peru,
                            which was in force at the time of the occurrence above recited, contains
                            the following provision: “The high contracting parties promise and
                            engage to give full and perfect protection to the persons and property
                            of the citizens of each other of all classes and occupations who may be
                            dwelling or transient in the territories subject to their respective
                            jurisdiction;” also, “that the citizens of one contracting party within
                            the territory of the other shall not be liable to imprisonment without
                            formal commitment under a warrant signed by a legal authority, except
                            incases flagrantis delicti.” Also, “said citizens, when detained in
                            prison, shall be treated during their imprisonment with humanity, and no
                            unnecessary severity shall be exercised toward them.” Article 2 of the
                            same treaty provides that “they (said citizens) shall not be called upon
                            for any forced loan or extraordinary contribution for any military
                            expedition * * * without being allowed therefor a full and sufficient
                            indemnification, which shall be in all cases agreed upon and paid in
                            advance.”</p>
                        <p>For the treatment to which Mr. Fowks was subjected, in violation of
                            express provisions of treaty and of the principles of international law,
                            the Peruvian Government is responsible (see the correspondence in the
                            MacCord case, to which you have access). You are accordingly instructed
                            to present a claim in behalf of Mr. Fowks for reimbursement of the money
                            extorted from him, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum
                            from December 28, 1894, and for a reasonable indemnity—say $5,000—for
                            the imprisonment and ill-treatment.</p>
                        <p>In the opinion of the Department the claim for damages for interruption
                            of the business of Fowks &amp; Co. is not a valid one, and you will not
                            present the same.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that I have
                            to-day received from the Peruvian Government its draft for 3,000 soles
                            in settlement of the claim of Mr. William Fowks, a citizen of the United
                            States, who suffered at the hands of revolutionists at Tumbez, Peru, in
                            December, 1894. The claimant left Peru several months ago to accept an
                            employment at Pittsburg. Before going he gave to his father, Mr. Edward
                            Fowks of Paita, a general power of attorney to act for him in securing
                            settlement of the claim. The power, duly executed before a notary public
                            and witnesses at Paita, and there recorded, was deposited at this
                            legation by the senior Mr. Fowks while in Lima several weeks ago. The
                            amount of the collection, therefore, will be transferred to him as the
                            claimant’s authorized representative, and his receipt therefor forwarded
                            in due course to the Department.</p>
                        <p>The Peruvian foreign minister made his offer of settlement on the 16th
                            ultimo at the last of a number of conferences I had had with him upon
                            the subject.</p>
                        <p>The amount of the contribution extorted from the claimant was the
                            equivalent of about $200, so that the indemnity paid on account of his
                            imprisonment for twenty-four hours under the circumstances of
                            aggravation detailed in his memorial is about $1,300. He was one of a
                            number upon whom small contributions were levied at the same time and
                            place. His case, as I have learned verbally from his father, differs
                            from the others in that he did not, like them, deliver upon demand; but,
                            attentive to word sent him by his father in anticipation of the action
                            of the revolutionists, stood upon his rights until he had reached the
                            limit of physical endurance under the coercion employed.</p>
                        <p>On the whole, I believe that the principle herein involved, classifying
                            the case as a lesser MacCord claim, has been again vindicated, and, in
                            my telegram to you, I did not hesitate to pronounce in favor of the
                            fairness of the settlement, which I regard as a friendly manifestation
                            from this Government as well as an act of justice.</p>

                                claim, or performing any act which might serve to establish a
                                precedent either for or against analogous cases, I beg to submit to
                                your excellency the following arrangement of this question:</p>
                            <p>To pay to the claimant, Mr. Fowks, the sum of 3,000 soles silver, in
                                virtue of which payment his claim will become totally and definitely
                                canceled, not only as regards the ill-treatment and imprisonment
                                which he declares having suffered at the hands of the forces which
                                occupied Tumbez under the orders of Col. Felipe Seminario, but also
                                as regards the forced loan of 400 soles, the repayment of which with
                                interest has been solicited by the claimant.</p>
                            <p>I trust that your excellency’s Government will not fail to see in the
                                preceding proposal a new proof of the interest taken by the
                                Government of Peru in its endeavors to contribute toward the
                                maintenance of the cordial relations now existing between Peru and
                                the United States of America, and I have the honor to reiterate,

                            <p>In addition to the petition made to your excellency on the 22d of
                                October, 1900, I have the honor to say that I am requested by the
                                firm J. C. Ayer &amp; Co. to state that they have no objection to
                                show the formula of their Sarsaparilla, which is not a patent
                                medicine, but approved of by all medical men.</p>
                            <p>The composition of Pink Pills was made known to the “Conselho de
                                Sande e Hygiene,” but not to the public. The three medicines which
                                the firm in question now begs permission to offer for sale are,
                                then, the following: First, Sarsaparilla; second, Cherry Pectoral;
                                third, Ague Cure.</p>
                            <p>These three medicines have been admitted for sale by all nations, and
                                the Sarsaparilla has the largest sale of any medicine in the
                                world.</p>
                            <p>Requesting of your excellency the favor of a speedy decision in this
                                matter, I avail, etc.,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: We beg to acknowledge the receipt of
                                your favor of the 13th instant, advising that before the
                                Department’s instructions of the 23d ultimo reached the United
                                States chargé d’affaires at Lisbon the Portuguese authorities had,
                                according to the chargé’s statement, refused a market for our
                                medicines. We are in receipt of advices to the same effect from our
                                resident agents.</p>
                            <p>We have to thank you most sincerely for your many kindnesses in this
                                matter, and trust you will pardon us if we trespass on your
                                attention a little further as follows:</p>
                            <p>Our preparations affected by this arbitrary decision of the
                                Portuguese authorities are Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral and Ayer’s
                                Sarsaparilla. These medicines have been, sold in Portugal for fully
                                thirty years. During this time a large demand has been created, the
                                medicines having been recommended by a large number of Portuguese
                                physicians and medical men, and they have gained considerable
                                acceptance among the Portuguese people. It is, therefore, a serious
                                blow to our business in Portugal to have these goods shut out of the
                                market there at this late date.</p>
                            <p>Our resident agents at Oporto, Messrs. James Cassels &amp; Co.,
                                inform us that the reason given by the council of health for
                                refusing their approval of Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral and Ayer’s
                                Sarsaparilla is that they are secret medicines. This is not true.
                                The formulas are always available to the members of the medical
                                profession, to whom same are freely sent on application. Messrs.
                                James Cassels &amp; Co. further report to us that in November, 1899,
                                “Dr. Williams’s Pink Pills,” a British preparation, was not approved
                                of by the council of health of Lisbon, but the British minister
                                requested that it should be approved of, and the Portuguese
                                Government ordered the council of health to reconsider their
                                decision, with the result that “Dr. Williams’s Pink Pills” received
                                approval, although the formula is actually kept a secret.</p>
                            <p>Messrs. Cassels &amp; Co. say that if the United States minister at
                                Lisbon were politely, but firmly, to request the Portuguese
                                Government to approve of our medicines, stating the fact of their
                                having been sold for so many years in Portugal, and of their being
                                recommended by a large number of Portuguese medical men, and that
                                our medicines are not secret medicines, the formulas being supplied
                                to medical men on application therefor, then, even now, it is
                                probable that the Portuguese Government would ask the council of
                                health to reconsider their decision.</p>
                            <p>If we may trespass on your kindness to this extent we shall esteem it
                                a great favor; and hoping that you will instruct our minister at
                                Lisbon in accordance with the above,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: We had the honor of addressing you on
                                the 15th instant in the matter of our preparations in Portugal, and
                                to-day are in receipt of your esteemed favor of the 14th, covering
                                copy of a note addressed to the United States legation at Lisbon by
                                the Portuguese foreign office stating that permission has been
                                denied for the sale of Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, Ayer’s Sarsaparilla,
                                and Ayer’s Ague Cure. In this note is not stated the ground on which
                                the permission has been denied, but our resident agents at Oporto
                                inform us that the decision has been made on the ground that the
                                preparations in question are “secret” medicines. As stated in our
                                respects to you of the 15th instant, this is not true.</p>
                            <p>In any event the decision is a most arbitrary one and has no just
                                basis, the motive therefor being, in fact, the desire of the
                                Portuguese native manufacturers to prevent the importation and
                                competition of American medicines.</p>
                            <p>The exclusion of our Ague Cure is of small moment, as we have made no
                                particular demand in Portugal for that medicine, but we beg that you
                                will be kind enough to exert your influence in favor of a reversal
                                of the decision of the Portuguese ministers in so far as the same

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: We regret exceedingly to learn from
                                Messrs. James Cassels &amp; Co., our resident agents at Oporto, that
                                in the Diario do Governo of 20th ultimo notice was given that Ayer’s
                                Sarsaparilla, Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, and Ayer’s Ague Cure had not
                                been approved of by the conselho de saude because they were secret
                                medicines. This announcement is a strong disappointment to us, as we
                                had confidently anticipated, despite the long delay on the part of
                                the Portuguese authorities in considering the case, that a favorable
                                decision would be given. On the 27th ultimo we were advised by the
                                Secretary of State at Washington that cable instructions had been
                                again sent requesting you to use your influence to obtain the
                                authorization of our medicines. We beg that, despite the notice
                                referred to in the Diario do Governo, you will urgently insist that
                                the Portuguese Government shall approve of our Cherry Pectoral and
                                Sarsaparilla (the Ague Cure is not of so much importance), on the
                                ground that they have been approved of elsewhere; that they are
                                recommended by very many Portuguese physicians and medical men; and
                                particularly that these medicines are not secret medicines, because
                                the formulas are sent to all medical men requesting same. In fact,
                                we have no objection whatever to the publication of our formulas,
                                and our medicines can not properly be classed as secret
                                medicines.</p>
                            <p>We are informed that Williams’s Pink Pills, a British preparation,
                                had not met with the approval of the conselho de saude, but the
                                British minister used his <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0518"
                                />influence in favor of their approval with the result that the
                                Portuguese Government ordered the conselho de saude to reconsider
                                its decision, and the outcome was that Dr. Williams’s Pink Pills
                                finally received the approval of the conselho de saude, despite the
                                fact that the formula of this medicine is actually kept a
                                secret.</p>
                            <p>We have invested large capital and have expended much energy in
                                establishing our business in Portugal, which has been in existence
                                now for some thirty years. It is, therefore, a great injury to our
                                interests to come under the ban of the conselho de saude in this
                                arbitrary fashion, and we sincerely hope that you will oblige us by
                                acting as strongly in the matter as may be possible.</p>
                            <p>Thanking you in anticipation,</p>
                            <p>We have, etc.,</p>

                        <p>The information given below is believed to be correct, yet is not to be
                            considered as official, as it relates to the laws and regulations of a
                            foreign country.</p>
                        <p>Military service is obligatory upon Portuguese male subjects, but by
                            becoming naturalized in a foreign country a Portuguese loses his
                            qualifications as such.</p>
                        <p>On returning to the Kingdom with the intention of residing in it he may
                            reacquire Portuguese subjection by requesting it from the municipal
                            authorities of the place he selects for his residence. Not making this
                            declaration he remains an alien and is not subject to military duty.</p>
                        <p>If a Portuguese leaves Portugal without having performed the military
                            duty to which he was liable and becomes naturalized in a foreign
                            country, his property is subject to seizure, and that of the person who
                            may have become security for him when he left the Kingdom is equally
                            liable. There is no treaty between the United States and Portugal
                            defining the status of former Portuguese subjects who have become
                            naturalized American citizens.</p>
                        <p>Passports are not required to enter Portuguese dominions. Travelers are,
                            however, required to establish their nationality when they depart, and
                            for this purpose a passport is the most effective document.</p>

                            of a letter, without date, from Mrs. Louisa Lassonne, who wishes a
                            renewal of her passport, and to request the ruling of the Department
                            upon the case.</p>
                        <p>This is a case where the lady, the widow of a naturalized American
                            citizen, confesses to having no identity with the United States or
                            purpose of going there. Upon the other hand, she pleads inability to go,
                            from poverty and the infirmities of age; but it does not appear that the
                            necessity of her stay abroad has arisen from any vocation such as the
                            Department usually accepts as sufficient ground for protracted absence.
                            The case is a sympathetic one, but I feel that I can not accede to her
                            application without special authority to do so.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I heard from Mr. Billhardt, the

                                on the plea that you wish to know a little more about me.</p>
                            <p>Well, I, Mrs. Louisa Lassonne, a native of Switzerland, born in
                                Vevey, Canton de Vaud, was married in the year 1874, on the 9th of
                                May, to Mr. Charles Lassonne, a naturalized citizen of the United
                                States of America, at St. Petersburg, at the United States legation,
                                by R. I. Hall, in the presence of Marshal Jewell, then ambassador of
                                the said legation.</p>
                            <p>I am an old woman, weak and sickly, a widow; I earn my bread by
                                teaching; in the winter I give lessons, in the summer I travel about
                                with families at whom I engage as governess.</p>
                            <p>I never was in America, and can not go there if I wished, having no
                                means; and what should I do there, I being a stranger, rather to
                                say, foreign to the country; in which way could I get my existence;
                                and should I say it frankly, I thought that I had a right to the aid
                                and protection from the country I became a citizen by legal rights,
                                and instead of that I am refused a passport. I ask for it lawfully,
                                by appellation, as I have been told to do by Mr. Billhardt. I will
                                hope, sir, that after this explanation you will not refuse to issue
                                me a passport; if in a contrary case, please teach me what I have to
                                do in future.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your No. 489, of the 23d ultimo, in
                            relation to the application of Mrs. Louisa Lassonne for a passport, has
                            been received. From the statement of your dispatch and Mrs. Lassonne’s
                            letter it appears that the applicant, being a native of Switzerland, was
                            married in St. Petersburg in 1874 to Mr. Charles Lassonne, stated to be
                            a naturalized citizen of the United States. She is now a widow. She has
                            never been in the United States and has no apparent intention of coming
                            hither.</p>
                        <p>No question appears to be raised as to the nationality of the applicant’s
                            late husband, and it is presumed that you have satisfied yourself that
                            he was a duly naturalized citizen. The only question for the Department
                            to consider is whether, under the circumstances, Mrs. Lassonne is
                            entitled to protection as a citizen of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Lassonne’s claim can, of course, be no better than her husband’s
                            would be were he alive; and it would seem that at some time in or prior
                            to 1874 he virtually abandoned his American residence for a European
                            domicile. The widow’s case is even weaker, for, during nearly a quarter
                            of a century since her marriage, she has never enjoyed an American
                            domicile.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, a somewhat peculiar aspect exists in this case. By our statute
                            an alien wife of an American citizen shares his citizenship. By the
                            usual rules of continental private international law a woman marrying an
                            alien shares his status, certainly during his life; but thereafter on
                            widowhood reverts to her original status unless she abandons the country
                            of her origin and returns to that of her late husband. Were Mrs.
                            Lassonne now sojourning in Switzerland, it would probably be claimed
                            that she had on widowhood reverted to her character as a Switzer; and
                            the converse claim that she had become a citizen of the United States by
                            operation of the laws of the United States, without ever having been
                            within their jurisdiction, would probably be contested by Switzerland.
                            As the lady, however, is not in her native country, but in a third
                            state, this point is not material to the question whether she is or is
                            not entitled to protection as an American citizen. It is merely
                            mentioned by way of suggestion that, as she is certainly not a Russian
                            so far as appears and is not entitled to protection as an American
                            citizen, her Swiss character may be found to remain intact, entitling
                            her to a Swiss passport.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s conclusion is that it can not authorize you to grant
                            Mrs. Lassonne a passport upon the facts as stated by you.</p>

                            copy of a letter, dated at Moscow the 21st of October, 1901, from Mrs.
                            Louisa Lassonne, who seeks an American passport for identification and
                            protection in Russia.</p>
                        <p>It appears that Mrs. Lassonne was born in Switzerland, in the Canton de
                            Vaud, and that she is now a widow. She was married in 1874 <pb n="444"
                                xml:id="pg_444" facs="0524"/>to Charles Lassonne, a naturalized
                            citizen, with whom she lived in Moscow until his death some years
                            ago.</p>
                        <p>She applied to the United States legation in St. Petersburg for a
                            passport in 1897, and her application was submitted to the Department of
                            State by the Hon. Clifton R. Breckinridge in his dispatch No. 489, of
                            the 23d of February of that year.</p>
                        <p>The decision of the honorable Secretary of State, given in Mr. Sherman’s
                            dispatch No. 379, of the 15th of March, 1897, was that the application
                            of Mrs. Lassonne could not be granted, and an American passport could
                            not be issued to her because, as her husband had died and she had never
                            been in America, she was held to have lost the American citizenship
                            acquired by her in her marriage with him.</p>
                        <p>The honorable Secretary expressed his decision as follows: <quote

                                    States by operation of the laws of the United States, without
                                    ever having been within their jurisdiction, would probably be
                                    contested by Switzerland. As the lady, however, is not in her
                                    native country, but in a third state, this point is not material
                                    to the question whether she is or is not entitled to protection
                                    as an American citizen. It is merely mentioned by way of
                                    suggestion that, as she is certainly not a Russian so far as
                                    appears and is not entitled to protection as an American

                                    entitling her to a Swiss passport.</p>
                                <p>The Department’s conclusion is that it can not authorize you to

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The only new matter presented by Mrs. Lassonne in her present appeal,
                            which I have the honor to lay before you, is the decision of the Swiss
                            Federal Council, a copy of which is hereto attached, that she lost her
                            Swiss citizenship by her marriage with a foreigner, and that she can not
                            resume her original nationality upon the death of her husband. Therefore
                            she asks to be recognized as an American.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Lassonne, who is 54 years of age, supports herself in Moscow by
                            teaching. She is too poor to go either to America or to Switzerland, and
                            she has sent me a certificate issued by Dr. Kramoreff, of Moscow,
                            declaring that she is physically too weak to travel far. A copy of that
                            certificate is also hereto attached.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The first thing I will do is to beg
                                pardon for intruding upon you, but I feel duty bound to let you know
                                what my next step will be concerning my claims to an American
                                passport. You have returned the papers sent you through our United
                                States consul resident in Moscow, Mr. Smith, saying that you could
                                not issue a new passport to me, as the same had been refused to me
                                four years ago.</p>
                            <p>Well, sir, allow me to explain my circumstances to you: In 1874, at
                                the legation of the United States at St. Petersburg, I was married
                                to Mr. Charles Lassonne, a citizen of the United States of America,
                                city and county of New York. My husband had at the time a temporary
                                domicile in Moscow, and never had the intention of remaining here in
                                this country, but he got ill, and during many years has been ailing,
                                incapable of earning anything, or working to maintain wile or
                                family. I had to work to keep <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445"
                                    facs="0525"/>him. All these facts I can prove by witnesses,
                                certificates, records of hospitals, etc.; even the Rev. Henry
                                Bernard, former chaplain of the British church in Moscow, could
                                certify the truth of my assertions. When my husband died his papers
                                were sent to Washington. I had my own passport delivered to me at
                                the embassy in Constantinople. As the new American law came out I
                                was told that the passports were issued only for the term of two
                                years. I immediately made an application to the minister in St.
                                Petersburg and I received my document. I changed it again when the
                                time came; and four years ago what was my astonishment to learn that
                                my passport had been kept by the minister and a new one refused to
                                me, under the plea that my husband having willfully abandoned his
                                American residence, I, his widow, had lost my right to an American
                                passport, being no longer a citizen, and that according to a certain
                                international law that should exist (sic) any European woman married
                                to an American lost her rights at his death and became what she was
                                before—that is to say, for me, a <hi rend="italic">Swiss
                                    citizen</hi>. Well, sir, I took a Swiss advocate, Mr. Magnin, in
                                Geneva, sent all my papers to him. He submitted them to the American
                                consul in Geneva, who said about the same thing to him. Then Mr.
                                Magnin, acting for me, applied first to the cantonal council, then
                                to the Federal Council of Switzerland, and you will find inclosed a
                                copy of the decision of both councils. So, now, sir, I would like to
                                know what I am. The American minister says I am a Swiss; the Swiss
                                Government says I am an American by marriage. Mr. Breckinridge sends
                                me to America to fulfill my duties as an American citizen. Sir, I am
                                an old woman, a great invalid; here I send you the certificate of my
                                physician; I can not undertake such a voyage, and if I were to break
                                my home, my connections, my livelihood to start a new life, should I
                                land there to go to the workhouse?</p>
                            <p>I have said all; now remains me to ask you, sir, to take my state
                                into consideration, to grant me that paper, as it is the only means
                                of living quiet the few days that are left to me. Should you find it
                                impossible to grant me my requirement I will write to Mr. John Hay,
                                in Washington, and lay the whole case before him. You must see, sir,
                                that I suffer through the incapacity of some officials.</p>
                            <p>With best respect, etc.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            No. 499, of the 20th ultimo, inclosing copy of a letter from Mrs. L.
                            Lassonne, appealing for a United States passport.</p>
                        <p>You refer to the Department’s No. 379, of March 15, 1897, to Mr.
                            Breckinridge, in which the Department declined to issue a passport to
                            Mrs. Lassonne.</p>
                        <p>The opinion of the Department that Mrs. Lassonne was not entitled to a
                            passport was not based on the hypothesis that she would be claimed as a
                            Swiss citizen by Switzerland. This was merely mentioned as a suggestion
                            that she might possibly secure a Swiss passport. The decision of the
                            Department was based upon her abandonment of the citizenship which she
                            acquired by her marriage to a citizen of the United States.</p>
                        <p>I quote from the instruction: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>It appears that the applicant, being a native of Switzerland, was
                                    married in St. Petersburg in 1874 to Mr. Charles Lassonne. * * *
                                    She is now a widow. She has never been in the United States, and
                                    has no apparent intention of coming hither. * * * The only
                                    question for the Department to consider is whether, under the
                                    circumstances, Mrs. Lassonne is entitled to protection as a
                                    citizen of the United States. Mrs. Lassonne’s claim can, of
                                    course, be no better than her husband’s would be, were he alive;
                                    and it would seem that at some time in or prior to 1874 he
                                    virtually abandoned his American residence for a European
                                    domicile. The widow’s case is even weaker, for, during nearly a
                                    quarter of a century since her marriage, she has never enjoyed
                                    an American domicile.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>While the Department’s sympathies are with Mrs. Lassonne, it thinks that
                            she is not entitled to a passport as an American citizen.</p>

                            recently come to Russia and now asks this embassy to secure for him the
                            privilege of remaining here for an indefinite time.</p>
                        <p>The subject of this gentleman’s request was brought to my attention by
                            the United States consul at Riga, a copy of whose letter, dated the 3d

                        <p>This Mr. Margolin is an Austrian by birth, 32 years of age, who emigrated
                            to the United States in 1895, and was naturalized before the district
                            court of the United States for the southern district of New York, on the

                                xml:id="pg_447" facs="0527"/>with business houses of influence.” As
                            he is a Jew, however, he has been granted a limited permit, which as you
                            well know is required under the provisions of the Russian law, by which
                            he is authorized to reside within the Empire for three months. But not
                            content with this, he calls upon this embassy to exert the influence of
                            the United States Government in his behalf to the end that he may secure
                            “permission to stop in this country as long as my passport.” The
                            passport which he presents is dated at Berlin the 1st day of November,
                            1900, and was issued there by the Hon. Andrew D. White, United States
                            ambassador.</p>
                        <p>Upon the receipt of this communication through Mr. Bornholdt, United
                            States consul, I replied that I should require some further details as
                            to Mr. Margolin’s origin and nationality before I could take up his
                            case, and that I wished to know more clearly what his connection is with
                            America and upon what ground he calls upon the Government of the United
                            States to serve him.</p>
                        <p>Thereupon Mr. Margolin wrote me the letter of the 17th of December, from
                            Whitebsk, which forms part of the correspondence hereto attached.</p>
                        <p>It appears from the details which I have been able to obtain that this
                            man was naturalized only last October and left America at once, for we
                            find him already in Berlin equipped with an American passport on the 1st
                            day of November. He has no interest in the United States that I can
                            discover; he has never paid any tax there; has never served upon a jury.
                            In fine, he has rendered no service of any kind to the country.</p>
                        <p>Immediately upon coming to Europe, however, he seeks to employ his newly
                            acquired citizenship, not for protection against personal injury, but
                            for the acquirement of <hi rend="italic">privilege</hi> in the
                            furtherance of his own aims.</p>
                        <p>In order to ascertain definitely whether Mr. Margolin intends in good
                            faith to return to the United States and perform there his duties as an
                            American citizen or not, I wrote to him on the 2d of January asking him
                            whether he wished a permit to live in Russia for two years, the period
                            for which he holds his present American passport, and whether he sought
                            also to remain here permanently.</p>
                        <p>By his reply, dated the 6th of January, to which I have the honor to
                            refer you, he informs me that he intends to live permanently in Russia
                            if the Imperial authorities will allow him to do so.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing to show that this man had any interest in becoming an
                            American citizen beyond the purpose of using the advantages of
                            citizenship in order to obtain privileges abroad which certainly would
                            not have been asked for in his behalf by his own representatives if he
                            had come to Russia directly from the country of his origin. Nor is it
                            unreasonable, from his own presentation of the case, to assume that he
                            has already substantially abandoned his duties and obligations as an
                            American citizen.</p>
                        <p>It is true, he declares in his letter to me of the 17th of December, “I
                            expect by importing different American novelties exclusively for Russia
                            to approve as well with the interest of my country as I think it will
                            provide convenient for my share.” A statement which I incline to regard
                            rather as an appeal to sentiment than an indication of a serious purpose
                            to develop American industry. And I have not been willing to comply with
                            Mr. Margolin’s request because, if we have on <pb n="448"
                                xml:id="pg_448" facs="0528"/>the one hand his unsupported
                            declaration that he intends to introduce American wares into Russia, I
                            respectfully submit that we have on the other a plain attempt to abuse
                            an American certificate of naturalization.</p>

                                a period of three months on account of his being of Hebrew

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Margolin, concerning whom you will
                                receive simultaneously an official letter from this consulate,
                                referred to a similar case, which, he asserted had taken place some
                                time ago.</p>
                            <p>In this case, he said, the permission (to stay in Russia) had at
                                first been refused by the Imperial Government, but had been granted
                                later on, in consequence of a direct appeal from the Hebrew in
                                question to United States President.</p>
                            <p>You are of course the best judge concerning the attention which this

                                while there, when he left there. Ask him also to state whether he
                                pays any taxes in the United States; and if so, how much and where.
                                I wish further to know whether he has ever served upon a jury there;
                                and in general what American interest he may have, if any, to

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: A few days ago I received
                                a letter from the United States consul at Riga, where I applied for
                                kind assistance to protect my sojourn in Russia as an American
                                citizen, with the instruction to furnish the embassy on the direct
                                way with some further details in regard to my person. I hereby take
                                the liberty to comply with the order of the consul, and I venture to
                                hope that the honorable embassy will convey my petition. The origin
                                of my country is Austria, and I was born on the 10th of October,
                                1868, at Stanislau, Austria, of Jewish parentage. After finishing
                                different colleges of education in Austria and Germany, I went to
                                New York with the purpose of entering a business career. I landed in
                                New York on the 4th day of January, 1895, and lived there all the
                                time until October 4, 1900, when I sailed for Europe. I was employed
                                there for several years in prominent commercial houses as a
                                bookkeeper. After acquiring some of the important methods how to
                                transact and own business, and possessing partly the American
                                language, I represented in partnership with another gentleman under
                                our own firm a large concern in “American novelties” for the State
                                of New York. Finally I was engaged in the real estate and insurance
                                business for myself until my departure with a success capable of
                                being named. I have never been taxed there and I have never served
                                upon a jury. My intention and good will are to stay a citizen of the
                                United States. Under the circumstances that I have a great number of
                                relations in Russia and which are well connected with business
                                houses of influence, I expect, by importing different American
                                novelties exclusively for Russia, to approve as well with the
                                interests of my country, as I think it will provide convenient for
                                my share. Therefore I request of the highly esteemed embassy to
                                secure for me the permission to stop in this country at least as
                                long as my passport, which I presume was sent to the embassy with my
                                citizen paper by the consul at Riga, is entitled to his rights.
                                Trusting that my petition will find a a favorable assistance with
                                the honorable embassy, I have, etc.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: I have received your
                                letter of January 2, with which your excellency had the kindness to
                                honor me, and I hasten to submit to your excellency an obedient
                                reply. It will deign perfectly to my satisfaction if your excellency
                                shall favor me with the grace to secure for me a permit to reside as
                                long as my passport, as issued by the esteemed embassy of the United
                                States at Berlin for two years, is current. In case my enterprises
                                should exhibit a favorable result, in every respect, I would prefer,
                                if possible, having the privilege of renewing your excellency’s, for
                                me, kind obtained permit, together with my passport, after its
                                expiration. I presume that to secure a permanent residence in Russia
                                will be connected with many difficulties, therefore I have decided
                                to aim at that idea. Finally, I take the liberty of mentioning the
                                fact that the permission of my sojourn in Russia, originally granted
                                to me by the Russian minister, as your excellency will kindly notice
                                of my passport, will soon lose its validity, in consequence of which
                                I hereby request of your excellency to relieve my case, to your
                                excellency’s earliest convenience, with an affirmative success.</p>

                                obtain a permit to remain in Russia at least for two years, and, if

                                lived in the United States barely long enough to become a citizen;
                                that you never performed any service there whatever, or paid any

                                your certificate of naturalization, you are not likely to be looked
                                upon as one in a position to call upon the United States Government

                            the penal institutions of Siberia have not been considered either just
                            or fair by the Russians themselves, and his presence here has not been
                            looked upon with favor by the official community of the Empire.</p>
                        <p>Although Mr. Kennan reported himself to the police authorities of St.
                            Petersburg upon his arrival here, as all travelers are required by law
                            to do, he has not been disturbed until now. He has been treated with
                            entire courtesy and consideration; though, having voluntarily placed
                            himself within the jurisdiction of the Russian law, he has become, as he
                            himself admits, amenable to its provisions and is consequently ordered
                            beyond the frontier.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kennan wrote to me last evening as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    Volume II of the laws of the Empire, I, as an “untrustworthy”
                                    American citizen am to be sent out of the country by the train
                                    leaving here for Germany at 10.30 to-morrow night. Meanwhile I
                                    am under close arrest in my room.</p>
                                <p>Of course they are acting within their right, and I have no
                                    complaint whatever to make, nor do I ask any interposition on
                                    the part of the embassy.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Mr. Kennan requested that Mr. Morgan, secretary of this embassy, should
                            go to him to assist in having some books packed which he could not carry
                            in his trunk. At my request Mr. Morgan called upon Mr. Kennan yesterday
                            to ask whether he was in need of any assistance. Mr. Kennan replied that
                            he had nothing to ask for, and that he met with politeness from all the
                            officials of the Imperial police. He left St. Petersburg last evening at
                            10.30 o’clock.</p>
                        <p>The chapter 313 of Volume II of the Russian law, under which this
                            expulsion has taken place, reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                <p>Foreigners who have come into Russia with passports may be
                                    expelled from the Empire only upon the decision of a court of

                                <p>Those foreigners whose behavior is suspicious and those who are
                                    not desirable as residents within the Empire may be expelled by

                                with regard to the shipment of some (perfectly innocent) Russian
                                books, which, owing to my arrest, I can’t get packed. I shouldn’t
                                put him to so much trouble if I could help it, but I presume I shall
                                not be allowed to see any other person.</p>
                            <p>I shall go directly through to London, and will advise you by

                        <p>The information given below is believed to be correct, yet is not to be
                            considered as official, as it relates to the laws and regulations of a
                            foreign country.</p>
                        <p>A Russian is enrolled for military service at the beginning of the
                            twenty-first year of his age, and remains on the rolls to the end of his
                            forty-third year; but at the age of 15 he is considered to be among
                            those who are liable to perform military service, and he can not, after
                            reaching that age, ask for permission to become a citizen of a foreign
                            country, unless he has performed his military service. A Russian who
                            becomes a citizen of another country without Imperial consent is liable
                            under Russian law to the loss of all his civil rights and to perpetual
                            banishment from the Empire. If he returns he is liable to deportation to
                            Siberia. When a Russian emigrates before he is 15 years old, and
                            subsequently becomes a citizen of another country, he is equally liable
                            to punishment, unless when he attained the age of 21 years he took steps
                            necessary to obtain the consent of the Emperor to his expatriation.</p>
                        <p>Naturalized Americans of Russian birth, of the Jewish race, are not
                            allowed to enter Russia except by special permission. For this, they may
                            apply to the minister of the interior, but the Department can not act as
                            intermediary in making the application.</p>
                        <p>There is no treaty between the United States and Russia defining the
                            status of American citizens of Russian birth upon their return to
                            Russia.</p>
                        <p>No one is admitted to Russia without a passport. It must be visaed by a
                            Russian diplomatic or consular representative. Upon entering Russia it
                            should be shown at the first Government house, and the holder will be
                            given another passport or permit of sojourn. At least twenty-four hours
                            before departure from Russia this permit should be presented and a
                            passport of departure will be granted and the original passport
                            returned. A fresh permit to remain in Russia must be obtained every six
                            months.</p>

                            accorded a special audience to-day by King Alexander, upon which
                            occasion His Majesty presented me to Her Majesty, Queen Draga. They both
                            declared in strongest terms their horror at the murder of President
                            McKinley and their sympathy for the American people in the great loss
                            they have sustained by the death of a chief so wise and so good. Their
                            majesties inquired particularly about Mrs. McKinley, and expressed for
                            her the tenderest solicitude. King Alexander was evidently much
                            gratified when I informed him that I had been requested by my Government
                            in a cable dispatch received last evening to convey to His Majesty Mrs.
                            McKinley’s sincerest appreciation of his message of condolence.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of Department instruction No. 244,<note n="a" xml:id="d404fna"
                                >Printed <ref target="frus1900#pg_893">Foreign Relations, 1900, p.
                                    893</ref>.</note> bearing date November 9, and containing the
                            reading of cablegrams exchanged between this legation and the Department
                            on the subject of evidences of citizenship presented by natives of Cuba,
                            Porto Rico, and the Philippine Islands.</p>
                        <p>While the final sentence of the instruction does not seem to be entirely
                            in accord with the telegrams, so specific, which preceded that
                            instruction upon the same subject, I have presumed that it was not
                            intended to repeal or modify the purport of those telegrams, and have
                            not, therefore, in any way informed the consular officers in this
                            country of any instruction later than that of your telegram.</p>
                        <p>The importance of this subject and the complications continually arising,
                            both at this legation, at our various consular offices, and in the
                            Government of Spain itself, leads me to lay before you as clearly as
                            possible the problems presented. I do this also at the suggestion of
                            more than one consular officer in Spain, who are of opinion that the
                            Department may not be exactly advised of the details of the system
                            recognized in your circular letter of May 2, 1899, and the changes that
                            have been made, either by the authority of the War Department or of the
                            provisional authorities, in the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico since the
                            date of that circular letter.</p>
                        <p>The theory, as it has been gathered by all the consular officers to whom
                            it has been sent, as well as this legation, on which was based that
                            instruction, was that the “cedula de vecindad” presented by natives of
                            these islands, would be one issued by the authority in these islands.
                            That, of course, was the case on my first arrival, and that equally, of
                            course, by lapse of time has ceased to be the case at present. The
                            “cedula de vecindad,” under Spanish law which heretofore governed in all
                            her colonies and still remains the law in Spain, is that a cedula of
                            this character must be applied for by every citizen or native, of either
                            the home country or of the colony, in which the applicant was resident
                            at the time of the expiration of his former cedula. These papers have
                            been and are issued for one year only, and the Spanish law has been
                            quite severe, apparently, in punishing, both by fine and by indirect
                            legal consequences, the failure to procure a new one at the end of the
                            life of the old one.</p>
                        <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0538"/>
                        <p>During the first few months of my stay there were presented to me for
                            visé and registration, pursuant to your circular letter of May 2, 1899,
                            only cedulas issued by what purported to be the competent authority in
                            Cuba and in Porto Rico. Sometimes these persons presented also their
                            birth certificate as the best identification, or had presumably done so
                            at the time of granting the original cedula; and all subsequent cedulas
                            were granted, as in our own passport system, on the presentation and
                            surrender of the former. At divers times these cedulas were presented,
                            in some cases without the addition of further evidence, and in some
                            cases together with other evidence, after the lapse of one year from
                            their date. In all these cases I have endeavored to exercise my best
                            judgment to carry out the instruction of the Department to exercise the
                            good offices of the legation for the protection of bona fide applicants,
                            and refused to register or visé cedulas expired already, except where
                            they were accompanied by satisfactory evidence of some other kind. The
                            excuse was universally made by these people, and I have no doubt
                            generally with entire accuracy, that this was all the cedula they could
                            have, as they had been absent more than a year from Cuba or Porto Rico,
                            as the case might be.</p>
                        <p>After the lapse of a few months the applications began to come in to
                            register and certify cedulas issued to persons described as natives of
                            Cuba or Porto Rico, but issued here in Spain by the competent authority,
                            which, generally speaking, are the municipal authorities of the various
                            wards of a city like Madrid, the mayor of smaller cities, or the civil
                            administration of provinces. I never have seen any cedula or other
                            certificate of any kind issued to such people by any bureau or official
                            of the Spanish General Government.</p>
                        <p>I at first declined to recognize these, and even after I consented to
                            allow them to be registered and noted I have always insisted on the
                            production of other evidence, either written or oral, as to the real
                            nativity of the applicant. The pressure was always brought to me that
                            the applicant desiring to go either to Cuba or to Porto Rico had been or
                            would be refused passage on any Spanish steamer without the visa of the
                            cedula by some officer of the Government of the United States authorized
                            for that purpose. I refused to believe this, as I could not understand
                            why any paper issued by any authority of the Spanish Government in Spain
                            should require the certification of the officer of any other
                            nationality; but I was personally assured by Mr. Dupuy de Lome, when he
                            was under secretary of state, that it was some maritime regulation of
                            each port with which the General Government had nothing to do, and out
                            of compassion for these people presenting these cedulas, who were
                            helpless, having generally left the matter of visa until a day or two
                            before they intended to sail, I have dealt with this matter
                            liberally.</p>
                        <p>From reports of consular officers, as well as inquiries made at the
                            legation of applicants presenting these cedulas, I am convinced that
                            there is a curious entanglement in all this procedure. The General
                            Government of Spain informed me that so far from compelling any
                            foreigner residing in Spain to pay for and receive a cedula de vecindad
                            each year, that in their point of view no need exists for such foreigner
                            either to demand or receive any such cedula. The authorities of the
                            foreign office take the ground that the cedula de vecindad is intended
                            only as a method, long recognized, of identification and protection in
                            Spain of Spanish citizens or subjects, and also an indirect means of
                            taxation for municipal and provincial purposes. They say that the <pb
                                n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0539"/>Spanish Government neither
                            asserts the right, nor is willing to assume the duty, to demand such
                            revenues from foreigners residing in Spain, or afford them of its own
                            motion either the means of identification or protection; that, they say,
                            should be extended only by some certificate, answering to a passport,
                            issued by the proper authority of the country to which such foreigners
                            owe allegiance—as, for example, the certificates of nationality which
                            consular officers of Great Britain are authorized to issue in all parts
                            of the world to citizens of that Empire.</p>
                        <p>The question is full of difficulty, and I do not intend to go deeper into
                            it than I can help in laying this subject before you for consideration;
                            for the Spanish law authorizes, in theory, the issuance of such
                            certificates by foreign consular or diplomatic officers to foreigners
                            resident in Spain only for a certain length of time, after which time if
                            they remain they are supposed to have elected to become Spanish
                            citizens. This consequence, very like many parallel cases in Spain,
                            practically never follows very rigidly, as the condition in practice of
                            such persons seems to be left very much at loose ends. Thus the Spanish
                            Government, so far as the foreign office speaks, holds that these Cubans
                            and Porto Ricans are under no obligation to obtain these cedulas which
                            they offer for registration. On the other hand, as I have said, the
                            steamship companies refuse to give passage without the exhibition of
                            such a cedula, or embarkation on one of their vessels without the visa
                            from some authority of our Government. Many of these Cubans and Porto
                            Ricans have already taken out a cedula of a year ago, which they say
                            they are informed by the local authorities, municipal and provincial,
                            they must have for their identification, to show at any time it is asked
                            of them. It is a fact always stated to me, which I presume to be true,
                            that it is necessary to show such a cedula at a bank, as identification,
                            at arrival at any city in Spain, should it be demanded, and generally at
                            all times to have that or something similar to prove the official
                            existence of the bearer of it if that be officially put in question,
                            which in this country may be a matter of very frequent occurrence,
                            though with equal probability it may never be asked for.</p>
                        <p>In Barcelona and in Madrid, with the utmost frankness and entire
                            innocence, people have come to obtain passports from this legation or
                            the consulate, representing that they are natives of Cuba or Porto Rico,
                            and asking some kind of a certificate to enable them to embark on the
                            steamer. But being informed of the restriction put upon your officers by
                            our circular instruction, they are perfectly willing to go and apply to
                            some Spanish officer, without any proof whatever to identify them, and
                            as a matter of course, they tell me, obtain a cedula stating that the
                            bearer is a native of Cuba or Porto Rico or the Philippine Islands, as
                            they may desire to have inserted in this document. This I am assured is
                            done without any inquiry or evidence for identification on the part of
                            any official of Spain, and this cedula is then brought to us as official
                            conclusive evidence of the nationality of the bearer, which we are
                            supposed to accept and verify. In such cases the consul-general, as well
                            as this legation, have refused to have anything to do with such a cedula
                            unless supported by either oral or documentary evidence tending to show
                            that the person carrying it was really entitled to it; and yet, as I
                            have observed, under special law and custom such a cedula presupposes
                            the presentation of evidence before it has been issued, and to all the
                            rest of the world except ourselves must be considered conclusive as to
                            what it recites.</p>
                        <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0540"/>
                        <p>I may add that not only the foreign office claim that no necessity exists
                            and no urgency should be given of any kind to the taking out of such
                            cedulas on the part of persons not citizens of Spain, but also reprehend
                            in very strong and decided terms the visaing or certification of any
                            such paper by any consular officer of any foreign power. Their ground
                            is, that once taken out under special authority, be that authority one
                            from the General Government or one vested in provincial or municipal
                            officers, it becomes something that can not be made any stronger by the
                            addition of any certification from any foreign power, and that any
                            attempt so to make it is in the nature of a discourtesy. I am informed
                            by our consuls that the local authorities in their places of residence
                            are quite disposed to resent the affix of any visa or cedula on any
                            official paper issued by any Spanish authority, be that general or
                            provincial; and yet, as I have said, there is no doubt that the
                            regulations of the steamship companies are in direct contradiction to
                            this theory, held by the officials of Spain. It would seem if a decided
                            ruling was once given on this subject by the Department action taken
                            thereunder would of necessity bring these conflicting regulations, which
                            concern people claiming our good offices, into direct and formal
                            collision, and some solution might be hoped for.</p>
                        <p>I have inquired of the Department several times what was to be done, and
                            what instructions given consular officers regarding this question, which
                            some time or other must be met and explained, and I now beg to ask
                            again, on consideration of the facts that I have stated, whether your
                            instruction of May 2, 1899, is intended to cover the present existing
                            state of affairs, as would seem to be the idea of the Department from
                            its instruction No. 244.</p>
                        <p>Since the occupation of Cuba and Porto Rico by our authority no cedulas
                            appear to have been issued in either of those islands, but during the
                            last six or seven months there have been brought to this legation and
                            various consular officers entirely different forms of paper, which
                            purport to be passports or certificates of identity.</p>
                        <p>These papers, of which I have already transmitted copies to the
                            Department, asking instructions, are issued, so far as we have seen
                            them, by the “alcaldes” in Porto Rico, and by provincial governors of
                            provinces in Cuba. Those from Porto Rico do not contain any personal
                            description, give no recital of citizenship, but describe the holder
                            only as “vecino” of the city of which the “alcalde” issues the paper.
                            The word “vecino” in Spain may be translated properly “resident of,” but
                            gives no legal affirmation of citizenship. Those issued by the
                            provincial governor of Habana, so far as we have seen, contain a full
                            description of the bearer by way of identification; but with no”
                            positive affirmation as to citizenship or residence, further than the
                            filling in a blank after the printed word “nacionalidad “with the word
                            “Cubana.” The provincial governor of Santiago, on the contrary, issues
                            an official document containing an even more detailed personal
                            appearance list than the other, but with no blank to be filled in, or
                            any other word regarding nationality or residence, and in the body of
                            the paper grants passport to bearer as a native of the city, who can
                            travel freely where-ever he pleases, and asking all the authorities of
                            Cuba and all diplomatic officers (los señores agentes diplomáticos del
                            exterior) to afford protection and aid if needed. Again, there appears a
                            certificate signed officially by the secretary of state and interior of
                            the island of Cuba, who certifies that the bearer, born in Spain, has
                            not exercised a right of option for Spanish nationality provided for in
                            Article IX of the Treaty of <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0541"
                            />Paris—“which fact constitutes the tacit renunciation of his
                            nationality and the protection of the flag of Spain”—and that this paper
                            is given him to prove that fact wherever he may go. This paper was
                            considered by the bearer to be a passport, though it contained no
                            personal identification whatever, and he had demanded the visé of it as
                            such.</p>
                        <p>No passports have been called to my attention as yet issued by the
                            authorities of the Philippine Islands; but the consul at Cadiz had
                            demanded my opinion as to his proper course should a passport, in any
                            form, purporting to be issued by some authority in the Philippine
                            Islands and countersigned by the military authorities, be presented to
                            him for registration and visé, while he, the consul, had direct
                            knowledge that the bearer was born in Spain, had been in the Philippine
                            Islands a very short time before the taking possession of them by the
                            United States forces, and had been attempting, in vain, in the
                            Philippines, to obtain naturalization as a United States citizen, or
                            even to have some overt act pointed out to him by which he could legally
                            and safely renounce his Spanish citizenship. Should this passport be
                            presented, it probably will be in a different form, and certified to by
                            a different class of officers than any of those I have above
                            mentioned.</p>
                        <p>It was in view of all these differing classes and kinds of official
                            papers, and the fact that every consular officer in Spain has repeatedly
                            asked me for instructions on this subject, and as well upon the earnest
                            and often repeated request of the consul-general at Barcelona and the
                            consul at Cadiz, the two places most largely interested outside of
                            Madrid, that I wrote my dispatch No. 306, of November 6. It was then, it
                            is even more so now, very necessary, for the protection of persons
                            entitled thereto; for the refusal to protect persons not entitled to ask
                            our interference; for the smoothness of relations between the consular
                            officers of the ports and the Spanish local authorities, and to enable
                            me to speak authoritatively and clearly to the foreign office on this
                            general subject, that an explicit, clear instruction, covering all the
                            cases that have come to my notice, as well as cases parallel which
                            obviously may arise, be prepared by the Department.</p>
                        <p>I am fully aware of the complicated condition of affairs in these
                            territories, and the fact that the Department is depending in great
                            measure for advice on this subject upon the War Department.
                            Nevertheless, the officers of the United States in Spain should be
                            informed what officials in Cuba, or in Porto Rico, or in the Philippines
                            are authorized to issue certificates of identity, which we should
                            recognize, be such papers called cédulas, passports, certificates, or
                            any other name that may be given to them. We should also know what these
                            papers should contain in order that we may give them in Spain the
                            fortification of the seal of the legation or consulate, as the case may
                            be.</p>
                        <p>I am expecting at any time that we may be brought face to face with the
                            case that some Spanish official, whether general or local, or some
                            steamship company, thereby being a semiofficial personage, may refuse to
                            recognize our visé on the ground that it is interfering with what is
                            simply and purely a Spanish paper, and I shall not be in any position to
                            answer inquiries addressed to me of such a case.</p>
                        <p>I have been asked verbally, over and over again, by the foreign office
                            and various members of the diplomatic corps, how far we considered the
                            governments of Cuba and Porto Rico governments either under or
                            concurrent with that of the United States, so as to expect their acts
                            should certify their official seals.</p>
                        <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0542"/>
                        <p>It would appear from the nature of some of these passports from Cuba that
                            it is taken for granted the government in Cuba has the right to call
                            upon foreign diplomatic officers outside of Cuba to recognize its seal
                            and the signature of its officers. I presume that that is intended to
                            apply to diplomatic officers of the United States, although the recital
                            in such passports is a question to be entirely open; and yet I can
                            hardly suppose it is to be considered that by such recital we officers
                            of the United States become diplomatic officers of the Cuban
                            government.</p>
                        <p>I only cite these instances to show how circumstances have changed since
                            your general instruction of May 2, 1899, and the advisability of the
                            Department’s taking up these questions and deciding them once for all,
                            instead of leaving us in the possibility of taking some action which
                            will hereafter be disavowed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department has received your No. 363,
                            of December 20, 1900, on the subject of cédulas and passports presented
                            by residents of Porto Rico, Cuba, and the Philippine Islands. Your
                            comprehensive statement of the complications now arising will serve to
                            guide the Department in specific instructions at some future day, and
                            the desirability of such instructions is freely admitted. For the
                            present, however, your course in authenticating the cédulas and
                            passports, when it can not be avoided, is approved, and while the
                            confusion you have described is to be regretted, the Department feels
                            that the wisest course to pursue is to meet each case as it arises and
                            treat it individually with good judgment and discretion. It is not
                            thought that the time is ripe for formulating a general and permanent
                            plan for dealing with the subject.</p>
                        <p>So far as Cuba is concerned, the status of the inhabitants is still
                            undefined, and, in fact, delegates of the people are now actually in
                            session for the purpose of giving some definite destiny to the island.
                            In the event of the withdrawal of United States authority Cuban
                            passports or documents would be of no concern to the diplomatic
                            representatives of the United States.</p>
                        <p>As for the Philippine Islands, the existing conditions are of a character
                            that can not, as it would seem, long continue, and legislation by the
                            Congress must be awaited before the Department can issue instructions on
                            the subject of the status of the inhabitants that are certain of any
                            stability.</p>
                        <p>In Porto Rico a full civil government is in successful operation under
                            the laws of the United States; but, as you are well aware, the Supreme
                            Court of the United States now has before it a case involving the status
                            of the people of that island and of the Philippines, and the Department
                            prefers to await the decision now pending before sending an instruction
                            involving a question at issue before the court.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the Department’s telegram to you of November <pb
                                n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0543"/>6, 1900, your understanding of
                            it was correct. It was meant to authorize the visé or authentication of
                            cedulas and passports presented by Cubans and Porto Ricans, and by
                            Filipinos when issued or countersigned by the military authorities of
                            the United States in the Philippines.</p>

                            cases apprehended by me as likely to arise and create difficulty, as
                            outlined in mv dispatch No. 363,<note n="a" xml:id="d407fna">Printed

                            December, 1900, seems to have arisen at Barcelona.</p>
                        <p>The consul-general communicates that a Cuban-born young man, bearing a
                            Cuban passport issued by the military authorities of Cuba, as well as a
                            certificate of identification and legal residence in Habana issued by
                            the authorities of that city, was duly registered at the
                            consulate-general, and his papers legalized according to Department’s
                            circular of May 2, 1899.</p>
                        <p>In the drawing names for conscription into the Spanish army, which was
                            held during the month of January, this Cuban, whose name is Benito
                            Llavería y Pascual, was notified that his name was among those liable to
                            be drawn for military service. Presenting himself at the commission
                            charged with this official duty (la comision mixta de quintas) he showed
                            his passport and certificate, which the secretary of the commission
                            refused to look at or consider in any way. At his request the
                            consul-general, on the 7th January, formally notified this commission of
                            the fact above stated, giving full details and particulars. In response
                            to this communication the consul-general received no answer until after
                            the drawing of the names by lot for military service had been completed.
                            Among those drawn for service was the name of this Cuban, Llavería y
                            Pascual; and not until then did the commission answer the
                            consul-general’s letter. A copy of their answer—if answer it may be
                            called—together with a translation, I inclose as part of this
                            dispatch.</p>
                        <p>The consul-general reported this matter to me immediately by telegram as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Cuban subject Llavería impressed Spanish army. Bears Cuban
                                    passport issued military authorities Cuba. Has complied Article
                                    IX treaty of peace. Shall I protest local authorities? They know
                                    he is registered in consulate.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>To which I replied as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Protest formally against action regarding Cuban with passport and
                                    transmit full particulars to this legation.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Subsequently the consul-general forwarded me the copy of the letter of
                            the commission that I have alluded to, with the information that he had
                            followed my suggestions, and had formally, in writing, protested against
                            the inclusion of this man in the military service of Spain. The date of
                            this protest was January 23, 1901, and I have heard of no reply
                            thereto.</p>
                        <p>I report this matter now, that the Department may have on its files the
                            case, so far as yet it has developed itself, as it is possible I may be
                            obliged to communicate in relation thereto by cable, which would not be
                            understood were these papers not in Washington.</p>
                        <p>I have delayed bringing the matter, even unofficially, before the
                            ministry of state, until either some official answer has been made by
                                <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0545"/>the commission to the
                            consul-general, or until some overt act, more than has yet come to pass,
                            may be threatened by the military authorities at Barcelona. It may be,
                            of course, that the protest of the consul-general will be sufficient,
                            and that the Spanish local authorities there will let the matter die out
                            without any formal reply.</p>

                            <p>It was yesterday decided to reply to your esteemed favor of the 7th
                                of this month, in which you give various facts in regard to the man
                                Benito Llavería y Pascual, as I now have the honor of doing; that he
                                was included in the penalty of article 31 of the recruiting law in
                                force during the conscription of 1898 in this city, and that
                                afterward the chief of zone No. 6, on February 22, 1899, made it
                                known officially that said man had failed to present himself at the
                                concentration, and for this reason the “process of fugitive” was
                                instituted against him, and that he was declared a fugitive on April
                                4 of said year 1899, which is his actual situation to-day; that no
                                proceedings whatever in this matter are pending before the mixed
                                commission, nor has any motion as yet been made by this man, and,
                                furthermore, that in the communication which you sent to this
                                commission on the mentioned date the object and purpose of the same
                                is not clearly stated, nor what question has been presented in the

                                Llavería which gave occasion for said communication. I therefore beg
                                of you to please amplify the same, specifically stating the object

                            perform military service, against which the United States consul at
                            Barcelona has protested. You state that Mr. Llavería bears a Cuban
                            passport, issued by the military authorities of Cuba, as well as a
                            certificate of identification and legal residence in Habana, issued by
                            the authorities of that city, and that he was duly registered at the
                            United States consulate-general at Barcelona, and his papers had been
                            legalized according to the Department’s circular of May 2, 1899.</p>
                        <p>It is inferred that Mr. Llavería comes within the description of “native
                            inhabitants of Cuba temporarily sojourning abroad,” for whose protection
                            our diplomatic and consular officers were instructed by the Department’s
                            circular of May 2, 1899, to exercise good offices. The statement
                            telegraphed to you by the consul-general that Mr. Llavería “has complied
                            Article IX, treaty peace,” is not understood. That article only provides
                            for the retention of Spanish allegiance by Spanish subjects, natives of
                            the peninsula, residing in the relinquished or ceded territories. It
                            does not provide for the case of a native <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466"
                                facs="0546"/>Cuban, residing in Cuba, Spain or elsewhere, so that it
                            is not seen how Mr. Llavería could make any effective declaration under
                            Article IX. The consul-general may be asked for an explanation on this
                            point.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your instruction No. 297, bearing date February 21, 1901, and
                            to say that pursuant thereto I requested the consul-general at Barcelona
                            to make the explanation desired, as well as to communicate to me the
                            present status of the case of Benito Llavería y Pascual.</p>
                        <p>I have received from the consul-general, evidently crossing my letter to
                            him, certain communications which seem to complete the record in that
                            matter so far as the authorities in Barcelona are concerned. I beg to
                            inclose a copy of the letter of the consul-general covering copy of an
                            official letter, together with a translation of the same, from the
                            president of the mixed commission of enlistment (comision mixta de
                            reclutamiento) of the province of Barcelona, from which it will be seen
                            that the authorities of that province maintain their position that the
                            young man in question is liable to military service, and that the
                            consul-general’s protest and request for his exemption have been finally
                            refused.</p>
                        <p>In view of my desire to observe most carefully the wishes of the
                            Department, that nothing should be done, officially, which would tend in
                            any way toward misconstruction of the relations of our Government with
                            the inhabitants of Cuba, just at the time when that question is being
                            authoritatively settled, I have deemed it wise to refer this whole
                            matter for the consideration of the Department, as it is the first, and,
                            so far, the only case, that has come to my notice of a native of Cuba or
                            Porto Rico claimed for Spanish military service. * * *</p>
                        <p>While the change of government and the coming into power of the liberal
                            party may not produce an equally profound change in the nature of the
                            laws to be presented to the new Cortes, when it shall have been elected,
                            still it may have that effect; and I think it wise to await
                            developments, inasmuch as I understand that no practical injury will
                            result to the interests of this young Cuban in question, until
                            sufficient time has elapsed for full consideration of the proper steps
                            to be taken or proper claims to be made to the Spanish Government.</p>
                        <p>The attention of the new ministry is, almost inevitably, occupied at
                            present by the steps, natural and necessary to the social and political
                            life of Spain, for the preparation of the election of the new Cortes,
                            the date of which has, not yet been fixed. It is considered, without a
                            dissenting voice, that this Government, as all governments in Spain
                            since the establishment of the constitution, will have a working
                            majority in the new Cortes, as it is considered equally natural and
                            necessary for it to take the precautions and political steps to bring
                            this about. Until that is done I feel confident that no important
                            decision will be taken regarding changes in international affairs from
                            the course <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0547"/>pursued by the
                            former Government, but everything will be held in abeyance for a month
                            or six weeks at any event. I say this only to show the Department that,
                            in my judgment, no reason exists that I should receive any instructions
                            in this particular case until full consideration, or even, possibly, the
                            lapse of time, may bring about a solution of the general question
                            involved.</p>

                            <p>Having examined the “expediente” (petition) of the young man Benito
                                Llavería Pascual who came forward with the drafts for 1898 under No.
                                1 as a conscript from the fourth district of this city;</p>
                            <p>Bearing in mind that the young man Llavería in the enlistment of 1898
                                of the section of the fourth district of this city incurred the
                                penalty of article 31 of the existing recruiting regulations for not
                                being in that of the year corresponding to his age nor in the year
                                immediately following;</p>
                            <p>Taking into account that the said young man appealed to this
                                commission in writing on the 14th of February, 1898, stating that he
                                was then 23 years of age; that he was a native of Habana temporarily
                                residing in this city at No. 317 Aragon street, second floor, and
                                that, having been included at the head of the enlistment list of the
                                recruiting section of the fourth district of this city for that
                                year, he petitioned that orders be given to said section to exempt
                                him from enlistment, being a native of Cuba temporarily resident in
                                this city with the object of accompanying his father for the sake of
                                his health; stating further that although they were included in the
                                “padròn” (town list) of that date it was merely as temporary
                                residents, seeing that they were also inscribed in the town list of
                                Habana, where they practiced their profession and paid taxes;</p>
                            <p>Taking into account that along with said appeal he inclosed his
                                baptismal certificate, duly legalized, showing that he was born on
                                June 24, 1875, in Habana, his parents being natives of the province
                                of Tarragona, and a certified copy of the resolution of the
                                recruiting section of the said district adopted on the 30th of
                                January, 1898, declaring that there was no reason for granting
                                freedom from enlistment to the young man in question;</p>
                            <p>Taking into account that in the copy of the aforementioned resolution
                                of the section of January 30, 1898, it appears that the decision was
                                based upon the fact that the young man Llavería was included in the
                                enlistment owing to his figuring on the “padrón municipal”
                                (municipal town list) taken on the 21st of December, 1885, in force
                                at that time, so that when the young man was placed on the list his
                                father had already resided in this city three years at No. 317
                                Aragon street; that the fact of the <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468"
                                    facs="0548"/>young man being a native of the island of Cuba did
                                not destroy his Spanish nationality; that the residence of the
                                father in the locality renders the son liable to enlistment, and,
                                finally, that at the proper time, when he should have been enlisted
                                without incurring any penalty, his father already resided in the
                                fourth district of this city, where he continued to reside on the
                                aforenamed date of January 30, 1898;</p>
                            <p>Seeing that this commission, in session of March 30, 1898, decided
                                that there was no reason for exempting the young man Llavería from
                                being enlisted in the fourth district of this city, nor for
                                absolving him from the penalty of first on the list according to
                                article 50 of the recruiting regulations unless he had been enlisted
                                previously in some other town with greater right than in the list of
                                the fourth district of this city;</p>
                            <p>Seeing that on January 7 last the United States vice-consul in this
                                city wrote a dispatch to this commission stating that the young man
                                Llavería, a native of Habana, is registered as a Cuban at said
                                consulate; that the aforesaid young man came to Spain in the year
                                1895, returning to Cuba in March, 1898, arriving there on April 1 of
                                the same year, prior to the date of the treaty of Paris, having
                                complied with all the requirements of Article IX of that treaty, and
                                that he afterwards left Habana in the month of June, 1899, for
                                Spain, having previously obtained a passport duly signed by the
                                authorities of the island of Cuba, in which his identity is set
                                forth;</p>
                            <p>Seeing that the object of the vice-consul’s letter was not clear, a
                                communication was addressed to the said vice-consul on the 11th of
                                the same month of January, requesting him to specify the object of
                                his letter of the 7th of that month; seeing that on the 28th day of
                                January the United States vice-consul, referring to his letter of
                                the 7th of the same month, informed this commission that the young
                                man Llavería is properly registered at that consulate as a Cuban
                                citizen in accordance with the requirements of the treaty of Paris,
                                having fulfilled all the conditions necessary to prove his Cuban
                                nationality, which citizens are under the protection of the United
                                States, and requesting that the same be exempted from Spanish
                                military service;</p>
                            <p>Seeing that on the 8th of last February this commission instructed
                                the section of the fourth district of this city to send a certified
                                copy of the sheet of the “padrón municipal” (municipal town list),
                                taken on December 21, 1885, corresponding to folio 15 of the first
                                volume of the house No. 317, second floor, of Aragon street of this
                                city, relating to the family of the young man Benito Llavería
                                Pascual, and that the said section sent the sheet in question along
                                with a communication dated the 11th of February last, in which it
                                appears that the said list, instead of having been made on the 21st
                                day of December of the year 1885, as previously stated, was made on
                                the 21st day of December of the year 1895, and that at that time the
                                father had resided three years as a tenant of the house in question
                                and the young man four months as a temporary resident;</p>
                            <p>Considering that according to article 1 of the constitution in force
                                since June 30, 1876, all those born on Spanish territory are
                                Spaniards, and that therefore the young man Llavería was a Spaniard
                                in the month of March, 1898, when he was included in the enlistment
                                of the fourth district of this city, with the penalty of article 31
                                of the recruiting regulations, seeing that the island of Cuba, where
                                he was born at that date, still belonged to Spain;</p>
                            <p>Considering that not only at the time when he should have been
                                enlisted without the aforementioned penalty, but also in 1898, when
                                he was enlisted with that penalty, his father was a resident in
                                Barcelona, having lived for three years in the locality of the
                                fourth district of this city, and neither he nor his father having
                                asked that he should be included in the enlistment of 1894, which
                                was that corresponding to his age, nor in the next following, the
                                aforementioned section was obliged to include him in the first
                                enlistment following the discovery of this omission, with the
                                penalty of article 31 of the recruiting regulations as ordered
                                therein;</p>
                            <p>Considering that the fact that in the town list of 1895 he figures as
                                a visitor (passer through) was no obstacle to this being done,
                                because what determines the enlistment of a young man is, according
                                to article 40 of the aforesaid regulations under numbers 1 and 2, in
                                the first place, the residence of his parents, and, as already
                                stated, the father of the young man in question, in 1895, had
                                already resided three yearns at the place indicated; and is
                                classified in the town list as a resident.</p>
                            <p>Considering that neither did the provisions of the royal order of
                                November 14, 1888, relating to the exemption from service of those
                                born in the colonies, apply in the case of this young man when he
                                was enlisted, nor at the time when he ought to have been enlisted
                                without penalty, because for that purpose it was indispensable that
                                the father’s residence in the Peninsula should not have been a
                                permanent one, as it was, according to the town list of 1895;</p>
                            <p>Considering that the purport of Article IX of the treaty of peace
                                between Spam and the United States in no way affects the present
                                case, seeing that the facts dealt with occurred prior to the date of
                                the ratification of the said treaty, which was in April of 1899;</p>
                            <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0549"/>
                            <p>Considering that in view of all that has been stated it is evident
                                that the young man Llavería is liable to military service in Spain,
                                even in the hypothesis that he at present no longer retains his
                                Spanish nationality, this circumstance, seeing that the Spanish
                                nationality was lost after the date when he should legally have
                                performed that service, can not exempt him from the fulfillment of
                                obligations under which he was before the loss of his
                                nationality;</p>
                            <p>In view of the proofs brought forward,</p>
                            <p>This commission, in session of the 28th of last February, decided
                                that you should be informed, as I have herewith the honor of doing,
                                that there is no reason to grant your request made on the 28th day
                                of January last, that the young man Benito Llavería Pascual should
                                be exempted from Spanish military service.</p>
                            <p>May God protect you many years.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            No. 432, of the 16th ultimo, in regard to the case of Mr. Benito
                            Llavería Pascual, who has been called on to perform military service in
                            Spain.</p>
                        <p>It appears from the inclosures in your dispatch that Mr. Llavería was
                            born in Habana, Cuba, in 1875; that he went to Barcelona, Spain, in
                            1895, where his father had been residing for at least three years; that
                            he returned to Cuba April 1, 1898, and again left Habana for Spain in
                            June, 1899, having previously obtained a passport from the authorities
                            of the island. He was also registered in the office of the United States
                            consul at Barcelona as a Cuban citizen.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish authorities state that Mr. Llaveria was subject to enlistment
                            in the Spanish army, and was included in the enlistment of March, 1898,
                            at which time his father had been for three years a resident of
                            Barcelona, and young Llaveria a resident there for four months; that at
                            that time Llaveria was a Spaniard (having been born on Spanish
                            territory), and that he is liable to military service even on the
                            hypothesis that he at present no longer retains his Spanish nationality
                            as the loss of such nationality after the date when he should legally
                            have performed the service can not exempt him from fulfillment of the
                            obligation which he was under.</p>
                        <p>If, under the Spanish law, Mr. Llaveria was liable to military service
                            when he was enrolled in March, 1898, the Department is inclined to think
                            that the Spanish view is correct. A Subsequent change of nationality
                            would not operate to discharge the obligation. You may examine this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s circular of May 2, 1899, only authorizes our diplomatic
                            and consular officers to exercise good offices for the protection of
                            “native inhabitants of Cuba temporarily residing abroad.” The consul at
                            Barcelona has protested against the action of the Spanish authorities in
                            this case.</p>
                        <p>The Department will therefore take no further action on it until it shall
                            have received a report from you on the point above referred to.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of
                            your instruction No. 320 with regard to the case of Mr. Benito Llaveria
                            Pascual, called upon to perform military service in Spain.</p>
                        <p>I particularly note your ruling on the general question involved in this
                            case, as submitted by the consulate-general at Barcelona. Your
                            instruction says “a subsequent change of nationality would not operate
                            to discharge the obligation”—“if under Spanish law, Mr. Llaveria was
                            liable when enrolled in March, 1898.” I take the greater note of this as
                            it was my own opinion before transmitting the case to the Department,
                            and the importance that the question might assume in other cases made it
                            advisable to obtain a general ruling as has been now given. Your
                            instruction, however, to examine the question whether under Spanish law
                            Mr. Llaveria was liable to military service in March, 1898, has been
                            complied with to the best of my ability. An examination of the text of
                            the laws and regulations concerning recruitment in the army, which took
                            effect August 28, 1896, leads me to the conclusion that the carefully
                            prepared and elaborately argued legal opinion of the Spanish commission
                            of recruitment No. 609, of which a copy was transmitted with my dispatch
                            No. 432 of April 16, is in full compliance with the law of Spain, and
                            that Mr. Benito Llaveria Pascual was by Spanish law domiciled in
                            Barcelona at the time of his enrollment in 1898; was of proper age to be
                            enrolled, and his failure to present himself for such purpose places him
                            entirely under the penal sections cited by the commission.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of
                            your unnumbered dispatch, bearing date May 13, confirming your
                                cablegram<note n="a" xml:id="d415fna">Printed ante.</note> of May
                            11.</p>
                        <p>I beg to confirm my cablegram<note n="a" xml:id="d415fnb">Printed
                                ante.</note> to you of May 17.</p>
                        <p>It is exceedingly difficult to obtain accurate information.</p>
                        <p>The Madrid junta was at all times only a subsidiary one to the central
                            junta in Paris, of which Agoncillo has always been, and is still, I
                            presume, considered the head. The junta in Madrid, and, as far as I can
                            ascertain, the subsidiary ones in Spain to it, received funds from
                            Paris; but remittances have long ago ceased from that quarter.</p>
                        <p>From all that I can learn I am strongly of the opinion that nothing of
                            any importance in the way of organization exists in Madrid. The offices
                            of this so-called junta, or political club, composed of Filipinos, has,
                            during the last two years, descended steadily in character of locality
                            and surroundings. From the business part of the city it has descended to
                            quite the poor quarters. I have been able to obtain a list of their
                            different removals, and it is evident they have not a cent <pb n="472"
                                xml:id="pg_472" facs="0552"/>to spend. Many of these Filipinos, of
                            which there have been quite a number in Madrid, are men of high
                            education, and had come here to complete their university courses; and
                            much of the money that enabled them to keep up their position before the
                            world probably came from their own pockets. I can not find that they
                            were ever of any political importance, and they confined themselves,
                            apparently, trying to keep alive a spirit of hostility toward the United
                            States among the Spaniards. In all political circles they have utterly
                            failed, and I know that no Spaniard of any prominence or position has
                            any wish that they should succeed in prolonging the disturbances in
                            those islands. All the interests of every commercial class in Spain, and
                            in fact of all Spain, are that those islands should be immediately
                            pacified, and continue to be, as in the past two years they have been,
                            an increasing market for Spanish products, instead of a failing one.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>The opinions that I have been able to gather from the best sources of
                            information attainable, fully carry out my first impression, that while
                            the ashes of hostility to the United States still exist here in Madrid
                            among natives of the Philippine Islands, they will never kindle into
                            warmth until they have both money and encouragement from outside.</p>
                        <p>The talk in the newspapers here, which has been more or less telegraphed
                            to journals in the United States, if sifted down, I think is found to be
                            nothing more than the natural attempt of individuals who. at one time
                            had a certain cheap newspaper notoriety to keep that notoriety alive for
                            their own vanity, or possibly to give themselves some personal and
                            financial credit.</p>
                        <p>Should anything definite of any importance come to my ears, or can be
                            found at Barcelona, which, after all, is the center of all oriental
                            trade and travel with Spain, I will, of course, cable you. It is to be
                            remarked, however, that the simplest method for any person desiring to
                            go to the Philippine Islands from Spain without his voyage being noticed
                            would be to pass the frontier into France and take steamer from any
                            other port of Europe, all of which are open to him, and most of them
                            having lines to the Orient.</p>
                        <p>For all the consul-general can be assured, there may have been scores of
                            Filipinos under assumed names, or under Filipino names, gone back
                            through Barcelona, as the travel is large, and no identification further
                            than the formal papers are required for passage.</p>

                            Sickles’s No. 515, of the 17th ultimo, inclosing copy of a letter from
                            Isabelo de los Reyes, requesting amnesty and permission to return to the
                            Philippine Islands, provided this Government will guarantee his personal
                            liberty and security.</p>
                        <p>The matter was referred to the Secretary of War for his
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Root regards it as unwise to issue any guaranty to Mr. de los Reyes.
                            He states that if the applicant goes to Manila, takes the oath of
                            allegiance, and conducts himself in conformity with existing laws, there
                            is no intention to prosecute him for past acts. The Secretary adds,
                            however, that neither the applicant’s record nor his present importance
                            calls for special favor from this Government.</p>
                        <p>This Department understands Mr. de los Reyes’s letter as not involving
                            any question of the issuance of a passport nor certification of his
                            status as a native of the Philippines. He is understood merely to
                            surrender and to ask to be permitted to return to the Philippines.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Majesty</hi>: Since the 10th of December,
                                1898, when the treaty of peace with the United States of America was
                                signed, it has been a subject of constant preoccupation to the
                                succeeding Spanish Governments to solve in a just and equitable way
                                the important questions concerning the nationality of the natives
                                and inhabitants of the territories ceded or relinquished by Spain
                                arising in connection with the interpretation of the ninth article
                                of that treaty. With this end in view the former Government
                                entrusted the study of these important questions to a committee
                                composed of learned functionaries from the ministries of state,
                                grace and justice, hacienda, and gobernacion, which fulfilled its
                                task by publishing a brilliant report wherein the various delicate
                                aspects of the question are treated with the greatest clearness and
                                accuracy.</p>
                            <p>The Government, desirous of reconciling the interests of private
                                individuals with its international obligations, without increasing
                                unduly the charges upon the national treasury, and at the same time
                                attempting to harmonize the political and economical aspects of the
                                question, has come to the conclusion that while there can be no
                                doubt as regards the fact that natives and inhabitants of the
                                territories ceded or relinquished lost their Spanish citizenship the
                                moment that the sovereignty of Spain over those countries came to an
                                end, nevertheless those, persons who while residing outside of the
                                country of their origin made a clear manifestation of their desire
                                to retain their Spanish citizenship, either by having themselves
                                inscribed in a legation or consulate of Spain abroad, or by
                                continuing to serve in the administration, or by establishing
                                themselves within the actual dominions of Spain, deserve to be
                                considered by the Government as Spanish subjects so long as the acts
                                which manifest their purpose of retaining Spanish citizenship be not
                                disavowed by the solemn declaration of the party in interest made
                                within a certain period which will be fixed for this purpose.</p>
                            <p>A further point of real importance is that in regard to the exact
                                moment when the fact of residing within or without the territories
                                ceded or relinquished by Spain began to be a determining factor. As
                                to this the Government takes the ground that it can be no other than
                                the moment at which the change of sovereignty was judicially defined
                                to have taken place, viz, the moment of the exchange of the
                                ratifications of the treaty of peace. Likewise it appears entirely
                                free from doubt that all the persons who while they may have been
                                born in the above-mentioned territories and living therein at said
                                date are, nevertheless, still discharging official functions by
                                virtue of appointment or commission held from the Spanish
                                Government, should preserve their nationality.</p>
                            <p>There remained another point of great importance to be solved, viz,
                                the manner in which those who have lost their citizenship by not
                                availing themselves of the opportunity provided in the first
                                paragraph of the ninth article of the treaty should recover the
                                same, and nothing can be more just than to facilitate the recovery
                                of citizenship by those who lost it in this manner, and that they
                                should recover it by leaving said territories and fulfilling the
                                requirements prescribed in the second paragraph of article 19<note
                                    n="a" xml:id="d418fna">See Appendix I.</note> of the civil code;
                                provided, however, that said persons have not held public office or
                                taken part in the elections in the territories ceded or relinquished
                                by Spain, nor exercised therein any right pertaining to the new
                                citizenship since the extinction of the Spanish sovereignty, since
                                such acts would prevent their being recognized as Spanish subjects,
                                unless it be in the manner set forth in article 21<note n="b"
                                    xml:id="d418fnb">See Appendix II.</note> of the civil code.</p>
                            <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0555"/>
                            <p>Finally, another object of especial care and attention to the
                                Government of Your Majesty has been that which refers both to the
                                right of many natives of our former colonies to continue to enjoy
                                the fixed annual payments which they receive from the treasury in
                                the nature of pensions, as well as to the right of others to demand,
                                on account of eminent services rendered to the country in person or
                                by those from whom their rights are derived, pensions to reward
                                therefor. It is furthermore but right that those who recover their
                                citizenship should be restored to the enjoyment of the pensions to
                                which they are legally entitled, making the payment of these,
                                nevertheless, depend, as only seems just, upon residence within
                                Spanish territory and the previous examination of their respective
                                claims; and it must be understood that the restoration of their
                                pensions will commence only from the time at which application
                                therefor is made.</p>
                            <p>Lastly, natives of the aforesaid territories who can not leave them
                                and who may have rendered, as has been said before, distinguished
                                services to the country, shall be entitled to obtain pensions as a
                                reward, for the Spanish nation can not neglect to protect those who
                                have nobly defended its interests; but the obtaining of said
                                pensions must in every case be subject to the special proceedings
                                prescribed by the law of the 12th of May, 1837, as the unusual
                                character of this class of pensions calls for.</p>
                            <p>Carrying out the foregoing ideas, the undersigned minister has the
                                honor to submit to the approbation of Your Majesty the following
                                project of law.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I shall be pleased to have you sound the
                            Spanish Government, with the utmost discretion possible, in order to
                            ascertain whether it would be willing to afford this Government such
                            assistance as may seem to the Royal Government right and appropriate in
                            the defense of the claims which are now being presented by United States
                            citizens to the Spanish Treaty Claims Commission, recently organized by
                            the President to carry into effect the provisions of Article VII of the
                            treaty of peace.</p>
                        <p>I have unofficially conversed with the Spanish minister at this capital
                            in regard to this matter and he has promised to bring it himself to the
                            attention of his Government.</p>
                        <p>The Department suggests the following method of arranging for the
                            communication of the claims:</p>
                        <p>The United States Government should submit to the Spanish Government in
                            some form previously arranged a copy of the petition of each claimant,
                            together with a memorandum of any additional information obtained from
                            the papers in the Department of State or otherwise; and should request
                            the Spanish Government to investigate all the facts connected with the
                            claim which may tend to throw light on its merits, and submit a
                            confidential memorandum thereon showing any defense which Spain would
                            have been able to make thereto, if all such claims had not been assumed
                            by the United States in virtue of the treaty of peace, and also
                            submitting such suggestions as the Spanish officials may deem pertinent
                            to a proper defense by the United States against the claim.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It already having been known to the
                            Department that I had deemed it better not to present the request of
                            your instruction No. 343, bearing date June 10, 1901, to the Spanish
                            Government, until the return of the counterdraft of the treaty of amity,
                            I have the honor to <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0558"/>report that
                            I yesterday had a long and confidential conversation with the minister
                            of state on the subject of your above-mentioned instruction.</p>
                        <p>He had already been, as is known to the Department, informed of this
                            desire through the minister of Spain at Washington, and said that the
                            Spanish Government would most cheerfully and gladly undertake to do what
                            it could in the direction indicated, both through the correspondence
                            from Washington through the Duke de Arcos, and now proposed by myself.
                            He said there would be one or two conditions which he would feel obliged
                            to put in force, one being that care should be taken that the language
                            of the papers describing the claim transmitted to the Spanish Government
                            should not be of such a character as to be needlessly offensive or
                            hostile either to the Spanish Government or to its administration in its
                            former colonies. He said that some of the papers transmitted by the Duke
                            de Arcos were worded in such a way as to render it necessary that he
                            should make this condition.</p>
                        <p>The result of our conversation was that I should formally, without delay,
                            address him officially the request in full, at the same time indicating
                            the plan of procedure suggested, and both by himself and myself
                            considered the most practical.</p>
                        <p>This I have done at once, and am to receive an official reply without
                            delay, giving the conditions or any possible limitations which the
                            Spanish Government may find itself obliged to make.</p>
                        <p>I should add that, so far as the minister of state represents the Spanish
                            Government, our request will be met in the best spirit, with every
                            intention to carry it out in the way most satisfactory to the legal
                            representatives of the United States before the commission.</p>
                        <p>I transmit herewith a copy of the letter I am to-day addressing to the
                            minister of state, and so soon as an answer is received I will report it
                            to the Department for the use of the commission.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: Whereas the commission
                                appointed by the President of the United States to examine and pass
                                upon all claims for which the United States has made itself
                                responsible under Article VII of the treaty of Paris has already
                                begun its labors, I have the honor to inform you that I am
                                instructed by my Government to ascertain whether the Government of
                                His Majesty would be willing to afford the United States such
                                assistance as may seem right and appropriate in the defense of
                                claims which are now being presented by United States citizens
                                before the said commission.</p>
                            <p>My Government hopes that this request will be looked upon as one
                                falling within the scope of international comity between friendly
                                nations and in furtherance of justice in giving information which
                                will enable the commission to allow with safety all well-founded and
                                just claims, as well as to reject such as are pushed without good’
                                cause or to an exaggerated extent.</p>
                            <p>Feeling confident myself that this request is one which will commend
                                itself to the good feeling and discretion of the Government of His
                                Majesty, I venture even now to outline a practical method which
                                would, in the opinion of my Government, effectively bring about the
                                desired results.</p>
                            <p>It is suggested that the United States Government should submit,
                                through its representative at Madrid, to the Government of His
                                Majesty, through the ministry of state, over which you so worthily
                                preside, a clear and succinct statement of the petition <pb n="479"
                                    xml:id="pg_479" facs="0559"/>of each claimant as it is filed
                                before the Commission of Claims at Washington, accompanying this
                                with a memorandum of all additional information relating to and
                                affecting such claim which may be found within the control of the
                                Government of the United States.</p>
                            <p>At the time of this submission the Government of the United States
                                will request of the Government of His Majesty to investigate all the
                                facts connected with the claim in question which may in anyway tend
                                to throw light upon its merits or upon the amount justly due; and
                                that through the ministry of state there should be transmitted to
                                the representative of the United States at Madrid a confidential
                                memorandum indicating any and all defenses, both on the merits or in
                                the amount of the claim, which the Spanish Government would have
                                been able to make thereto had not all such claims been assumed by
                                the United States under the treaty of Paris; and also such further
                                suggestions and indications as the officials of the Government of
                                His Majesty charged with this matter, in their discretion, may deem
                                pertinent to the defense against such claim by the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>May I ask your excellency’s consideration of this plan and request
                                that I may be informed as to what changes, in principle or in
                                detail, by which, in your discretion, it would be rendered in any
                                way more practical or sure. I also beg your excellency will inform
                                me under what conditions or restrictions the Government of His
                                Majesty will find themselves able to comply with the request I have
                                had the honor to lay before you.</p>

                            subject of my dispatch No. 590, bearing date December 14, 1901, to
                            report that I have just received, through the minister of state, the
                            official answer of the Spanish Government to our request for aid in
                            obtaining evidence in the hearing of claims before the Spanish Claims
                            Commission, established pursuant to the treaty of Paris.</p>
                        <p>I beg to inclose a copy and a translation of the same.</p>
                        <p>In view both of the importance that there should be no misunderstanding
                            in this matter, and also of the fact that I am temporarily incapacitated
                            from personally examining the scope of the technically legal phrases in
                            Spanish employed by the Spanish Government, I venture—perhaps
                            needlessly—to request the close attention of the Department to the
                            language of this answer, and also to the translation. I am not confident
                            that the translation is at the same time absolutely accurate and
                            absolutely clear under our own system of the law involving “res
                            adjudicata.”</p>
                        <p>It will be seen that in response to my request that the Spanish
                            Government should point out any detail which would render of more
                            practical efficacy the course of procedure desired, it is suggested that
                            each case transmitted to the Spanish Government be accompanied by a
                            memorandum of questions or interrogatory, specifying exactly the points
                            upon which information is desired.</p>
                        <p>It will also be seen that the conditions precedent, asked by the Spanish
                            Government, are: First, that the language of the petition and other
                            papers submitted through this legation shall not be disrespectful to
                            Spain, nor reflecting unduly upon the Spanish administration; and,
                            second, that this information thus furnished shall not be made the
                            subject of debate, and so far as it consists of decisions of the Spanish
                            Government upon the conduct of its own officers it shall be
                            conclusive.</p>
                        <p>I desire, in restating their position, to carry the general verbal
                            understanding that the minister of state and myself came to, prior to
                                <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0560"/>the time when I officially
                            transmitted the request, as perhaps making clearer the intent of the
                            language used by the Spanish Government in now officially formulating
                            its conditional compliance.</p>
                        <p>The minister of state, who, I believe, is not technically a lawyer, had
                            given me the idea that all that was desired was that whatever was any
                            judicial decree, or to use his own words “choses jugées,” should be
                            respected; and I explained to him that under our system of jurisprudence
                            there would be no premeditated disturbance of any judicial decision
                            arrived at by any Spanish court having jurisdiction. This, I understand,
                            met his own views.</p>
                        <p>I again venture to commend the close attention of the Department to the
                            scope of this part of the Spanish letter, as it may be intended to
                            include Spanish departmental rulings, etc., together with the decisions
                            of competent tribunals.</p>
                        <p>I have, etc.,</p>

                            <p>Before the receipt of your letter of the 15th I cabled the Department
                                of State stating that the registration of foreigners was required
                                here after they had presented themselves at their respective
                                consulates, and produced some evidence of their nationality, and
                                asking if I should visé Spanish cedulas of persons born in Cuba and
                                Porto Rico who reside here, and who have left those islands since
                                some years, and have <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0562"/>no
                                evidence of intention to return except their statements. To this
                                telegram I have received no reply.</p>
                            <p>Although the minister informed me that cedulas of Cubans and Porto
                                Ricans should be viséed in accordance with instructions to the
                                legation No. 283 of January 16, 1901, before acting on this
                                information, I considered it best to clear up the point that still
                                remains doubtful in my mind mentioned in my letter to the legation
                                dated November 14, 1900, and therefore cabled the Department.</p>
                            <p>It would seem that Spaniards born in the peninsula are just as much
                                entitled to have their cedulas viséed as persons born in Cuba or
                                Porto Rico who have lived here since before the signing of the
                                treaty of peace, but if for some reason the Government wish to
                                recognize these people and visé their cedulas, that visé in my
                                opinon should represent something, as it does on American
                                passports.</p>
                            <p>Those persons who have produced Cuban and Porto Rican passports
                                viséed by this consulate-general have been permitted to
                                register.</p>
                            <p>As the Department instructions say nothing about viséing the
                                certificates inclosed, although they may be accepted as sufficient
                                evidence in Cuba of citizenship for a passport, I have refused to
                                visé them.</p>
                            <p>It occurs to me that there has been a misunderstanding from the first
                                as to what a cedula is in reality, and the Department is under the
                                impression that it is a Cuban or Porto Rican document. I can not
                                imagine how the treaty of peace has changed the status of any except
                                inhabitants of Cuba and Porto Rico or why we should regard natives
                                of Cuba or Porto Rico residing in Spain except as Spaniards. I have
                                treated them as such here, and I know there would be a protest if a
                                visé for which I am obliged to charge an official fee of $1 was
                                found to be worthless.</p>
                            <p>I have, etc.,</p>

                        <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0564"/>
                        <p>The consul appeared before the competent authorities asking their aid in
                            arresting the sailor deserters, as customary in all ports; but the said
                            authorities refused to grant the request of the consul, on the ground
                            that there was no existing treaty between Spain and the United States
                            that could be invoked to effect the arrest he desired.</p>
                        <p>Those authorities acted, no doubt, according to their strict right. There
                            are, it is true, no treaties existing between the two countries, but
                            your excellency knows that the abnormal situation which such a
                            circumstance may create has been in many and various cases remedied by a
                            spirit of mutual courtesy through which, even without signature of
                            treaty, transactions are allowed and of common occurrence among friendly
                            nations. Such is the present instance.</p>
                        <p>The injury which would result from the prevalence of the opinion of the
                            Federal authorities of New Orleans to the navigation and commerce of
                            both countries can not be truly estimated. The sailors of merchant
                            vessels could desert with impunity, and the contracts of their masters
                            would become a dead letter, while there would be no legal means of
                            punishing the guilty.</p>
                        <p>In view of these considerations I would be much obliged to your
                            excellency if you will kindly state to me what is your opinion on so
                            important a subject, and if there will not be means in the future, until
                            the execution of treaties which will certainly contain clauses governing
                            such cases, of avoiding the impunity remaining to deserters from the
                            mercantile marine.</p>

                            there is not some means, pending the consideration of a new treaty, to
                            avoid the exemption from punishment of deserters from Spanish vessels in
                            the United States, with particular reference to the recent desertion of

                            further that in the act approved December 2, 1898, Congress formally
                            repealed the laws then existing which authorized the arrest of deserters
                            from vessels of the United States in ports in this country.</p>

                            legation has received, through the consulate-general at Barcelona, the
                            duplicate application for the granting of a passport to Mr. José
                            Portusach.</p>
                        <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0565"/>
                        <p>The applications, which are for himself, his wife, and his four minor
                            children, have been made out on the theory that the applicant, on
                            account of his having been born in the island of Guam in May, 1859, is
                            now a native-born American citizen.</p>
                        <p>The applications also recite that his family is temporarily sojourning at
                            Barcelona, and is the bearer of a temporary passport issued by the
                            governor of Guam in the month of August last, bearing the seal of the
                            executive office, and signed by the governor’s adjutant, Pressly.</p>
                        <p>He desires this for the purpose of traveling, and intends to return to
                            the United States—that is to say, to the island of Guam—within one year.
                            The passport issued by the governor of Guam is inclosed, and also
                            certain correspondence between the governor of Guam, Commander
                            Schroeder, and Major Jones, quartermaster, which fully identifies the
                            applicant.</p>
                        <p>I am in doubt, first, whether the island of Guam stands under the
                            instruction of the Department regarding the certification of passports
                            or cedulas hailing from the Philippine Islands; second, I am in doubt
                            whether, being born in Guam, he thereby becomes a native-born citizen of
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>I respectfully ask the instructions of the Department whether I shall
                            proceed to issue a passport or shall content myself with legalizing in
                            the usual form, by visa, the passport issued by the governor of Guam,
                            and if I am to issue a passport, whether it should be issued to him as a
                            native-born citizen of the United States or not.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I inclose copies of two letters from Mr.
                            Ole J. Vaule, of Crookston, Minn., who has asked the Department to
                            obtain redress from <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0568"/>the
                            Government of Norway for Johannes P. Hoiland, a naturalized American
                            citizen, for alleged unlawful arrest and imprisonment.</p>
                        <p>The facts, as stated, appear to be as follows:</p>
                        <p>Hoiland was born in Norway, December 23, 1861, and emigrated to the
                            United States in April, 1883, when he was 21 years and 4 months old. He
                            was naturalized in the United States in March, 1896. In December, 1897,
                            he returned to Norway for a visit; in November, 1898, he was notified
                            that he had been fined 20 kroner for failure to be present at a military
                            meeting, and informed that he could not return to America until the fine
                            was paid. He refused to pay the fine, on the ground that he was a
                            citizen of the United States and did not have to do military duty in
                            Norway. On June 7, 1898, he was arrested for declining to drill as a
                            soldier and held under arrest until the next day, when he was released.
                            In August, 1899, it seems that proceedings in regard to the fine were
                            taken in the courts, by which it is said the fine was raised to 32
                            kroner, but on appeal by Hoiland to the supreme court the judgment of
                            the lower court was, on March 8, 1900, reversed on the ground that
                            Hoiland was a citizen of the United States and had duly notified the
                            authorities of his intention to emigrate. - He was permitted to leave
                            Norway, which he did on March 17, 1900.</p>
                        <p>It seems that Hoiland had no written emigration permit, but it is said
                            that under the laws of Norway a written permit was not necessary, as he
                            was at the time of his emigration only 21 years and 4 months old. It is
                            also said that at the time of his emigration Hoiland had not drawn lot
                            as to whether he should belong to the regular army or to the reserves,
                            and under the laws of Norway one may, before he has drawn such lot,
                            emigrate upon a mere notice to the commissioner of his district or
                            parish of his intention to do so. An alleged original statement from one
                            who was formerly such commissioner is transmitted to the Department, in
                            which it is stated that Hoiland notified him of his intention to
                            emigrate to America.</p>
                        <p>Under the naturalization treaty in force between the two countries, a
                            former Norwegian who has emigrated after he has attained the age when he
                            becomes liable to military service and returns again to his original
                            country, is liable to trial and punishment for an act punishable by the
                            laws of Norway and committed before his emigration.</p>
                        <p>The Department would be pleased to have you investigate the case and
                            report the facts ascertained by you.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: April 30 last past I wrote you to the
                                effect that one Johannes Hoiland, a citizen of this country, went to
                                Norway for a visit in 1898 (it should have been 1897) and was by the
                                authorities of that country arrested, fined, and detained over there
                                for a couple of years for refusing to do military duty in that
                                country, and that he desired your office to intercede in his behalf
                                to obtain redress from the Government of Norway for the grievances
                                he has sustained, and asked you to let us know how you wanted the
                                case presented.</p>
                            <p>May 7, 1900, you wrote me to the effect that before you would comply
                                with my request, you wanted to know Holland’s age when he emigrated
                                to the United States, <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0569"/>and
                                that you also wanted a copy of his naturalization papers, and also
                                of his military permit.</p>
                            <p>The reason I did not answer your letter before is that we have been
                                expecting from the authorities in Norway the original military
                                permit, together with his naturalization papers and other papers
                                that were had from Hoiland in the courts of that country. These
                                papers have not yet arrived, but I inclose you herewith another copy
                                of his naturalization papers, and for the present will state that
                                the permit was regular, and accepted as such by the authorities of
                                Norway while Hoiland was detained there as stated.</p>
                            <p>Hoiland emigrated from Norway April 14, 1883, then 21 years and 4
                                months of age; he became a citizen of the United States on March 25,
                                1896; December 11, 1897, he went back to Norway for a visit;
                                November 2, 1898, he was notified by an officer that he had been
                                fined 20 kroner for failing to be present at a military meeting, and
                                was by the same officer at that time notified that he could not
                                return to America until the fine was paid. He refused to pay the
                                fine on the ground that he was a citizen of the United States and
                                did not have to do military duty in Norway; November 29, 1898, the
                                same officer came and borrowed Holland’s naturalization paper and
                                retained same to December 17, 1898, at which time the naturalization
                                paper was returned and a paper served on Hoiland to the effect that
                                he was to stand trial in regard to that fine. The authorities did
                                not bring that case to trial until August 25, 1899. Meanwhile
                                Hoiland was, on June 7, 1899, taken to a military camp and kept
                                under arrest from 3 o’clock in the afternoon of June 7 until 12
                                o’clock noon of June 8, 1899, at which time he was ordered released
                                from arrest by the oberst (colonel).</p>
                            <p>In regard to that fine, it was by the lower court affirmed and
                                increased to 32 kroner, but on appeal the judgment was reversed by
                                the supreme court March 8, 1900, and Hoiland permitted to leave
                                Norway and did leave March 17, 1900.</p>
                            <p>When the military permit arrives I will forward it to you, as well as
                                any other papers you may desire in this matter. Kindly let me hear
                                from you at your earliest opportunity.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In regard to the claim of Johannes P.
                                Hoiland for having been unlawfully detained by the authorities of
                                Norway, and which claim has been heretofore referred to in my
                                letters of April 30, June 9, and June 29, 1900, I will say that I
                                have investigated the case in regard to his military permit referred
                                to in your letter of June 15, 1900, and find that he had no “written
                                permit;” and it appears that, under the laws of Norway, no such
                                written permit was necessary for him, as he was, at the time of his
                                emigration, only 21 years and 4 months old. He was born December 23,
                                1861, and emigrated from Stavanger, Norway, April 14, 1883.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hoiland became a citizen of the United States, as shown by the
                                copy of his naturalization papers, forwarded to you in my letter of
                                June 9, 1900. Thereafter, and on December 11, 1897, he returned to
                                Norway for a visit. November 2, 1898, he was notified that he was
                                fined 20 kroner for failing to be present at a military meeting, and
                                was from then on prevented by the authorities from returning to
                                America. June 7, 1899, he was taken to Malde, a military camp near
                                Stavanger, Norway, arrested for not wanting to drill as a soldier,
                                and kept under arrest from June 7 at 3 p. m. to June 8 at 12 m., at
                                which time the oberst ordered his release.</p>
                            <p>The casein regard to the fine was then taken up by the courts and the
                                fine was raised to 32 kroner, and he was again notified that he
                                could not return to America until the fine was paid. Hoiland
                                appealed to the supreme court of the Kingdom of Norway, where the
                                judgment of the lower court was reversed on the ground that he was a
                                citizen of the United States and that he had duly notified the
                                authorities of his intention to emigrate, and he was permitted to
                                embark March 8, 1900.</p>
                            <p>At the time of his emigration Hoiland had not drawn lot as to whether
                                he should belong to the regular army or to the reserves, and under
                                the laws of Norway one may before he has drawn such lot emigrate
                                upon a mere notice to the commissioner of his district or parish of
                                his intention to do so. I inclose herewith an original statement
                                from Soren Westlye, dated June 22, 1901, who was such commissioner
                                at the time of Holland’s emigration in 1863, and a translation
                                attached to same. It <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0570"/>may
                                also be mentioned that this statement is in substance the same as
                                the statement presented by Hoiland to the courts of Norway and on
                                which he was acquitted.</p>
                            <p>If there is anything else I can do in this connection kindly let me
                                know.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your instruction No. 118, of
                            August 20 last, setting forth the case of Johannes P. Hoiland, a
                            naturalized American citizen, born in Norway, who. had asked the
                            Department to obtain redress from the Government of Norway for alleged
                            unlawful arrest and imprisonment, I have the honor to inform you that in
                            compliance with your directions I at once, on September 3, addressed a
                            note to the minister for foreign affairs, a copy of which herewith
                            inclosed, giving the facts in the case as detailed in your instruction,
                            and requesting to be informed of the attitude of the Government of
                            Norway in the premises.</p>
                        <p>I am now in receipt of a note from the foreign office, dated December 27,
                            a copy of which, accompanied by a translation, is inclosed, transmitting
                            copy of a letter from the minister of the interior of Norway, which I
                            inclose in English translation.</p>
                        <p>In this letter his excellency Mr. Steen gives a full and exhaustive
                            history of the case, from which it appears that Hoiland, after his
                            return to Norway, in December, 1897, was enrolled for military service
                            and notified to appear at the recruit school at Maldesletten on May 2,
                            1899.</p>
                        <p>He did not appear; neither did he prove to the proper military
                            authorities who had ordered him to appear that he was an American
                            citizen.</p>
                        <p>On his not appearing, the commander of the company (captain) at the
                            recruit school charged the sheriff at Time, in May, 1899, to visit
                            Hoiland in person and demand his explanation as to the reason for his
                            absence, and to request him to produce his American citizenship papers
                            as proof in case he had such papers. Hoiland told the sheriff that he
                            was an American citizen, but refused to produce or show the military
                            authorities his citizen papers; he said he had shown them to the police
                            in connection with the fine case, and he would not now show them to any
                            more Norwegian authorities.</p>
                        <p>It was after this that Hoiland, on June 7, 1899, was transported to the
                            Malde drilling grounds and placed under arrest. The next day, June 8, he
                            showed his American citizen papers, after which he was immediately
                            released.</p>
                        <p>The opinion is expressed that Hoiland has only himself to blame for his
                            arrest and imprisonment, since these were caused by his default to <pb
                                n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0571"/>show his American citizen
                            papers on request by the proper military authorities.</p>
                        <p>It is also held that, although the treaty between the United States and
                            Sweden and Norway of May 26, 1869, protects naturalized American
                            citizens of Norwegian birth returning to Norway from military service,
                            unless they again become domiciled in Norway, it is nevertheless
                            incumbent on such Norwegian emigrants to prove themselves to be American
                            citizens whenever officially requested to do so by the proper Norwegian
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>In fact, that if such persons have the right to be free from military
                            service because they are American citizens, they have also the duty laid
                            upon them of proving such citizenship.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I beg to call your attention to the printed notice
                            issued by the Department of State and given to naturalized American
                            citizens of Norwegian birth on their applying for a passport.</p>
                        <p>Paragraphs 3 and 4 of this notice read as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>A naturalized American who performed his military service or
                                    emigrated when he was not liable to it, and who infracted no
                                    laws before emigrating, may safely return to Norway.</p>
                                <p>He must, however, report to the conscription officers, and, on
                                    receiving a summons, present himself at the meetings of the
                                    conscripts in order to prove his American citizenship.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It would seem that if Hoiland had acted in accordance with the plain and
                            wise advice given by the Department he would have saved himself all the
                            trouble of which he complains.</p>

                                United States in April, 1883, when he was 21 years and 4 months old.
                                He was naturalized in the United States in March, 1896. In December,
                                1897, he returned to Norway for a visit; in November, 1898, he was
                                notified that he had been fined 20 kroner for failure to be present
                                at a military meeting, and informed that he could not return to
                                America until the fine was paid. He refused to pay the fine on the
                                ground that he was a citizen of the United States and did not have
                                to do military duty in Norway. On June 7, 1899, he was arrested for
                                declining to drill as a soldier and held under arrest until the next
                                day, when he was released. In August, 1899, it seems that
                                proceedings in regard to the fine were taken in the courts, by which
                                it is said the fine was raised to 32 kroner, but on appeal by
                                Hoiland to the supreme court, the judgment of the lower court was on
                                March 8, 1900, reversed on the ground that Hoiland was a citizen of
                                the United States and had duly notified the authorities of his
                                intention to emigrate. He was permitted to leave Norway, which he
                                did on March 17, 1900.</p>
                            <p>It seems that Hoiland had no written emigration permit, but it is
                                said that under the laws of Norway a written permit was not
                                necessary, as he was at the time of his emigration only 21 years and
                                4 months old. It is also said that at the time of his emigration
                                Hoiland had not drawn lot as to whether he should belong to the
                                regular army or to the reserves, and under the laws of Norway one
                                may, before he has drawn such a lot, emigrate upon a mere notice to
                                the commissioner of his district or parish of his intention to do
                                so. An alleged original statement from one who was formerly such
                                commissioner is transmitted to the Department, in which it is stated
                                    <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0572"/>that Hoiland notified
                                him of his intention to emigrate to America. This statement is dated
                                Westlye, June 22, 1901, and signed Soren Westlye, formerly district
                                commissioner.</p>
                            <p>Hoiland emigrated from Stavanger, Norway. The place of his arrest was
                                Malde, a military camp near Stavanger.</p>
                            <p>I should be pleased to be informed of the attitude of the Government
                                of Norway upon this case, with a view of reporting the same to the
                                Department of State.</p>

                            <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: By a note, dated the 3d of
                                October (September) last, you have been pleased to express the
                                desire to be placed in position to report to your Government the
                                attitude of the Government of Norway upon the treatment which
                                Johannes P. Hoiland, an American citizen, has undergone at the hands
                                of the Norwegian authorities on account of his refusal to perform
                                military service in Norway.</p>
                            <p>Having requested the opinion of the competent Norwegian authorities,
                                I have the honor to transmit to you in reply a copy of a letter
                                which the minister of the interior at Christiania has addressed to
                                me, and in which his excellency, Mr. Steen, after having recounted
                                the details of the affairs and in proving that Hoiland has himself
                                caused his arrest by his refusal to legitimate himself as an
                                American citizen, expresses the opinion that an emigrant who, on his
                                return to Norway should, according to the treaty with the United
                                States of May 26, 1869, be free from military service in Norway, has
                                nevertheless the duty of proving his American nationality before the
                                competent authorities.</p>
                            <p>I am convinced that you will concur in this opinion.</p>

                            <p>In a communication of September 10 last the Royal foreign office has
                                transmitted to this department a copy of a note from the American
                                minister at Stockholm, elated September 3, in which information is
                                requested regarding the attitude of the Norwegian Government with
                                respect to the fining and imprisonment of an American citizen,
                                Johannes P. Hoiland, for omitting to appear at the conscription
                                meeting and to present himself for military service in this
                                country.</p>
                            <p>In consequence thereof, after having received the opinion of the war
                                department in the matter and the explanations procured by said
                                department from the competent conscription authorities, we have the
                                honor to state as follows, viz.:</p>
                            <p>It is true, as stated in the American minister’s note, that the said
                                Johannes P. Hoiland was born in this country in 1861, and that he
                                emigrated to America in April, 1883, before the holding of the
                                conscription meeting in his place of domicile (Time district) in the
                                aforesaid year. It is also true, that, according to Nowegian law, it
                                is not required that conscripts who, as was the case with Hoiland,
                                emigrate from the Kingdom before the holding of the conscription
                                meeting in their place of domicile in the calendar year in which
                                they reach the age of 22, shall have express permission to emigrate,
                                but it is sufficient that they, previous to their departure, have
                                made a declaration of their emigration to the alderman
                                (rodeforstander) of their ward and the commissary of their district,
                                and from the latter have received a written certificate that such a
                                declaration has been made.</p>
                            <p>This obligation to make such declaration was, however, not fulfilled
                                by Hoiland. It is true that the American minister has stated that
                                Hoiland has presented a certificate dated June 22, 1901, issued by
                                Soren Westbye, former district commissary, to the effect that
                                Hoiland had made declaration to him of his (Holland’s) emigration
                                before he left the country in April, 1883; but the proper
                                conscription board has now informed <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493"
                                    facs="0573"/>this department that Soren Westbye was not district
                                commissary for Time in 1883 (his time of office as such had already
                                expired the preceding year), and that opposite Holland’s name in the
                                muster roll for his year’s class (which roll is kept by the military
                                roll keeper, who is also the chief of the district commission,
                                registering all young conscripts, from confirmation age up) it is
                                expressly remarked that he had emigrated without proper
                                declaration.</p>
                            <p>The conscript law of February 28, 1877, section 29, provides that
                                every emigrated Norwegian subject who returns to this country must
                                at once report to the proper district commission. This was not
                                observed by Hoiland on his return in December, 1897, and
                                furthermore, he can not be considered in any other way to have
                                informed any Norwegian authority that he had become an American
                                citizen.</p>
                            <p>At the district meeting for Time on April 12, 1898, it was reported
                                to the roll keeper that Hoiland had returned. As a consequence of
                                this, the roll keeper charged the proper alderman (rodeforstander)
                                to call him to appear at the conscription meeting for Time, which
                                was to be held on August 4 of the same year, in order that his
                                conscription duties to Norway might be investigated and determined.
                                It seems, however, as if the alderman (rodeforstander) has neglected
                                thus to call him, and consequently Hoiland did not appear at the
                                conscription meeting. The conscription board, supposing that Hoiland
                                had been called to appear, imposed a fine upon him of 20 kroner for
                                absence, and also enrolled him (as one who had, previous to his
                                departure for America, neglected his declaration duty) for full
                                military service, providing that he, on appearing for drill, should
                                be found serviceable. Hoiland was then informed both of the
                                imposition of the fine and the enrollment.</p>
                            <p>When the imposition of the fine was thereafter brought to his
                                knowledge by the civil authorities, he refused to pay the fine,
                                stating as his reason that he was an American citizen. The Norwegian
                                authorities, supposing that he had been expressly ordered to appear
                                at the conscript meeting to account for his conscript duties and
                                that he, even if he were an American citizen, was obliged, after
                                being ordered, to appear at said function to prove this, then took
                                legal action against him to collect the fine. Hoiland was also
                                sentenced by the inferior court, but the supreme court acquitted him
                                of the imposed fine on March 8, 1900, because it might be supposed,
                                from the evidence then produced, that he had not received any order
                                to appear at the conscription meeting, such as the alderman
                                (rodeforstander) had been charged to serve on him, and because he,
                                after it had been shown that he was an American citizen, was
                                regarded as not obliged to appear without such a special order.</p>
                            <p>As a consequence of the other action against Hoiland, in accordance
                                with the aforesaid decision of the conscription board (his
                                enrollment for military service), he was charged by the proper
                                military authorities to appear at the recruit school at Madesletten
                                on May 2, 1899. He did not appear, however; neither did he prove to
                                the proper military authorities, who had ordered him to appear, that
                                he was an American citizen.</p>
                            <p>On his not appearing, the commander of the company (captain) at the
                                recruit school charged the sheriff at Time, in May, 1899, to visit
                                Hoiland in person and demand his explanation as to the reason for
                                his absence, and to request him to lend his American citizen papers
                                as proof, in case he had such papers. Hoiland told the sheriff that
                                he was an American citizen, but he refused to lend or show the
                                military authorities his citizen papers; he said he had shown them
                                to the police in connection with the fine case, and he would not
                                show them to any more Norwegian authorities.</p>
                            <p>It was after this that Hoiland, on June 7, 1899—thus previous to the
                                aforesaid acquittal by the supreme court of the fine imposed upon
                                him for omitting to appear at the conscription meeting—was
                                transported to the Malde drilling grounds and placed under arrest.
                                The next day, June 8, he showed his American citizen papers, after
                                which he was immediately released.</p>
                            <p>The conscription board has, in connection with this information,
                                remarked that Hoiland may blame himself for being subjected to the
                                treatment of which he has now complained, for if he had shown
                                greater willingness to prove his relation to the United States he
                                would have avoided being arrested.</p>
                            <p>The general war commissary has stated that he must declare himself in
                                unison with this opinion of the conscription board, and has in this
                                connection stated that since the treaty with the United States of
                                May 26, 1869, protects returning emigrants who have become American
                                citizens from conscription unless they again become domiciled here
                                in the Kingdom, it must, in his opinion, be inevitable that such
                                returning emigrants are obliged to prove their American citizenship
                                to every Norwegian authority who officially requires them to do so.
                                Furthermore, the general war commissary has called attention to the
                                fact that Hoiland was acquitted of the fine because it could not be
                                considered proved that he had received any call to appear at the
                                conscription meeting. He had, however, received an order to appear
                                at the opening of the recruit school, on May 2, 1899, and he must
                                therefore submit to being treated as <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494"
                                    facs="0574"/>one obliged to appear, until he, on showing his
                                American citizen papers, prove that he, as an American citizen, had
                                a right to be free.</p>
                            <p>Also the war department has stated that, with respect to the
                                information here given, it finds that Holland’s transportation to
                                the Malde drilling grounds and arrest may be ascribed to his refusal
                                to prove himself not obliged to do military service, the war
                                department, like the general war commissary, presenting as its
                                opinion that returning emigrants, who, in consequence of the treaty
                                with the United States of May 26, 1869, are exempt from conscription
                                in this Kingdom, are obliged to prove themselves to be American
                                citizens whenever this is demanded by the proper Norwegian
                                authorities.</p>
                            <p>This department also finds that it must support this opinion.</p>
                            <p>The American minister in Stockholm should be informed of the
                                foregoing.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that a
                            bronze statue of John Ericsson, the great Swedish-American, erected by
                            national subscription, was unveiled at Stockholm on the 14th instant
                            with imposing ceremonies.</p>
                        <p>The occasion was honored by the presence of His Royal Highness the Crown
                            Prince of Sweden and Norway, Prince Eugene, and Prince Bernadotte, his
                            excellency the minister for foreign affairs, and other members of the
                            Swedish cabinet, the governor of Stockholm, high officers of the Swedish
                            army and navy, members of the Swedish Riksdag, and several hundred other
                            gentlemen and ladies prominent in the political, social, and literary
                            life of Sweden. The entire personnel of the American legation and
                            consulate-general were also present. All were seated upon a raised
                            tribune in front of the monument. About the tribune were gathered a vast
                            multitude of over 20,000 people, who filled the broad place at the head
                            of Nybro Harbor, where the statue stands, in the heart of Stockholm, and
                            overflowed all approaching streets and avenues.</p>
                        <p>All around the park were erected tall flagstaffs, from which floated the
                            American and Swedish flags alternately. Swedish and American flags were
                            also very generally displayed from public and private buildings
                            throughout the entire city and from the shipping in the harbor.</p>
                        <p>At the command of the Crown Prince, “Let the veil fall from the monument
                            of our illustrious countryman, John Ericsson,” the covering fell,
                            disclosing the stately statue.</p>
                        <p>A salute of fifteen guns was fired by the first Swedish monitor, <hi
                                rend="italic">John Ericsson</hi>, lying in the harbor hard by, and
                            the royal naval band blew a flourish of trumpets.</p>
                        <p>It is an interesting fact that the plans for this monitor were all drawn
                            by Ericsson in America and the two great cannon in the turret were
                            procured by Ericsson in the United States and presented by him to
                            Sweden.</p>
                        <p>The monitor now saluted the monument of its creator.</p>
                        <p>Maj. Cl. Adelskiöld, chairman of the monument committee, then delivered
                            an address. He concluded with the following words, addressed to the
                            minister of the United States, which I give in English translation:

                                    Sweden on behalf of the United States Government by the American
                                    minister, Mr. Thomas, whom we still have the pleasure of seeing
                                    in the same high position he then held. And it has been
                                    considered especially appropriate to choose this day, when two
                                    nations joined in honoring the memory of John Ericsson, for the
                                    unveiling of this monument, thereby publicly and before the
                                    whole world affirming the high appreciation which the Swedish
                                    people feel and always will feel for the mark of distinction
                                    which the great Republic accorded Sweden by the honorable manner
                                    in which the earthly remains of one of its most noble sons were
                                    delivered to the fatherland.</p>
                                <p>And I take the liberty of most respectfully requesting your
                                    excellency to bring to the knowledge of your Government, your
                                    countrymen, and the million of John Ericsson’s countrymen who
                                    live in the United States of America the feeling of deepest and
                                    warmest gratitude which the country and people of Sweden will
                                    always bear toward the great Republic on the other side of the
                                    ocean and the pride we feel in this extraordinary mark of
                                    honor.</p>
                                <p>Tell him that, though it was not granted us to have this immortal
                                    man here in our home country during the whole of his lifetime,
                                    we rejoice that he in his new father-erland had opportunity to
                                    develop the rich resources of his genius, thereby making himself
                                    useful to you, to humanity, and to us, and that we, through the
                                    noble-mindedness of your Government, were granted an opportunity
                                    of tenderly caring for his earthly remains, in accordance with
                                    the wish expressed by him.</p>

                        <p>Just before the unveiling of the monument I had received your telegram
                            announcing the death of President McKinley. The members of the legation
                            and consulate-general, both ladies and gentlemen, were therefore all
                            clad in mourning on this occasion. Wearing the symbols of mourning, I
                            then delivered the following address. To this vast Swedish audience I
                            spoke in the Swedish language, but the following is an exact English
                            translation of my words: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">address of mr.

                                <p>It is with a heavy heart I stand here to-day.</p>
                                <p>The sad tidings have just flown over the ocean that America’s
                                    beloved President lies dead in our distant land.</p>
                                <p>But if his dead lips could speak, full well I know they would say
                                    to me:</p>
                                <p>“Do your duty. Let not my death cause America to be unrepresented
                                    to-day, when Sweden honors the memory of the great
                                    Swedish-American who at a critical moment in America’s history
                                    rendered the Republic illustrious service and saved her from
                                    great peril.”</p>
                                <p>Eleven years ago this September day, on board the American
                                    man-of-war <hi rend="italic">Baltimore</hi>, lying in
                                    Stockholm’s harbor, it fell to me, representing my country, to
                                    deliver to Sweden the honored ashes of John Ericsson.</p>
                                <p>And now to-day it is my privilege to be present at the dedication
                                    of this monument, which has been erected to Ericsson’s honor in
                                    Sweden’s capital.</p>
                                <p>To participate in this celebration I esteem not only an honor but
                                    a duty, for John Ericsson belongs to America as well as to
                                    Sweden. True, here was his fatherland, but the broad field of
                                    his activity was in the New World beyond the western wave, and
                                    there lay the scene of his great achievements.</p>
                                <p>These achievements have materially aided the progress of the
                                    world, for Ericsson was a true laborer for the development and
                                    civilization of mankind, but his most illustrious service
                                    rendered to his adopted country will ever merit special
                                    recognition.</p>
                                <p>We Americans will never forget our great war for the Union, which
                                    freed 4,000,000 slaves and saved our nation’s life.</p>
                                <p>We will never forget one bright spring morning when the rebel ram
                                        <hi rend="italic">Merrimac</hi> steamed out of Norfolk
                                    Harbor and with her prow of iron bore down upon our fleet of
                                    wooden vessels lying at anchor in Hampton Roads; or how that
                                    monster ironclad rammed and destroyed, one after the other, our
                                    bravest ships, broke our blockade, and for a few short hours was
                                    mistress of the seas.</p>
                                <p>We will never forget how the little <hi rend="italic"
                                        >Monitor</hi>, as if sent by Providence, suddenly appeared
                                    upon the scene, attacked the colossus of the slave power, as
                                    David did Goliath, and how, after a hard-fought duel, the little
                                    Union ship defeated its giant adversary, and thus saved our
                                    navy, our blockade, and our power on the ocean.</p>
                                <p>We will never forget either that the man whose genius invented
                                    and built and gave us the <hi rend="italic">Monitor</hi> was no
                                    native American, but the Swede, John Ericsson, born and bred in
                                    this ancient, honored land.</p>
                                <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0577"/>
                                <p>America will always owe a debt of gratitude to Sweden, which has
                                    given us a million of our best citizens, each one a link in the
                                    golden chain which binds together two great and kindred peoples
                                    in the bonds of friendship and good will; but our deepest
                                    gratitude is due because Sweden gave us that man whose memory we
                                    to-day are met to honor, and who has justly won the proud title
                                    of the Great Swedish-American.</p>
                                <p>And America will never forget her debt. In the New World we have
                                    raised monuments to the memory of John Ericsson in imperishable
                                    bronze. We have inscribed his name in our Pantheon of the
                                    Republic’s immortal heroes. We have sent his earthly remains
                                    home to fatherland with greatest honors the nation can bestow.
                                    And on this day, when the veil falls from the statue which shall
                                    here perpetuate the memory of his life and deeds, our hearts
                                    beat in unison with yours in thanksgiving for the great man whom
                                    two nations rejoice to call their own.</p>

                        <p>I may be permitted to add that the address was received by gratifying
                            manifestations of approbation, for which the signal was given by the
                            Crown Prince. His Royal Highness also publicly arose and, taking my

                            of exceptional import and interest took place yesterday at Stockholm and
                            Christiania.</p>
                        <p>December 10, 1901, was the fifth anniversary of the death of Alfred
                            Bernard Nobel, the great Swedish engineer and inventor, and on yesterday
                            were awarded for the first time the prizes instituted by him in his
                            testament to those persons who have contributed most materially to
                            benefit mankind in the domains of physics, chemistry, medicine,
                            literature, and in the works of peace.</p>
                        <p>The prizes were awarded as follows: In physics, to Wilhelm Conrad
                            Rontgen, professor at the University at Munich, the discoverer of the
                            Rontgen rays; in chemistry, to Jacobus Henricus Van’t Hoff, professor at
                            the University of Berlin; in medicine, to Emil von Behring, professor at
                            Halle, the discoverer of the diphtheria serums; in literature, to
                            Sulty-Prudhomme, member of the French Academy; in the works of peace,
                            this prize was divided in two, and awarded in equal parts to Henri
                            Dunant, of Switzerland, the leading spirit in bringing about the Geneva
                            convention and in instituting the Societies of the Red Cross, and to
                            Frederick Passy, national economist, of France.</p>
                        <p>The first four prizes were given out at Stockholm with impressive
                            ceremonies. The place was the grand hall of the Royal Academy of Music,
                            which was tastefully decorated. This spacious hall was filled with a
                            brilliant gathering of gentlemen and ladies, the leaders in Swedish
                            science, literature, art, and public life, and the occasion was
                            especially honored by the presence of the Crown Prince and other members
                            of the royal family.</p>
                        <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0578"/>
                        <p>The exercises were enlivened by addresses appropriate to the event, and
                            by music and song. The prize diplomas were given out by the Crown Prince
                            in person and were received in person by Professors Rontgen, van’t Hoff,
                            and Behring.</p>
                        <p>As M. Sully-Prudhomme was unable to be present on account of sickness,
                            the diploma in literature was delivered to the minister for France at
                            Stockholm, to be forwarded by him to M. Sully-Prudhomme.</p>
                        <p>On the same day the prize in the works of peace, divided in two parts, as
                            above mentioned, was awarded to M. Dunant and M. Passy at Christiania by
                            the Norwegian Storting convened in solemn session.</p>
                        <p>Each of the five prizes is for the sum of over 150,000 crowns (150,782.23
                            crowns exactly), or more than $40,000—an amount sufficient of itself to
                            place each recipient in independent circumstances, and to permit him
                            untrammeled to pursue his investigations and life work, which have
                            already been of so great benefit.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, five prizes of like, or perhaps greater, amount will be
                            awarded every year on December 10 hereafter forever.</p>
                        <p>I think it may be said that these prizes, in kind as well as in amount,
                            are unparalleled in the history of science, literature, and humanity,
                            and that the day these prizes were for the first time awarded marks an
                            epoch in the advance of the human race.</p>
                        <p>Alfred Nobel directed that substantially the whole of his vast fortune be
                            used for the benefit of mankind. Though the discoverer of dynamite, he
                            instituted one of his grand prizes for the works of peace. His
                            beneficence is as broad as humanity. He was more than patriot; he was
                            the friend of the human race. In his last will he directs that in
                            awarding the prizes no consideration whatever be paid to nationality,
                            but that the worthiest be awarded the prize, whether he is Scandinavian
                            or not.</p>
                        <p>Peace to his ashes. His great and enduring work reflects honor upon
                            himself and upon the race from which he sprung.</p>

                                citizens of switzerland who contemplate returning to that
                                country.</hi></p>
                        <p>The information given below is believed to be correct, yet is not to be
                            considered as official, as it relates to the laws and regulations of a
                            foreign country.</p>
                        <p>Every Swiss citizen is liable, under Swiss law, to military service from
                            the beginning of the year in which he becomes 20 years of age until the
                            end of the year when he becomes 44. Every Swiss of military age who does
                            not perform military service is subject to an annual tax, whether he
                            resides in the Confederation or not, or to punishment for nonpayment of
                            the tax if he returns to Switzerland.</p>
                        <p>If a Swiss citizen renounces Swiss allegiance in the manner prescribed by
                            the Swiss law of July 3, 1876, and his renunciation is accepted, his
                            naturalization in another country is recognized, but without such
                            acceptance it is not recognized, and is held to descend from generation
                            to generation.</p>
                        <p>Before he returns to Switzerland an American citizen of Swiss origin
                            should file with the cantonal authorities his written declaration of
                            renunciation of his rights to communal, cantonal, and in general Swiss
                            citizenship, with documents showing that he has obtained foreign
                            citizenship for himself, wife, and minor children, and receive the
                            sealed document of release from Swiss citizenship through the direction
                            of justice of the canton of his origin. If he neglects this and is
                            within the ages when military service may be required, he is liable to
                            military tax, or to arrest and punishment in case of nonpayment of the
                            tax.</p>
                        <p>There is no treaty between the United States and Switzerland defining the
                            status of former Swiss citizens who have become naturalized as American
                            citizens.</p>
                        <p>Passports are not required for admission to Switzerland, but are usually
                            demanded from persons sojourning in that country. They do not require to
                            be viséed or indorsed to be valid.</p>

                            Convention, being in the English and French languages, is, as amended by
                            the Senate of the United States, word for word as follows:</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States of America and the Federal Council of
                            the Swiss Confederation, with a view to the better administration of

                            of fugitive criminals, and, for that purpose, have appointed as their
                            Plenipotentiaries, to wit:</p>
                        <p>The President of the United States of America: John Hay, Secretary of

                            hereinafter in Article II, committed in the territory of one of the

                            Provided that this shall be done by the United States only upon such
                            evidence of criminality as, according to the laws of the place where the
                            fugitive or person shall be found, would justify his apprehension and
                            commitment for trial if the crime or offense had been there committed.
                            In Switzerland the surrender shall be made in accordance with the laws

                            which your excellency was pleased to address to me on the 19th ultimo,
                            relative to the <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0585"/>request
                            presented by Dr. A. Cérésole and Mr. A. du Souchet, Swiss citizens, to
                            Mr. Long, agent and consul-general of the United States at Cairo, to
                            have their names enrolled at the office of the said consulate-general,
                            with a view to enjoying its protection, if necessary, I hasten herewith
                            to communicate to you the reply which I have just received from my
                            Government on this subject.</p>
                        <p>The circular of the Federal Council of July 8, 1871, a copy of which your
                            excellency will find herewith, states the point of view of my Government
                            on the subject of the protection of Swiss citizens in countries where
                            Switzerland has no diplomatic or consular representatives. It appears
                            from this circular that in 1871 my Government and the Government of the
                            United States of America agreed that the latter should instruct its
                            representatives in foreign countries to take under their protection any
                            Swiss citizen who desired it, without the necessity of a previous
                            understanding between the two Governments in each particular case.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Fish addressed a circular, under date of June 16, 1871, to the
                            representatives of the United States in foreign countries (see <ref
                                target="frus1871#pg_28">Foreign Relations of the United States for
                                1871, p. 28</ref>) authorizing them to extend their protection to
                            Swiss citizens with the consent of the authorities of the country in
                            which they resided.</p>
                        <p>The contents of the aforesaid note of your excellency have given rise to
                            a doubt in the mind of my Government whether the instructions given by
                            Mr. Fish have since then been modified. I should therefore be grateful
                            to your excellency if you would inform me on this point.</p>
                        <p>My Government apprises me, moreover, that it will not hesitate to support
                            the request of the aforesaid gentlemen on condition that they themselves
                            lay their request before the Federal Council. Messrs. Cérésole and du
                            Souchet must also be informed that the representatives of the United
                            States are not authorized by their Government, according to the view set
                            forth by the Department of State, to assert the claims of foreigners
                            officially, and that they must confine themselves to lending, when
                            necessary, their personal and unofficial good offices.</p>
                        <p>In having the honor to bring the foregoing to your excellency’s notice,
                            and awaiting such further communications as you may be pleased to make
                            to me on this subject, I avail, etc.,</p>

                                consular officers of the Confederation.]</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Petitions have several times been
                                presented to us by Swiss citizens or commercial firms established in
                                countries where Switzerland has neither diplomatic officers nor
                                consuls, asking for our intervention with this or that foreign power
                                with a view to securing its consular protection for them.</p>
                            <p>In one case of this kind, the legation of Germany at Berne remarked
                                that it would be much easier and more expeditious to avoid, by a
                                general measure, the correspondence that has hitherto been necessary
                                in each particular case, and suggested that this matter should be
                                settled once for all. It declared, furthermore, that the Imperial
                                Government was prepared to issue general instructions to its
                                diplomatic <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0586"/>and consular
                                officers to grant, in places where there were no official
                                representatives of the Confederation, their protection to such Swiss
                                citizens as should make application therefor.</p>
                            <p>We accepted this offer of the German Government, declaring, however,
                                that we did not desire thereby to compel Swiss citizens in foreign
                                countries to place themselves under the consular protection of
                                Germany, or even specially to recommend them to apply for such
                                protection.</p>
                            <p>Similar negotiations having been held between the president of the
                                Confederation and the United States legation at Berne, the American
                                Government issued to its diplomatic and consular agents general
                                instructions identical with those issued by the Imperial German
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>In informing you of these arrangements, we would remark that it is
                                understood that none but those localities are concerned in which
                                there are no official representatives of the Confederation, and that
                                a Swiss citizen can in nowise be permitted to renounce the
                                protection of the consul of his country in order to have recourse to
                                that of a foreign consul, nor can the latter be permitted to grant
                                him his protection before it has been asked for.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, we repeat: Although a general measure of this kind has
                                been accepted by us, it has only been with a view to avoiding a long
                                correspondence in each particular case, and in order to guarantee
                                efficient protection to Swiss citizens when it is impossible for the
                                Confederation to furnish such protection to them directly, through
                                its own agents.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of
                            your note of the 23d ultimo, relative to the cases of Dr. Edouard
                            Cérésole and Mr. A. du Souchet, citizens of the Swiss Republic, residing
                            at Alexandria and Cairo, respectively, and to the willingness of the
                            Government of the United States to authorize its agents to exert their
                            personal and unofficial good offices in their behalf in case of
                            necessity, should this be agreeable to the Swiss Government.</p>
                        <p>You cite the circular of June 16, 1871 (<ref target="frus1871#pg_28"
                                >Foreign Relations, 1871, pp. 28</ref>, <ref target="frus1871#pg_29"
                                >29</ref>), as an agreement between the two Governments, by which
                            the United States undertook the protection of Swiss citizens, with the
                            consent of the authorities of the country in which they resided, without
                            the necessity of a previous understanding between the United States and
                            Switzerland in each particular case. You accordingly inquire whether the
                            instructions of Mr. Fish, at the time Secretary of State, have been
                            modified, since the inquiry in Mr. Hay’s note of April 19, 1901, No.
                            291, would appear to indicate in the mind of the Swiss Government a
                            doubt upon the subject.</p>
                        <p>By reference to the Department’s note to your legation of July 1, 1887
                            (Mr. Bayard to Mr. Kloss, <ref target="frus1887#pg_1076">Foreign

                                >1077</ref>), you will find it specifically stated in what manner
                            representatives of the United States may be permitted to employ their
                            good offices for the protection of an alien in those countries where his
                            Government maintains neither a diplomatic nor consular officer. The
                            views of this Government have not undergone a change from those <pb
                                n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0587"/>expressed in the note to Mr.
                            Kloss. In Mr. Frey’s note of October 24, 1887 (<ref

                                    scope of the relation between the protecting State and persons
                                    committed to its protection, it has nevertheless been glad to be
                                    informed, in a definite manner, by your note what your

                        <p>The Federal Council, you will recall, considered the matter as settled,
                            and returned its thanks for the willingness of this Government to
                            authorize the consular representatives of the United States to use their
                            good offices in behalf of Swiss citizens, “of which kindness the Federal
                            Council proposes to avail itself, if there shall be any necessity
                            therefor.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hay’s note was intended to inform your Government that Dr. Cérésole
                            and Mr. du Souchet had appealed for the protection of this Government,
                            and that Mr. Long was willing to grant the use of his unofficial good
                            offices in their behalf, if permitted by the Egyptian authorities.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I note your statement that the Swiss Government will
                            not hesitate to support the request of these gentlemen “on condition
                            that they themselves lay their request before the Federal Council.”</p>
                        <p>If it shall, therefore, be the desire of the Swiss Confederation, permit
                            me to assure you that it will be the pleasure of the Government of the

                            the case arising, as explained in its note of July 1, 1887.</p>
                        <p>Awaiting your further reply, and adding that the agent and consul-general
                            of the United States at Cairo will be given copies of this

                        <p>In reply to the note you addressed to Mr. Pioda, under date of June 15
                            last, in regard to the protection to be granted by the representatives
                            of the United States to two Swiss citizens, Messrs. Cérésole and Du
                            Souchet, I am instructed by my Government to thank you for the kind
                            dispositions you have been pleased once more to evince toward Swiss
                            citizens who might apply for protection to diplomatic or consular agents
                            of the United States of America in countries where Switzerland is not
                            represented.</p>
                        <p>The Federal Council leaves each one of its citizens who may settle in a
                            country where the Confederation has no diplomatic or consular agent
                            entirely free to place himself under the protection of such power as he
                            sees fit, and has therefore no objection to the representatives of the
                            United States at Cairo and at Alexandria being instructed to comply <pb
                                n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0588"/>with the request of Dr. E.
                            Cérésole and A. du Souchet and to enter their names in their list of
                            protégés.</p>
                        <p>Yet, as the protection afforded by the United States of America to Swiss
                            citizens is confined, when granted, to extending to them their
                            unofficial good offices, while Germany and other powers make absolutely
                            no distinction, in this connection, between the Swiss protégés and their
                            own people, it would be desirable that in each individual case Swiss
                            citizens who apply for the protection of the United States of America be
                            expressly warned of the fact that the protection of representatives of
                            the United States is limited, and particularly that the latter are under
                            no circumstances permitted to intervene officially in their behalf with
                            the authorities of the country to which they are accredited.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Honored Sir</hi>: On September 16, 1881, I
                                sailed from New York for China via Suez Canal. Before leaving New
                                York I left an application for a passport, and wrote to my mother,
                                Sherrard, Marshall County, W. Va., to send to the State Department
                                my father’s naturalization papers. She did so, and Hon. J. G.
                                Blaine, then Secretary of State, issued a passport which was sent to
                                me in Bremen, Germany.</p>
                            <p>Since then I have been a missionary of the Methodist Episcopal
                                Church. The years 1889 and 1890 I spent in the United States, also a
                                part of last year, 1900. Last August I brought my family to Zürich,
                                Switzerland, and applied to the United States minister, through the
                                consul at Zürich, for a passport for Switzerland. With my
                                application I sent to the minister my old passport issued by Mr.
                                Blaine, a Chinese passport issued by the United States minister to
                                China, also a consular certificate of the births of our children,
                                and my own birth certificate. But the minister refused to give me a
                                passport for Switzerland, insisting that I must furnish the
                                naturalization papers of my father. The old papers having long since
                                been lost, I wrote to Moundsville, the county seat of Marshall
                                County, W. Va., asking the clerk to send me a copy of my father’s
                                naturalization papers. Before an answer came I was called by cable
                                to return to China, and when the answer came from the clerk it
                                proved to be only a statement that Carl G. Kupfer (my father) had
                                upon a certain date called at the office and applied for his
                                naturalization papers. Upon this the minister again refused to give
                                my family a passport; and the authorities in Zürich are giving my
                                family no little trouble. It is only through the consul’s kind aid
                                that they have been able to remain in Zürich. My wife has written
                                again to Moundsville, but can get no reply. While I was in
                                Switzerland I went twice from Zürich to Berne to see the minister,
                                but neither time did I find him at home. His secretary, a Swiss, who
                                was in charge, had the audacity to tell me that I was no longer an
                                American citizen, having been out of the country for more than
                                twelve years.</p>
                            <p>In this distress for the peace of my family, may I trouble you to
                                kindly send, at an early convenience, a record of my first passport
                                to the minister at Berne, that my family may no longer be harassed
                                by the authorities of Zürich. I shall be greatly obliged.</p>

                            Canton, Switzerland, and now works there as a fireman in the

                                facs="0590"/>Grenion, of that place. License for the marriage was
                            granted by the chief of police of the Fribourg Canton under the circular
                            of the Federal Council of July 19, 1887, upon production of the American
                            passport, about whose validity there was no room for doubt. Eight
                            children, one of whom, the girl, Albertine Felicie, died on November 20,
                            1892, were born of this marriage. Stolz again secured a renewal of his
                            passport by the legation in 1889, and for the last time on November 9,
                            1891, but in 1893, when he personally called at the legation for a third
                            renewal, the last passport was there purely and simply canceled, and
                            Stolz was told that under the laws of the country he must again take up
                            his domicile in America if he meant to remain a citizen of the United
                            States. Now, it was impossible for him to comply with that
                            requirement.</p>
                        <p>In 1897 the Fribourg authorities renewed steps, either at the consulate
                            of the United States at Geneva or the legation at Berne, but in vain, as
                            shown by the letters annexed to the record, which I have the honor to
                            inclose herewith.</p>
                        <p>Stolz was then called upon to regularize his status and took steps toward
                            acquiring Swiss citizenship. On the 27th of June, 1898, he received from
                            the high Federal Council the requisite authority for that purpose, but
                            failed to find within the statutory term any commune that would accept
                            him as a burgher, not, as he alleges in his petition, on religious
                            grounds, but solely because of his scanty means and the burden of his
                            large family. About the beginning of the year 1900 Mr. Stolz was granted
                            by the chief of police of Fribourg a last term of one year in which to
                            set himself right, either by producing valid papers or by furnishing
                            adequate bail as a guaranty of the consequences of his illegal residence
                            in the Fribourg Canton. The term has expired, and Stolz’s status remains
                            unchanged. He is unable to meet the required conditions.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances, the chief of police of Fribourg, through the
                            Gruyere prefecture, notified Stolz for the last time, on March 8 ultimo,
                            that he must straighten his situation as soon as possible or be expelled
                            from the Canton.</p>
                        <p>Now the chief of police of Fribourg puts the question, Can the legation
                            of the United States of America thus cancel a passport regularly issued
                            to one of its citizens? If such proceedings were permissible, the chief
                            of police of Fribourg would feel himself constrained in the future to
                            deny any American citizen who might come to settle in the Canton the
                            right to sojourn therein.</p>
                        <p>By way of information the chief of police of Fribourg adds that Emile
                            Stolz must have originally been of German extraction. He declares he was
                            born in Alsace; never having performed military service in Germany, he
                            never had identification papers from that country. He has lived at
                            Basel, and, for several years, in America. A brother of his, married and
                            father of a family, lives at La Tour de Trême, where he owns a bakery.
                            The latter holds a regular certificate of origin, issued by the
                            prefecture of Lorrach, in Baden, on September 23, 1899, and good for
                            five years.</p>
                        <p>I am instructed by my Government and now have the honor to transmit
                            herewith the canceled passport of Stolz and to inquire of your
                            excellency whether the legation of the United States at Berne may not be
                            authorized to issue a new passport to the applicant?</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of the 24th ultimo in regard to one Emile
                            Stolz.</p>
                        <p>Without going into a recital of the facts in his case as set forth in
                            your note, I desire to state that the refusal of the legation of the
                            United States at Berne to issue a new passport to Stolz was entirely
                            justified by the facts and by the general instructions of this
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>Stolz, who obtained naturalization in the United States, has been absent
                            from this country for fourteen years. He settled in Switzerland,
                            married, and reared a family there. It appears also that he has taken
                            every step in his power to acquire Swiss nationality, but is unable to
                            find any commune which will accept him as a burgher because of his
                            scanty means and large family.</p>
                        <p>The position of this Government in cases like this where an American
                            citizen goes to a foreign country and settles there animo manendi, is
                            that he thereby forfeits the right to the protection of this Government
                            and is to be considered as having expatriated himself.</p>
                        <p>The Department is unable to comply with the request of your Government
                            that the legation of the United States at Berne be authorized to issue a
                            new passport to Stolz.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Assistant Secretary of State</hi>: My Government
                            instructs me to call upon your extreme good offices with a view to
                            determining the nationality of one Louis Rover.</p>
                        <p>The latter was registered as born in Lyons on the 18th of October, 1888,
                            of Léon Jean Rover, born in New York, and of his “spouse,” Germaine
                            Rivière, a French woman, born at Lyons.</p>
                        <p>But Léon Jean Rover and Germaine (or rather Genevieve) Rivière were, as a
                            matter of fact, not husband and wife at that time; their marriage was
                            not solemnized until the 21st of May, 1891, in the presence of the
                            registrar of London city. The couple have since then separated by mutual
                            agreement without a decree of divorce, the father having by a regular
                            deed left the child in the custody of the mother.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances I take the liberty of asking whether the State
                            law of New York admits that Louis Rover, born out of wedlock of an
                            American and a French woman, was legitimatized by the subsequent
                            marriage of his parents and has thus acquired United States
                            citizenship.</p>
                        <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0592"/>
                        <p>As there does not appear to be any evidence that Léon Jean Rover is an
                            American citizen, I should also be very grateful if you could cause an
                            inquiry to be made upon that point, should there be some chance of
                            success.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Replying to your note of the 30tb ultimo,
                            I have now the honor to inform you that the attorney-general of the
                            State of New York, under date of the 16th instant, declares it to be his
                            opinion that by section 18 of the domestic regulations law of the State
                            of New York, chapter 272 of the laws of 1896, as amended by chapter 725
                            of the laws of 1899, “an illegitimate child, whose parents have
                            heretofore intermarried or shall hereafter intermarry, shall thereby
                            become legitimatized and shall become legitimate for all purposes,
                            entitled to all the rights and privileges of a legitimate child; but an
                            estate or an interest vested or trust created before the marriage of a
                            parent of such child shall not be divested or affected by reason of such
                            child being legitimatized.”</p>
                        <p>Section 1933 of the Revised Statutes of the United States provides that
                            “all children heretofore or hereafter born out of the limits and
                            jurisdiction of the United States whose fathers were or may be at the
                            time of their birth citizens thereof are declared to be citizens of the
                            United States; but the rights of citizenship shall not descend to
                            children whose fathers have never resided in the United States,” and
                            section 1992 declares all persons born in the United States and not
                            subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, to be
                            citizens of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Assuming that the father of Louis Rover, Leon Jean Rover, who was born in
                            New York, had never renounced his American citizenship acquired by his
                            birth, it is the opinion of the Department that Louis Rover, born in
                            France in 1888 of a French mother, became a citizen of the United States
                            by the subsequent marriage of his parents in 1891, in pursuance of
                            section 18 of the domestic relations law of New York, cited at the
                            beginning of this note.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to confirm my telegram of
                            yesterday wherein I request that the battle ship <hi rend="italic"
                                >Kentucky</hi> be allowed to remain a little longer in Turkish
                            waters in order to remove any impression that its visit here is of a
                            hostile nature.</p>
                        <p>I have to acknowledge the receipt this day of your reply.</p>
                        <p>I have now to report that on the 10th instant I attended a dinner at
                            Yildiz Palace, accompanied by Captain Chester and his staff. I presented
                            these gentlemen to His Majesty in audience before dinner, and after
                            dinner Captain Chester and I were received in a long private
                            audience.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan welcomed Captain Chester cordially, and expressed to him the
                            pleasure he had in entertaining him in Constantinople. During the
                            conversation there was no mention of the diplomatic affairs pending
                            between the two countries beyond the fact that the Sultan stated he had
                            purchased a cruiser from Messrs. Cramp, of Philadelphia. It was apparent
                            that he regarded our questions as absolutely settled, and his evident
                            desire was to convey this impression without using any direct
                            expressions. He evinced a most friendly disposition <pb n="515"
                                xml:id="pg_515" facs="0595"/>toward the United States and requested
                            that the President be fully informed as to the reception of Captain
                            Chester and the entertainment at the palace. The dinner was a very
                            direct compliment to the United States, as no other foreigners were
                            invited, and necessarily I was placed at His Majesty’s left hand, and at
                            his right was the grand vizier and then Captain Chester. Nearly all the
                            cabinet officials and marshals of the Empire were present. During the
                            dinner His Majesty conversed affably with me and showed a friendly
                            interest in the American Navy and American institutions. He informed me
                            that if the cruiser which he had just bought from Messrs. Cramp was a
                            success he intended to buy in America three or four more of a larger
                            type. He also stated that he had great confidence in the rifles
                            manufactured in America, and that he proposed in the near future to make
                            a large purchase for his army.</p>
                        <p>Captain Chester leaves to-day for Smyrna, and his orders from the Navy
                            Department were to leave for Manila as soon as he returned to his ship.
                            He was desirous of remaining long enough to exchange courtesies with the
                            local Turkish authorities, and it seemed to me desirable that the ship’s
                            departure should not be too abrupt, so I therefore telegraphed you as
                            above reported, expressing the hope that the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Kentucky</hi> be allowed to remain a little longer in Turkish
                            waters.</p>

                        <p>The information given below is believed to be correct, yet it is not to
                            be considered as official, as it relates to the laws and regulations of
                            a foreign country.</p>

                        <p>The Turkish Government denies the right of a Turk to become a citizen of
                            any other country without the authority of the Turkish Government. His
                            naturalization is therefore regarded by Turkey as void with reference to
                            himself and his children, and he is forbidden to return to Turkey.</p>
                        <p>The consent of the Turkish Government to the naturalization in another
                            country of a former Turk is given only upon condition that the applicant
                            shall stipulate either never to return, or, returning, to regard himself
                            as a Turkish subject. Therefore, if a naturalized American citizen of
                            Turkish origin returns to Turkey he may expect arrest and imprisonment
                            or expulsion.</p>
                        <p>Jews are prohibited from colonizing in Turkish dominions.</p>
                        <p>There is no treaty between the United States and Turkey defining the
                            status of naturalized Americans of Turkish birth returning to
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <p>Passports are required from all persons entering Turkish dominions (Egypt
                            excepted), and persons who enter without passports are liable to fine or
                            imprisonment. The passports should, if possible, be viséed by a Turkish
                            consular officer in the United States.</p>

                            inclosed a copy of a dispatch from Consul Merrill at Jerusalem, wherein
                            he reports that he has been notified of a new order issued by the
                            Ottoman minister of the interior in relation to foreign Jews who visit
                            Palestine. The order applies to all Jews who come to Palestine from
                            other countries as pilgrims or visitors, and it provides as follows:</p>
                        <p>On arriving at Jaffa the visitor must deliver his passport to the Turkish
                            authorities and receive in return a Turkish document. The visitor is
                            allowed to reside in the country three months, at the expiration of
                            which time he must surrender his Turkish permit, receive his passport,
                            and leave. In case they do not leave when requested at the expiration of
                            the time allowed, the consuls of different nationalities are to be
                            called upon to compel their subjects to depart.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Merrill points out that the only hold the consulate has on
                            naturalized American Jews in Palestine is the possession of their
                            passport and citizenship papers. Also, they do not always depart at
                            Jaffa, the usual point of arrival. If they do not leave at the
                            expiration of three months, the consul must have authority to send them
                            away in case they refuse to go. The refusal is generally given on the
                            grounds of having no money.</p>
                        <p>As I am transmitting this dispatch at once for the information and
                            instructions of the Department, I have not yet ascertained what action,
                            if any, the other foreign missions propose to take in the matter.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: We have received from the governor of
                                Jerusalem a copy of an order from the Turkish minister of the
                                interior at Constantinople relative to Jews who visit Palestine.
                                Said order, we are notified, goes into effect on the 15th of January
                                Greek style, or January 29 of our reckoning.</p>
                            <p>The order applies to all Jews who come to Palestine from other
                                countries as pilgrims or visitors.</p>
                            <p>The conditions are as follows:</p>
                            <p>On arriving at Jaffa the visitor must deliver his passport to the
                                Turkish authorities and receive therefor a Turkish document. The
                                visitor is allowed to reside in the country three months. At the
                                expiration of that time he must leave the country, surrender his
                                Turkish permit, and receive therefor his passport.</p>
                            <p>In case that foreign subjects do not leave when requested at the
                                expiration of their permits, the consuls of the different
                                nationalities are to be called upon to compel their subjects to go
                                away.</p>
                            <p>When an American naturalized Jew arrives in Palestine the only hold
                                we have upon him is his passport and citizen papers, if he has any.
                                If his passport is deposited with the Turkish authorities at Jaffa,
                                where he lands, what shall we do?</p>
                            <p>Again, visitors frequently make their way north up through the
                                country and embark at Beirut. But if their passports have been
                                deposited with the Turkish authorities at Jaffa, and held by them,
                                what can be done?</p>
                            <p>If such visitors are obliged to leave at the expiration of the three
                                months, the consul must be authorized to send them away in case they
                                refuse to go. They will almost certainly plead that they can not go
                                because they “have no money.”</p>
                            <p>This order concerns this consulate more than any other United States
                                consulate in Turkey, for it is well known that to one naturalized
                                Jew landing at any other port, 25 or 30 land at Jaffa, the port of
                                Jerusalem.</p>
                            <p>It will be seen at once that in this matter definite instructions are
                                needed. Otherwise the same old chronic trouble will reappear; the
                                consul says one thing and the local Turkish authorities say another
                                thing; there will be constant irritation and annoyance.</p>
                            <p>I should have communicated these facts earlier to the legation, but
                                it is only within a few days that we received the order in
                                question.</p>
                            <p>I remain, etc.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            dispatch No. 316, of the 31st ultimo, reporting that you are advised by
                            the United States consul at Jerusalem that the Ottoman minister of the
                            interior has issued a new order respecting the sojourn in Palestine of
                            foreign Jews who go there as pilgrims or visitors.</p>
                        <p>You state the provisions of the order and request instructions in the
                            premises.</p>
                        <p>Setting aside the objectionable feature whereby a racial or religious
                            distinction is made in regard to Jews, and of which feature this
                            Government finds difficulty in taking official cognizance, in view of
                            our constitutional inhibition against any disability founded on creed,
                            the Turkish order now reported appears to establish the rule of three
                            months’ permitted sojourn of American visitors to Palestine, for which
                            we have always contended. See instructions to Mr. Straus, No. 13, dated
                            October 14, 1898, and subsequent correspondence, on the subject <pb
                                n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0598"/>of the Ottoman regulations
                            respecting the entrance of foreign Jews into Palestine.</p>
                        <p>It should, however, be made clear to the Turkish authorities that the
                            consuls of the United States in Turkish jurisdiction are neither
                            directed nor permitted by law to assist the Turkish officers in their
                            execution of municipal laws or regulations, and therefore could not
                            intervene to constrain the departure of an American citizen from Turkish
                            jurisdiction. Neither can the consul be called upon to forego the
                            performance of his duty in case an American citizen should be harshly
                            dealt with in contravention of treaty or law.</p>
                        <p>As the consul is without authority to compel a visiting American citizen
                            to deposit his passport and citizen papers in the consulate, it would
                            seem that he is not in a position to contest the Turkish requirement

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to inclose herewith duplicate of
                            application of one Demetrius Chryssanthides for passport which I felt
                            compelled to refuse, and submit the facts for your information. The
                            applicant, as will be observed, is a native of Greece, having obtained
                            his certificate of naturalization from the superior court of San
                            Francisco on the 2d day of April, 1896. His answers not being very
                            clear, I questioned him further and discovered from his own statements
                            that he had not fully complied with his conditions specified on oath,
                            having been absent from the United States during the five years
                            immediately prior to obtaining his naturalization papers, as he
                            acknowledged that he left the United States in October, 1892, remaining
                            in Europe until the month of February, 1893.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances I felt compelled to decline to issue a passport
                            to him and made memorandum on his certificate of naturalization, but as
                            it would be a very easy matter for him to obtain a duplicate, if you
                            deem it wise, it might be advisable to have a letter written to the
                            clerk of the superior court at San Francisco, calling the above facts to
                            the attention of the court.</p>
                        <p>Trusting above will meet with your approval, I have, ete.,</p>

                                Francisco; that I was naturalized as a citizen of the United States
                                before the superior court of city and county of San Francisco, on
                                the 2d day of April, 1896, as shown by the accompanying certificate
                                of naturalization; that I am the bearer of passport No. 1, issued by
                                W. W. Rockhill, Athens, on the 30th day of September, 1897, which is

                                States, my permanent residence therein being at Boston, in the State
                                of Massachusetts, where I follow the occupation of barber; that I
                                last left the United States on the—day of August, 1899, on board the
                                White Star Line, arriving in Liverpool the 20th day of August, 1899;
                                that I have resided in Alexandria since the 20th day of September,
                                1899; that I am now temporarily residing at Constantinople, and that

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the recipt of your
                            dispatch No. 25, of the 17th ultimo, reporting that you have refused to
                            issue a passport to Demetrius Chryssanthides, because he had not resided
                            continuously in the United States during the five years preceding the
                            date on which his certificate of naturalization was granted by the
                            superior court of the city and county of San Francisco.</p>
                        <p>In the treaty between the United States and Bavaria concerning
                            naturalization, signed May 26, 1868, Article I provides that Bavarians
                            who shall become naturalized in the United States, and “shall have
                            resided uninterruptedly “in the United States for five years shall be
                            treated as American citizens. An explanatory protocol to the treaty
                            says, in paragraph 2 of Article I:</p>
                        <p>“The words ‘resided uninterruptedly’ are obviously to be understood, not
                            of a continual bodily presence, but in the legal sense; and, therefore,
                            a transient absence, a journey, or the like, by no means interrupts the
                            period of five years contemplated by the first article.” The same
                            explanation appears in the protocol to the naturalization treaty with
                            Wurttemberg of July 27, 1868. The Department has never doubted that that
                            explanation would be accepted by the other powers with which the United
                            States has naturalization treaties. (See The American Passport, page
                            175.)</p>
                        <p>This is the accepted construction of the words “resided uninterruptedly,”
                            but the law is (sec. 2170, R. S.): “No alien shall be admitted to to
                            become a citizen who has not for the continued term of five years next
                            preceding his admission resided within the United States.” This is
                            broader than the language of the treaties, and is to be understood in
                            the ordinary legal sense, according to which “a transient absence for
                            business, pleasure, or other occasion, with the intention of returning”
                            (13 Opinions of the Attorneys-General, 376) does not interrupt the
                            residence.</p>
                        <p>“The just rule, it is apprehended, is that suggested by Senator Berrien
                            [in the debate on the law]: ‘If the applicant is absent any part of the
                            time [during the five years before naturalization] it remains for the
                            court to decide whether that absence is sufficient to prevent the
                            issuing of the certificate.’” (American Law Review, February, 1895;
                            article by Frederick Van Dyne, Assistant Solicitor, Department of
                            State.)</p>
                        <p>In the case under consideration, Chryssanthides was absent about five
                            months, three years before his naturalization. Whether or not this was a
                            period long enough to have destroyed his residence was a question for
                            the court before which he applied for naturalization to determine. The
                            presumption is that the court decided properly.</p>
                        <p>Upon the showing presented by you the Department is of the opinion that
                            this absence did not by itself furnish sufficient reason for refusing to
                            issue a passport to Chryssanthides. Unless there is more evidence
                            adverse to his good faith than you submit, he should be granted a
                            passport and the adverse memorandum made on his naturalization
                            certificate should, as far as possible, be removed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to inclose herewith petition from
                            Rev. J. L. Fowle and other American missionaries located at Cesarea,
                            requesting the Department of State to authorize the British consul at
                            Angora to look after American interests, as we have no consular
                            representative at that point.</p>
                        <p>Pending your decision, I have not deemed it prudent to bring the matter
                            to the attention of the British ambassador, but have no doubt that the
                            British Government would gladly consent to have their consul take charge
                            of American interests at Angora, or, in fact, at all other points in the
                            Ottoman Empire where they have a consular representative and the
                            american Government has not, as Sir Nicholas O’Conor, the British
                            Ambassador here, has frequently spoken to me of the advisability of
                            having English and American consuls look after the joint interest of
                            English and American citizens throughout the Turkish Empire, as the
                            country generally is in a rather unsettled and disturbed condition, and
                            if one can credit one-half of the numerous reports and rumors, the word
                            dangerous may be added; and Sir Nicholas O’Conor has even gone so far as
                            to suggest that if such an arrangement could be made, he would seriously
                            consider changing some of his consuls from points where we both have
                            representatives to points where neither Government is represented at
                            present, particularly mentioning the desirability of transferring the
                            English consul now at Sivas, where we have Mr. Jewett, and placing him
                            at Bitlis, a disturbed district, where neither the English nor American
                            Government is represented.</p>
                        <p>If such an arrangement is practical it would receive my hearty
                            indorsement, as no one can tell what a day may bring forth here, and as
                            long as present conditions exist every proper precaution should be taken
                            to properly insure the lives and properties of American citizens, as the
                            uncertainty which exists warrants measures that might at present appear
                            unnecessary or even absurd. The rumors of disturbances, uprisings, etc.,
                            are of too vague a character to describe, and while there is nothing in
                            the immediate situation to justify any grave uneasiness there is
                            sufficient to warrant the exercise of more than ordinary care and
                            precaution.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: You may, perhaps, recall our
                                conversation of May 23, regarding a request to the Department of
                                State that the British consul at Angora, H. S. Shipley, esq., be
                                authorized officially to take charge of any business pertaining to
                                the Americans here at Oesarea that would naturally come under the
                                jurisdiction of an American consul if we had one in this (Angora)
                                vilayet.</p>

                                the local authorities have lately, under the pretext that they have
                                no order from the minister of foreign affairs to recognize us as
                                being in charge of American interests, commenced not only to contest

                            No. 60 of the 22d ultimo, with inclosed copy of a letter of the 17th
                            ultimo from the British consul at Broussa, stating that the local
                            authorities in places where American citizens are unrepresented contest
                            the right of British agents to take charge of their interests and insist
                            on Americans applying to them directly for any needed assistance.</p>
                        <p>With reference to your repeated suggestion as to the advisability of
                            concerted action between British and American consulates throughout the
                            Ottoman Empire, I have to say that the usual rule of this Department in
                            authorizing one of its diplomatic or consular representatives abroad to
                            take charge of the interests of unrepresented citizens or subjects of
                            another nation, is to make acceptance of the friendly trust conditional
                            on the acquiescence of the government or authority to which our agent is
                            accredited. If the consent of the government of the country be necessary
                            to enable one of our consuls to use his good offices in behalf of the
                            citizens or subjects of another nation, it is expected that such consent
                            will be sought, just as it is when our consul takes temporary charge of
                            the affairs of a consulate of another country which may for any cause
                            become vacant for the time being.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as the consul temporarily acting does not become the official
                            representative of another government, recognition of his competency to
                            exert his friendly offices does not involve application for or issuance
                            of an exequatur, but merely the usual courteous acquiescence of the
                            government of the country, followed by appropriate notification to its
                            local officers.</p>
                        <p>You will communicate these views to your British colleague and confer
                            with him further upon the subject.</p>

                            correspondence in regard to Rev. R. M. Cole, at present located at
                            Bitlis, who according to his <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0604"
                            />own statements has been restrained from moving about freely for nearly
                            a year past on account of the local governor refusing for some unknown
                            reasons to grant him a teskéréh or traveling passport. This regulation
                            has been in force for many years, and as long as it is not abused is no
                            doubt a very sensible and proper police regulation, as few if any of the
                            Turkish agents can read either English or French; but as I knew of no
                            reason why Mr. Cole should be restrained in any way, and as I considered
                            that the guaranteed rights and privileges of American citizens generally
                            were being infringed upon, I decided to take a very decided and firm
                            stand, and if this does not result in correcting the matter it is my
                            intention to instruct Mr. Cole to travel freely upon his American
                            passport, and if necessary send a kavass to accompany him, notifying the
                            Porte at the same time that I will hold the Ottoman Government strictly
                            accountable not only for Mr. Cole’s safety, but also for any delay,
                            damage, or indignity which he may suffer.</p>

                            <p>The Rev. R. M. Cole, of the American mission at Bitlis, having
                                occasion to go to Moush applied to the governor-general for an
                                escort which was at once given, and on September 12 Mr. Cole left
                                Bitlis. On the outskirts of Moush he was met by two police
                                commissioners who demanded his teskéréh or, in lieu of which, a
                                bourouldi. Unfortunately, Mr. Cole had omitted the formality of
                                requesting either the one or the other and, in consequence, was not
                                permitted to enter the city. He protested that the fact of his
                                having an escort was sufficient evidence that he was traveling with
                                the full consent of the governor-general at Bitlis. It was of no
                                avail, and he was ordered back to Bitlis. The governor-general upon
                                receiving Mr. Cole’s complaint stated that the police of Moush had
                                been officious. He refused, however, to issue the necessary papers
                                and left the city the following day, and his assistant has since
                                declined to permit the reverend gentleman to enjoy his undoubted
                                treaty right of travel.</p>
                            <p>Having no recognition outside of his province, I addressed a note to
                                the governor-general in which I briefly stated Mr. Cole’s case, and,
                                without discussing either the action of the governor-general or that
                                of the police commissioners of Moush, I requested him, on my behalf,
                                to be good enough to telegraph to his colleague at Bitlis to grant
                                Mr. Cole the privilege secured by treaty to make his journey to
                                Moush. His excellency at once consenting to telegraph, I sent the
                                following telegram to Mr. Cole: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            <p>In reply Mr. Cole wired me: “Just asked again. Order impossible this

                            <p>I then sent you the telegram confirmed above. Have heard nothing
                                further from Mr. Cole.</p>
                            <p>Had Mr. Cole taken the precaution to provide himself with a bourouldi
                                when first leaving Bitlis his detention and return to Bitlis by the

                                />Moush would probably not have happened, and I have written him
                                suggesting that in future whenever he has occasion to travel he
                                request the usual teskéréh, or bourouldi, so that the minor
                                authorities may have no possible grounds for interfering with him.
                                The action of the police commissioners’ was irregular, as it was
                                their duty to conduct Mr. Cole, under the circumstances, to the
                                governor of Moush and not compel his return to Bitlis.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: The Rev. Royal M. Cole, of Bitlis
                                (Kourdistan) sends me word that the vali at that place is refusing
                                to issue to him the usual papers for traveling in his district.</p>
                            <p>This prohibition has lasted for some months, during which time Mr.
                                Cole has been, in reality, a prisoner in the city of Bitlis.</p>
                            <p>His work has often required his presence in the outlying towns of the
                                district, but repeated requests for the local passport (teskéréh
                                usually given for traveling) have been met with a firm refusal.</p>
                            <p>The vali claims to be acting under the most positive orders from
                                Constantinople that forbid his using any discretion in the matter
                                whatever. He usually professes that but for these orders he would
                                readily grant the passports as heretofore.</p>
                            <p>The vali has never given any satisfactory reason for the attitude on
                                the part of his superiors, but has in apparent friendship urged Mr.
                                Cole to seek by appeal to his legation at Constantinople a
                                withdrawal of the orders under which he is now compelled to refuse
                                what otherwise he would grant him.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Cole is a missionary, and as such has under his care and
                                direction a number of congregations and schools in the district in
                                which Bitlis is situated. In the usual discharge of his duties he is
                                obliged to visit these congregations and schools from time to time.
                                The prohibition upon his movements has deprived him from discharging
                                his duties in this regard for now more than six months.</p>
                            <p>This attitude on the part of the Government is utterly different from
                                the usage of the past seventy years, and is so plainly a violation
                                of the rights we have hitherto enjoyed and those that others do now
                                enjoy as to call, it seems to me, for a demand that the embargo on
                                Mr. Cole’s activities be withdrawn or that the Government justify
                                themselves in the position they are now holding toward Mr. Cole.</p>
                            <p>Very respectfully,</p>

                                my note No. 17 of June 12, in which I brought to your excellency’s
                                notice the case of the Rev. R. M. Cole, a native American citizen,
                                residing as missionary in charge of schools in the vilayet of
                                Bitlis, owing to the local governor, who claims to be acting under
                                general instructions from Constantinople, refusing to grant him the
                                usual teskéré.</p>

                                bad precedent or interfere with the rights guaranteed them, I can
                                not permit the Rev. Mr. Cole or any of our citizens to be
                                practically treated as prisoners and prevented from traveling freely
                                while in pursuit of their peaceful avocation, and consequently I
                                feel constrained to advise your excellency that unless I am in
                                receipt of written advices on or before the 30th day of June next
                                advising me that proper instructions have been sent to the local
                                governor of Bitlis, and that the customary traveling passport or
                                teskéré has been issued to the Rev. R. M. Cole, I shall be compelled
                                to instruct Mr. Cole to travel wherever his duties may take him on
                                his American passport, and in this event I shall not only hold the
                                Imperial Ottoman Government responsible for his safety and good

                            inclosing a copy of correspondence in regard to the case of the Rev. R.
                            M. Cole, who is at present located at Bitlis, and who had been
                            restrained from moving about freely for nearly a year past because the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose copy of note
                            which I have addressed to the Porte in regard to Rev. R. M. Cole, from
                            which you will observe that, notwithstanding the promises made by the
                            Imperial Ottoman Government and the instructions sent to local vali,
                            which were afterwards countermanded, the desired Turkish traveling
                            teskéréh was not furnished to Mr. Cole, and consequently I felt
                            compelled to assume the position indicated in above-mentioned note.</p>
                        <p>From what I can glean, the antagonism shown is caused by a desire to
                            annoy and harass Mr. Cole for the active interest he has always taken in
                            the Armenian cause, especially during the massacres.</p>
                        <p>If Mr. Cole carries out instructions strictly I do not anticipate any
                            serious trouble.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: Referring to the legation note
                                No. 22 of June 24 last, I beg to advise your excellency that I
                                refrained from taking any action in regard to the Rev. Mr. Cole,
                                having been assured by his excellency the minister of the interior
                                on the 30th June that instructions had been sent to the governor of
                                Bitlis to furnish Mr. Cole with a traveling teskéréh, and, if
                                necessary, to furnish him with a guard. This information was
                                confirmed by Mr. Cole, who, it appears, accepted the word of the
                                acting governor that he would be given a teskéréh whenever he wished
                                to travel, the excuse being that countermanding orders had been
                                received from Constantinople. This appeared very much like an act of
                                bad faith on the part of some of His Imperial Majesty’s officials
                                which can not be overlooked, and as the Government of the United
                                States can not permit any infringement on the rights guaranteed
                                through the favored nation clause of rights and privileges granted
                                other friendly powers, and not being willing to permit Mr. Cole
                                being treated practically as a prisoner, I have to-day telegraphed
                                Mr. Cole authorizing him to travel freely wherever his duty and
                                personal interests may call him throughout the Turkish Empire, and I
                                hereby notify your excellency that I shall hold the Imperial Ottoman
                                Government responsible for the personal safety of Mr. Cole and
                                strictly accountable of any damage, annoyances, or inconveniences
                                which may suffer.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I received your telegram while ill in
                                bed, advising that the local governor had refused you a traveling
                                teskéréh. This was quite a surprise to me, as I was led to believe
                                by your telegram that you had already been furnished with same. As I
                                had taken extra precautions to assure myself, as not being satisfied
                                with the assurance given me by the minister of the interior that
                                word has been sent to the governor of Bitlis to furnish you with a
                                traveling teskéréh and if necessary with a guard, I wired you to the
                                effect and asked you whether it has been done, to which you replied:
                                “Received your telegram. Vali’s representative says instructions
                                arrived that no hindrance to my traveling. See letter,” giving me to
                                understand that you had been furnished with the desired passport,
                                but it now appears that you merely accepted the acting governor’s
                                promise that you would be furnished with desired passport when you
                                were to travel and when that time arrived you were refused and given
                                to understand that countermanding order had been received from
                                Constantinople.</p>
                            <p>Under the circumstances I have wired advising you to travel wherever
                                your duty or personal interests called you on your American
                                passport, but not attempt to go anywhere that is dangerous or
                                unsafe, and be very careful not to take any unusual risks; and you
                                should also take the precaution to notify the local governor before
                                starting that you intend visiting such and such a place, so as to
                                leave no room for any excuse should you be stopped, interfered with,
                                or attacked by the police, by the authorities, or by burglars en

                            8th of this month a French squadron arrived at Mytilene, and after
                            landing a body of marines the French admiral took possession of the
                            custom-house, over which he flew the French flag. As soon as information
                            of this was received here the Turkish Government gave orders that
                            telegraphic communication with Mytilene should be cut off, and through
                            this action the chargé d’affaires of France at Constantinople was unable
                            to communicate with the French admiral at Mytilene.</p>

                            which had originally caused the difficulty between Turkey and

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have three sons; the oldest, George
                                A., was born at Baltimore, Md., and is now United States
                                vice-commercial agent here. The other two, Louis F. E., aged 17
                                years, and Richard D., aged 15 years, were born here.</p>
                            <p>When I was in Washington in the month of June, 1899, I called on the
                                chief of the naturalization bureau, stating to him that I have been
                                United States consular and commercial agent here since 1873, and
                                asking him if my two younger sons, born here, would have the
                                privilege of American citizenship. He answered that any sons of
                                United States consular officers who were citizens of the United
                                States are considered Americans, and if my two sons were in the
                                United States he would give them a certificate of American
                                citizenship, but as they were at the time at college in Nuremburg,
                                Germany, he advised me to apply to the United States consul in
                                Nuremburg (to whom he wrote a few lines), who would take the boys’
                                deposition and request the United States minister at Berlin to grant
                                a certificate of citizenship. Following these directions, the boys
                                received in August, 1899, their certificate of citizenship from the
                                United States embassy at Berlin. Since then Louis attended college
                                in Gera, Germany, where it seems this certificate was mislaid, and
                                he arrived here a few weeks ago without it.</p>
                            <p>Now, would you kindly inform me if you could grant him a certificate
                                of citizenship; and if not, what steps I would have to take in order

                            No. 442, of the 21st ultimo, inclosing copy of a dispatch from Mr. John
                            G. Hufnagel, United States commercial agent at Paysandu, making
                            application for a passport for his minor son, Louis F. E. Hufnagel.</p>
                        <p>The status of young Hufnagel would appear to be covered by section 2172
                            of the Revised Statutes, which declares that the son of a naturalized
                            citizen of the United States “though born out of the limits and
                            jurisdiction of the United States “may be considered a citizen thereof.
                            Mr. Hufnagel, sr., was, as the Department understands, naturalized as a
                            citizen of the United States in 1851, and had not lost his citizenship
                            when his son was born. When the son reaches the age of 21 years he will
                            be expected to elect his nationality. Until then he is entitled to the
                            protection of the United States.</p>
                        <p>You are instructed, therefore, upon proof of the facts as alleged, to
                            issue a passport to young Mr. Hufnagel.</p>

                            <p>Mr. William Finch, the envoy extraordinary and minister
                                plenipotentiary of the United States of North America, paid a visit
                                yesterday to Mr. Eduardo MacEachen, the minister of government.</p>
                            <p>After a few moments Mr. MacEachen accompanied the esteemed diplomat
                                to the office of the minister of foreign affairs, where they
                                remained more than half an hour in pleasant conversation.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Finch is a good friend of our country and loses no opportunity of
                                demonstrating it. The proof of it is in the words expressed by him,
                                when he presented Rear-Admiral Cromwell to His Excellency the
                                President of the Republic, three or four days ago.</p>
                            <p>When the Chief Magistrate offered a glass of champagne to the
                                distinguished visitors after saluting the rear-admiral, Mr. Finch in
                                his turn toasted to the prosperity of the Republic, saying that
                                during the three years he has held his high office he had always
                                found in the President an excellent friend of the United States.</p>
                            <p>The President answered saying that the North American minister, Mr.
                                Finch, had won all the sympathies of the citizens and Government of
                                the Republic by the correctness of his proceedings and the worthy
                                manner with which he represents his country.</p>

                            company here, was never delivered. Mr. Balz has been imprisoned before

                            <p>On the night of October 22 I received a cable from our consular agent
                                at Barcelona stating that he was in prison “incomunicado” by order
                                from Caracas, and knew nothing of the cause of his arrest. I went
                                the next morning to the foreign office and was informed that the
                                consul had been arrested by mistake, but had been released with due
                                apologies. The consul telegraphed me that he had been released
                                without any explanation. On the 24th I sent a telegram as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p>“Government has informed me that you were arrested by mistake, but on
                                discovering the error you had been released with due apologies.
                                Answer.”</p>
                            <p>This telegram was sent on the 24th of October, but was never received
                                in Barcelona.</p>

                            Barcelona. The meaning of the inclosed answer is that the case, so far
                            as this Government is concerned, has been dropped. There will be no
                            further investigation, in all probability, for this is the usual formula

                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: A few weeks ago I had the
                                honor, during the course of a conversation at the foreign office, to
                                invite your attention to the consideration of an incident which
                                occurred last October. I refer to the arrest of the consular agent
                                of the United States at Barcelona. I am now directed by my
                                Government to bring the matter to the attention of your excellency
                                and to ask for its prompt and earnest consideration.</p>
                            <p>The facts in the case appear to be as follows:</p>
                            <p>On the afternoon of October 22, 1900, Mr. I. H. Balz, the consular
                                agent of the United States at Barcelona, was arrested without due
                                process of law and cast into prison. It was stated that the minister
                                of the interior telegraphed the authorities at Barcelona that the
                                Balz wanted was one who was treasurer under the Government, in that
                                State, of President Rolando. The authorities knew very well that Mr.
                                Balz was a peaceful merchant, who never had any connection with the
                                Government at Barcelona. Notwithstanding that, and despite his
                                protests, he was arrested, imprisoned, and kept in confinement till
                                9 o’clock the following morning, when he was released with the
                                remark that his arrest and incarceration “was a mistake.”</p>
                            <p>Mr. Russell, upon learning of Mr. Balz’s arrest, at once called upon
                                your excellency and recited the facts respecting it. Mr. Russell was
                                informed that the arrest was a mistake and that Mr. Balz had been
                                released with due explanations and apologies.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Russell then sent the following telegram to Mr. Balz, which has
                                not yet reached him. It was sent over the Government lines and was
                                paid for at the time of filing in the Caracas office:</p>

                                inmediatamente le había puesto en libertad con las debidas excusas.

                            <p>No satisfactory apology has been made in connection with this arrest,
                                and it is not the first time Mr. Balz has been subjected to harsh
                                treatment at the hands of the local authorities at Barcelona.</p>
                            <p>Referring to the incident in question, I am instructed by my
                                Government to say that it will protect Mr. Balz while acting as its
                                consular representative against the arbitrary interference of local
                                officials, and I am further instructed to request that suitable
                                apologies be made to Mr. Balz and that sufficient measures be taken

                                and that the failure to deliver Mr. Russell’s telegram has not been
                                at all explained.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: Referring to the affair of
                                Mr. Balz, mentioned in your excellency’s note of the 30th of last
                                month, this ministry has asked from the ministry of interior a full
                                report of the occurrence, and the ministry of fomento has also been
                                asked to explain the apparent loss of the telegram sent by Mr.
                                Russell. As to the excuses or explanations referred to in your note,
                                this ministry is of the opinion that Mr. Balz ought to be satisfied,
                                as the local authorities were immediately called upon to explain the
                                motive for the arrest and their report was transmitted through
                                official channels. The miscarriage of the telegram would, at best,
                                be an unpleasant incident that would have nothing to do with the
                                Government’s desire to throw light on the case and explain it
                                satisfactorily.</p>
                            <p>The Government took action in this case because it deems that a
                                consular agent is always worthy of much consideration, but as all
                                action must necessarily be limited, considering the character of the
                                official in question, it is not possible to take such action as
                                would be taken had the incident occurred to a diplomatic
                                representative. It is useless to attempt to explain to your
                                excellency the radical differences between the two cases—differences
                                which make the consular agent subject to civil jurisdiction as far
                                as his property and person are concerned.<note n="a"
                                    xml:id="d491fna">This is a generally admitted doctrine, and
                                    accepted by the United States and Venezuela without any
                                    modification whatever.</note> Inviolability is confined to the
                                office, the flag, the archives, escutcheon, and seals; consequently
                                complaints from consuls can never be regarded as seriously as
                                complaints from public ministers.</p>
                            <p>I make these observations to your excellency in order to inform you
                                of the measures that have been taken to clear up the affair of Mr.
                                Balz, who can look for no other action to be taken in his case than
                                would be taken in similar cases with respect to any person whatever
                                entitled to the guaranty and protection given by the laws of the
                                country.</p>

                                “Scorpion.</hi>”</head>
                            <p>That on the the 22d of October, 1900, about 12 o’clock m., the
                                magistrate of the town came into my store, informing me that the
                                president of the state wished to see me.</p>
                            <p>I asked him if it was possible to wait until after breakfast. He told
                                me that the matter was urgent. I then complied with his request by
                                following him immediately. When I got about six paces from my store,
                                he told me that I was a prisoner by the order of his superior. I
                                told him that it was a mistake, and that he should permit me to
                                speak to the president, which was allowed afterwards. When I arrived
                                at the president’s house, he told me that he had received orders
                                from the President of the Republic for my arrest without
                                communication. I told him, as I stated above, that it was an error,
                                and at once I asked the cause. He answered me that he was ignorant
                                of the circumstance.</p>
                            <p>The president of state wired to the Caracas Government that his
                                orders had been carried out, and at the same time, to bring to light
                                the particulars of said case. I then asked to be allowed to remain
                                at my house until things were being justified, but I was refused. He
                                (the secretary) decided that as the President of the Republic
                                ordered my arrest, I must be a prisoner.</p>
                            <p>I was then taken as a prisoner to the commandant’s house, where I
                                remained in custody without communication for a period of twenty-one
                                hours, after which time I was released from prison without an
                                apology, with only an intimation from the president of the state
                                that it was a mistake.</p>

                            a long talk with the minister of foreign affairs a fews days ago
                            concerning the Balz case. He showed no disposition to take a view
                            different from the one already <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0618"
                            />entertained by his Government, and argued for halt an hour that as
                            Balz was a consular officer he had no right to protection of a special
                            character. I said I did not care to go over the ground again, but that
                            my Government was of opinion that a satisfactory apology or explanation
                            was due, and I remarked that it was my personal notion that if no
                            satisfaction were offered in this case it would look as though a foreign
                            consular officer in Venezuela could in no wise count upon adequate
                            protection from imprisonment and persecution at the hands of local
                            military authorities. The minister said that he was not willing to admit
                            that; and “Then,” said I, “kindly say whether it is, or is not, the
                            intention of your Government to offer a satisfactory explanation or
                            apology in the case of our consular agent at Barcelona.” He said he
                            would let me know in a day or two, and yesterday he sent me word that a
                            satisfactory apology would be offered to Mr. Balz.</p>

                                    <p>“To the <hi rend="smallcaps">Honorable Minister of
                                            Fomento</hi>: On the 13th of the present month, upon the
                                        receipt of your note, steps were taken to investigate the
                                        matter therein referred to, and it is found that the
                                        telegram for Mr. Balz was dispatched without delay from the
                                        office in this city; but as in one of the intermediate
                                        stations there was a considerable interruption on account of
                                        the heavy rains the telegram in question remained in said
                                        station until the lines could be repaired, which it was
                                        intended to do immediately. For this reason the sender was
                                        not notified. The continued heavy rains increased the work
                                        of repairs, and shortly after came the earthquake
                                        catastrophe of October 29. All the offices in the east were
                                        damaged very considerably, and in some even the archives
                                        were lost; so that the telegram in question had to suffer
                                        the fate of all the rest that had accumulated on account of
                                        the interruptions in the service above mentioned; and in
                                        those days of panic and fright it was impossible for the
                                        operators to submit their usual reports, by which the
                                        existence of the telegram in one of the intermediate offices
                                        would have been known, and the sender <pb n="541"
                                            xml:id="pg_541" facs="0621"/>would have been advised of
                                        the delay in transmission. You will see that the cause of
                                        the loss of the telegram was not due to any irregularity in
                                        the telegraph service, but was one of those things that it
                                        was impossible to prevent. The same thing happened to many
                                        other telegrams, many of an official character in regard to
                                        affairs of administration, and also in connection with
                                        department of finance. God and the Federation.</p>

                            <p>From the foregoing report you will see that unforeseen and
                                unavoidable circumstances caused the loss of the telegram referred
                                to, and I sincerely hope that the explanation given will be
                                satisfactory to the legation of the United States. God and the

                            <p>The records of the Department show that naval vessels have visited
                                the Orinoco River on a number of occasions. When no survey has been
                                undertaken these visits have been without previous notice, so far as
                                the Department’s records show. Two recent cases of visits to the
                                Orinoco are the visit of the <hi rend="italic">Kearsarge</hi>,
                                November 7, 1892, and the visit of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Wilmington</hi>, January 23, 1899. The <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Kearsarge</hi> carried on a running survey, without, however,
                                erecting shore stations. There is no record of any protest or
                                objection from the Venezuelan Government on the occasion of either
                                of these visits.</p>
                            <p>The Navy Department understands the status of the Orinoco River, in
                                regard to navigation, to be in all respects similar to that of the
                                Mississippi River. Foreign war vessels pass freely up the
                                Mississippi River without previous notice to this Government. Our
                                war vessels have done the same in the Orinoco River. In the Amazon,
                                for instance, the case is understood to be different. This river,
                                though open to commercial navigation, is not open to war vessels
                                except on special notice and permission.</p>
                            <p>It may be that the minister to Venezuela on his own account, in the
                                case of the visit of the <hi rend="italic">Wilmington</hi>, asked
                                permission or notified the Government of what was contemplated. If
                                so, this is unknown to the Navy Department.</p>
                            <p>On the occasion of the visit of the <hi rend="italic">Wilmington</hi>
                                the Venezuelan Government marked its acquiescence and gratification
                                in that visit by desiring to decorate the commanding officer of the
                                vessel with the order of Bolivar.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: The law of May 15, 1882,
                                numbered 2419 in the national compilation, gives to the head of the
                                Government the power to grant or not, in his judgment, permission to
                                foreign men-of-war to enter, for scientific purposes, ports that are
                                not open. Every time that a war vessel of the United States has made
                                a request of this nature it has been granted without any difficulty,
                                and not long ago United States war vessels were engaged in
                                scientific work in the Cano of San Juan and at the bar at the mouth
                                of the Orinoco, but these vessels had gone through with the legal
                                formality above mentioned, and this formality can not be dispensed
                                with, except in violation of the well-established principles of
                                international law.</p>
                            <p>By direction of the Supreme Chief of the Republic, I call your
                                excellency’s attention to the aforementioned law for the reason that
                                this Government has been disagreeably surprised to learn that a war
                                vessel called <hi rend="italic">Scorpion</hi>, flying the flag of
                                the United States, had entered the harbor of Santa Catalina, a port
                                that is not open, and situated in the Dalla Costa district of the
                                State of Guayana; that an officer in uniform went ashore from said
                                war vessel and returned on board accompanied by a gentleman called
                                Boynton, an employee of the company which has its agency at said
                                port, and that no explanation was given for this flagrant violation
                                of the usual formalities.</p>
                            <p>The grave nature of this act, violating, as it does, the very
                                principles on which national sovereignty are based, compels the
                                Supreme Chief of the Republic to respectfully call the attention of
                                the Government of the United States to this delicate question, and
                                to protest in the most solemn manner against the action of the
                                man-of-war <hi rend="italic">Scorpion</hi> as opposed to the
                                principles of international law and a violation of the laws of this
                                Republic.</p>
                            <p>In compliance with an imperative duty, I have directed the foregoing

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: I have the honor to
                                acknowledge receipt of your note of February 9 in which you state
                                that an American war vessel, the <hi rend="italic">Scorpion</hi>,
                                has been seen in the Orinoco River at Santa Catalina and that her
                                presence there was not in conformity with certain sections of the
                                law of Venezuela, which, as I gather from your note, provides that
                                foreign men-of-war shall not enter the Orinoco River for scientific
                                purposes without first having asked permission of the chief of the
                                Venezuelan Government. I was not aware that there was a law in force
                                closing the Orinoco River to the public vessels of a friendly nation
                                bent on the peaceful and inoffensive mission of seeking information
                                from its nationals engaged in lawful business on the banks of that
                                stream. It is true that when it was desired to do certain scientific
                                work for the benefit of navigation and the shipping of all nations
                                at the bars of the Orinoco and San Juan rivers, the formal
                                permission of the Venezuelan Government was asked; but in these
                                cases it was deemed necessary to keep a war vessel in Venezuelan
                                waters for many weeks, and the officers and men on these scientific
                                expeditions were at work in small boats taking many observations and
                                measurements, so it was only natural that their presence for a long
                                period, and their activity, should be explained in the form of
                                asking permission for the performance of the task in question.</p>

                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Scorpion</hi>, as I understand it, recently
                                made a very quick trip to Santa Catalina and immediately returned to
                                the coast. Her visit was of course wholly inoffensive in character
                                and devoid of significance in any other sense than the one I have
                                the honor to indicate, and, as your excellency knows, there are
                                precedents for the informal visits on the part of war vessels of a

                                >Scorpion</hi>, with a translation.</p>
                        <p>On Tuesday last the minister of foreign affairs said he would send me a
                            list of the closed ports, and I was led to believe that the incident
                            would be closed in that way, but it seems that such is not the case. I
                            purposely made my answer to the minister’s first note a little vague,
                            because I was not fully acquainted with all of the facts concerning the
                                <hi rend="italic">Scorpion.</hi></p>
                        <p>I regret to say that the legation does not own a set of the laws of
                            Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>I inclose a copy of my answer to the minister’s second note. It seems to
                            me that nothing further ought to be expected.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: Referring to your
                                excellency’s note of the 16th of the present month, I am sorry that
                                I did not succeed in explaining with sufficient clearness in my note
                                of the 9th, No. 208, the spirit of the law of the 15th of May, 1882,
                                regarding the entrance of foreign men-of-war in the ports of the
                                Republic. I stated that the above-mentioned law “gives to the head
                                of the Government the power to grant or not, in his judgment,
                                permission to foreign men-of-war to enter, for scientific purposes,
                                ports that are not open.” I could not refer in a general sense to
                                the Orinoco, as Ciudad Bolivar, situated on one of its banks, is a
                                port open to foreign commerce, in accordance with the provisions of
                                Law XIV of the finance code.</p>
                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Scorpion</hi> entered Santa Catalina, a port
                                not open to foreign commerce, which constituted a distinct violation
                                of the law, and of which I spoke to you in the name of the Supreme
                                Chief of the Republic.</p>
                            <p>In a communication of July 1, 1882, the law in question was made
                                known to all the diplomatic corps resident in Caracas soon after it
                                was passed by the Congress of the Republic. Said law is the same one
                                cited by one of my predecessors to your legation in notes of January
                                14 and April 20, 1899, and the same law that another of my
                                predecessors referred to in notes of December 19 and December 23,
                                1899.</p>
                            <p>So that when, in the note protesting against the act of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Scorpion</hi>, mention was made of the law of
                                1882, it was done with the idea that attention was being called to a
                                well-known public act, an act that had been made known to foreign
                                Governments, inserted in the official compilation of laws, and
                                referred to frequently in the correspondence <pb n="545"
                                    xml:id="pg_545" facs="0625"/>with the representatives of
                                friendly nations. The existence of said law, and the knowledge of
                                its existence on the part of other Governments, fully justifies and
                                makes obligatory in the name of the sovereignty of the Republic, the
                                protest contained in my note of the 9th of the present month, and
                                which I hereby confirm by order of the chief of the Venezuelan
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>In regard to the list of the ports, rivers, and harbors which your
                                excellency asks for I need only refer to Law XIV of the finance
                                code, which specifies the points open to foreign commerce, and these
                                are the only ones in which foreign men-of-war may enter; and article
                                3 of said law establishes the only exception which can only by made
                                effective by means of a special permit from the chief of the
                                Republic.</p>
                            <p>Accept, etc.,</p>

                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: I have the honor to
                                acknowledge receipt of your note of February 26, relating to the
                                visit of the United States man-of-war <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Scorpion</hi> to Santa Catalina, in the Orinoco River, and the
                                protest made by the supreme chief of the Republic.</p>
                            <p>I will forward your excellency’s note to Washington by the first
                                mail, whither all of the correspondence concerning the matter has
                                been sent.</p>
                            <p>I desire to repeat in this connection that the visit of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Scorpion</hi> was wholly inoffensive in character,
                                and that I trust it will be so understood. There is nothing further
                                from the desire of my Government than to give offense to the
                                Government of Venezuela, and I trust your excellency, who so well
                                understands this, will assure the supreme chief of the Republic that
                                it is the sincere purpose of the United States Government at all
                                times to further strengthen the cordial relations that have long
                                existed between it and the Government of Venezuela.</p>
                            <p>There does not seem to be in this legation a copy of the laws to
                                which your excellency refers, but I shall try to obtain one at my
                                earliest convenience.</p>

                                copy of a letter from the United States minister to Venezuela to the

                                that country, and a copy of the translation of the reply

                            <p>In the practice of this Department there is a distinct and
                                well-recognized difference between the visit of a man-of-war and a
                                visit for “scientific purposes,” such scientific purposes being
                                usually hydrographic and occasionally topographic examination of
                                territorial waters or shores of a foreign country.</p>
                            <p>The Department would ordinarily not order one of its vessels to any
                                port of any country having a recognized Government to conduct
                                surveys or examinations, without having first not only notified that
                                Government of its wish, but having obtained explicit permission for
                                conducting the survey upon the occasion of the visit.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, it would neither send notice nor request
                                permission in case the visit was not undertaken for the purposes of
                                conducting such survey or other similar purpose, unless the waters
                                proposed to be visited were expressly denied to passage of
                                men-of-war by national decree, as in the case of the Amazon.</p>

                            bolivars, and of this amount 1,223,200 bolivars were recognized.</p>
                        <p>In the list of foreign claimants appear the names of Richard Morgan
                            Olcott and Felipe Soto Linares, North Americans. Mr. Olcott’s claim is
                            stated to be 100,000 bolivars, all of which is recognized. The 100,000
                            bolivars due Mr. Olcott is not in the nature of a claim to be passed
                            upon by the commission, but is the second payment due in accordance with
                            an agreement entered into by Mr. Olcott with the Venezuelan Government
                            on the 12th of December, 1900, and it would appear that this is an
                            attempt to pay it with the scrip to be issued for the debts recognized
                            by this commission. The other North American mentioned is a Porto Rican,
                            whose claim I know nothing of.</p>
                        <p>The foreigners whose claims were allowed by the commission are as
                            follows: Italians, 38; Turks, 1; Germans, 7; Spanish, 2; Colombian, 2;
                            French, 1; Arab, 1; Dane, 1; North American, 2; total, 55.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I would state that several of the foreign ministers
                            have approached me lately and suggested that there should be some
                            combined action in regard to claims. In accordance with instructions the
                            Venezuelan Government has been informed several times that our
                            Government could see no reason for departing from its practice of
                            treating the claims of its nationals only on a diplomatic basis, and the
                            only answer to these representations was in the case of the claim of
                            Ford Dix, which was forwarded to the Department.</p>
                        <p>In case a meeting of the diplomatic corps is called for concerted action
                            I will cable for specific instructions.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that the
                            Government has issued a decree in reference to the claims allowed by the
                            late claims commission.</p>
                        <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0631"/>
                        <p>The decree states that as the Government is at present short of cash with
                            which to meet these obligations, the matter is referred to the next
                            Congress which will decide as to how the claims shall be paid.</p>
                        <p>In the list I inclosed in a former dispatch you will notice that the
                            largest number of claims passed on by the commission were from Italians.
                            Italy has a clause in her treaty with Venezuela by which claims against
                            Venezuela from Italians must be submitted to the Venezuelan tribunals,
                            and this would appear as the reason why so many Italian claims were
                            presented to the commission. “La Voce d’ Italia,” an important Italian
                            journal of this city, published an article last week stating that,
                            although Italian claims had been presented to the commission, it had
                            been done with the understanding that the Italian Government was not
                            bound by the decision of the commission, and that there could always be
                            an appeal to the legation. Whether this was an authorized statement is
                            not known, but the Government organ here, commenting upon the article of
                            “La Voce d’Italia,” made it the occasion for a violent attack on all
                            foreigners, stating that they were here for no other purpose than to
                            rifle the national treasury.</p>

                            giving or withholding therein its consent. The keys of the Colombian
                            legation were delivered to Mr. Russell by the Colombian minister on the
                            12th. Inclosed you will find a copy of the agreement between the
                            Colombian minister and Mr. Russell in regard to the duties to be assumed
                            by the latter.</p>
                        <p>It would appear from the foregoing statements, together with the
                            inclosure, that no request has been made of this legation to take charge
                            of the interests of Colombia in Venezuela; and that Mr. Russell, and he
                            only, is authorized or obliged to take charge of the Colombian legation,
                            property, and archives.</p>

                        <p>As communication by cablegram or letter between Colombia and Venezuela
                            may be impossible, I would respectfully suggest that any modification of

                            Government desires us to assume should be settled by direct

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that I attended
                            this afternoon at the German legation a reception given by the chargé to
                            the German colony at Caracas and the officers of the German war ship <hi
                                rend="italic">Vineta</hi>, now at La Guaira. About 250 Germans were
                            present, not counting the band of the <hi rend="italic">Vineta</hi>.
                            While there I made a short friendly speech, in which I referred to the
                            pride we Americans take in the German part of our population, and to the
                            good will that exists between us and the Germans whenever and wherever
                            we meet.</p>
                        <p>Whatever were the shortcomings of my speech, they were evidently
                            completely forgotten when I concluded it by raising my glass on high and
                            proposing the health of the Emperor and his navy. The chargé and the
                            captain of the <hi rend="italic">Vineta</hi> replied very gracefully to
                            my speech, and called for cheers—first for the President and people of
                            the United States, and then for the American Navy. The cheers were given
                            with remarkable enthusiasm, and then the band played the Star-Spangled
                            Banner and the German national anthem.</p>
