                <head>Message of the President</head>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">To the Senate and House of
                        Representatives:</hi></p>
                <p>It gives me pleasure to extend greeting to the Fifty-fifth Congress, assembled in
                    regular session at the seat of Government, with many of whose Senators and
                    Representatives I have been associated in the legislative service. Their meeting
                    occurs under felicitous conditions, justifying sincere congratulation and
                    calling for our grateful acknowledgment to a beneficent Providence which has so
                    signally blessed and prospered us as a nation. Peace and good will with all the
                    nations of the earth continue unbroken.</p>
                <p>A matter of genuine satisfaction is the growing feeling of fraternal regard and
                    unification of all sections of our country, the incompleteness of which has too
                    long delayed realization of the highest blessings of the Union. The spirit of
                    patriotism is universal and is ever increasing in fervor. The public questions
                    which now most engross us are lifted far above either partisanship, prejudice or
                    former sectional differences. They affect every part of our common country alike
                    and permit of no division on ancient lines. Questions of foreign policy, of
                    revenue, the soundness of the currency, the inviolability of national
                    obligations, the improvement of the public service, appeal to the individual
                    conscience of every earnest citizen to whatever party he belongs or in whatever
                    section of the country he may reside.</p>
                <p>The extra session of this Congress which closed during July last enacted
                    important legislation, and while its full effect has not yet been realized, what
                    it has already accomplished assures us of its timeliness and wisdom. To test its
                    permanent value further time will be required, and the people, satisfied with
                    its operation and results thus far, are in no mind to withhold from it a fair
                    trial.</p>
                <p>Tariff legislation having been settled by the extra session of Congress, the
                    question next pressing for consideration is that of the currency.</p>
                <p>The work of putting our finances upon a sound basis, difficult as it may seem,
                    will appear easier when we recall the financial operations <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0008"/>of the Government since 1866. On the thirtieth
                    day of June of that year we had outstanding demand liabilities in the sum of
                    $728,868,447.41. On the first of January, 1879, these liabilities had been
                    reduced to $443,889,495.88. Of our interest-bearing obligations, the figures are
                    even more striking. On July 1, 1866, the principal of the interest-bearing debt
                    of the Government was $2,332,331,208. On the first day of July, 1893, this sum
                    had been reduced to $585,037,100, or an aggregate reduction of $1,747,294,108.
                    The interest-bearing debt of the United States on the first day of December,
                    1897, was $847,365,620. The Government money now outstanding (December 1)
                    consists of $346,681,016 of United States notes, $107,793,280 of Treasury notes
                    issued by authority of the law of 1890, $384,963,504 of silver certificates, and
                    $61,280,761 of standard silver dollars.</p>
                <p>With the great resources of the Government and with the honorable example of the
                    past before us, we ought not to hesitate to enter upon a currency revision which
                    will make our demand obligations less onerous to the Government and relieve our
                    financial laws from ambiguity and doubt.</p>
                <p>The brief review of what was accomplished from the close of the war to 1893,
                    makes unreasonable and groundless any distrust either of our financial ability
                    or soundness; while the situation from 1893 to 1897 must admonish Congress of
                    the immediate necessity of so legislating as to make the return of the
                    conditions then prevailing impossible.</p>
                <p>There are many plans proposed as a remedy for the evil. Before we can find the
                    true remedy we must appreciate the real evil. It is not that our currency of
                    every kind is not good, for every dollar of it is good; good because the
                    Government’s pledge is out to keep it so, and that pledge will not be broken.
                    However, the guaranty of our purpose to keep the pledge will be best shown by
                    advancing toward its fulfillment.</p>
                <p>The evil of the present system is found in the great cost to the Government of
                    maintaining the parity of our different forms of money, that is, keeping all of
                    them at par with gold. We surely can not be longer heedless of the burden this
                    imposes upon the people, even under fairly prosperous conditions, while the past
                    four years have demonstrated that it is not only an expensive charge upon the
                    Government, but a dangerous menace to the National credit.</p>
                <p>It is manifest that we must devise some plan to protect the Government against
                    bond issues for repeated redemptions. We must either curtail the opportunity for
                    speculation, made easy by the multiplied redemptions of our demand obligations,
                    or increase the gold reserve <pb n="IX" xml:id="pg_IX" facs="0009"/>for their
                    redemption. We have $900,000,000 of currency which the Government by solemn
                    enactment has undertaken to keep at par with gold. Nobody is obliged to redeem
                    in gold but the Government. The banks are not required to redeem in gold. The
                    Government is obliged to keep equal with gold all its outstanding currency and
                    coin obligations, while its receipts are not required to be paid in gold. They
                    are paid in every kind of money but gold, and the only means by which the
                    Government can with certainty get gold is by borrowing. It can get it in no
                    other way when it most needs it. The Government without any fixed gold revenue
                    is pledged to maintain gold redemption, which it has steadily and faithfully
                    done and which under the authority now given it will continue to do.</p>
                <p>The law which requires the Government after having redeemed its United States
                    notes to pay them out again as current funds demands a constant replenishment of
                    the gold reserve. This is especially so in times of business panic and when the
                    revenues are insufficient to meet the expenses of the Government. At such times
                    the Government has no other way to supply its deficit and maintain redemption
                    but through the increase of its bonded debt, as during the Administration of my
                    predecessor when $262,315,400 of four-and-a-half per cent, bonds were issued and
                    sold and the proceeds used to pay the expenses of the Government in excess of
                    the revenues and sustain the gold reserve. While it is true that the greater
                    part of the proceeds of these bonds were used to supply deficient revenues, a
                    considerable portion was required to maintain the gold reserve.</p>
                <p>With our revenues equal to our expenses, there would be no deficit requiring the
                    issuance of bonds. But if the gold reserve falls below $100,000,000, how will it
                    be replenished except by selling more bonds? Is there any other way practicable
                    under existing law? The serious question then is, shall we continue the policy
                    that has been pursued in the past; that is, when the gold reserve reaches the
                    point of danger, issue more bonds and supply the needed gold, or shall we
                    provide other means to prevent these recurring drains upon the gold reserve? If
                    no further legislation is had and the policy of selling bonds is to be
                    continued, then Congress should give the Secretary of the Treasury authority to
                    sell bonds at long or short periods, bearing a less rate of interest than is now
                    authorized by law.</p>
                <p>I earnestly recommend as soon as the receipts of the Government are quite
                    sufficient to pay all the expenses of the Government, that when any of the
                    United States notes are presented for redemption <pb n="X" xml:id="pg_X" facs="0010"/>in gold and are redeemed in gold, such, notes shall be kept and
                    set apart, and only paid out in exchange for gold. This is an obvious duty. If
                    the holder of the United States note prefers the gold and gets it from the
                    Government, he should not receive back from the Government a United States note
                    without paying gold in exchange for it. The reason for this is made all the more
                    apparent when the Government issues an interest-bearing debt to provide gold for
                    the redemption of United States notes—a non-interest-bearing debt. Surely it
                    should not pay them out again except on demand and for gold. If they are put out
                    in any other way, they may return again to be followed by another bond issue to
                    redeem them—another interest-bearing debt to redeem a non-interest-bearing
                    debt.</p>
                <p>In my view it is of the utmost importance that the Government should be relieved
                    from the burden of providing all the gold required for exchanges and export.
                    This responsibility is alone borne by the Government without any of the usual
                    and necessary banking powers to help itself. The banks do not feel the strain of
                    gold redemption. The whole strain rests upon the Government and the size of the
                    gold reserve in the Treasury has come to be, with or without reason, the signal
                    of danger or of security. This ought to be stopped.</p>
                <p>If we are to have an era of prosperity in the country, with sufficient receipts
                    for the expenses of the Government, we may feel no immediate embarrassment from
                    our present currency; but the danger still exists and will be ever present
                    menacing us so long as the existing system continues. And besides it is in times
                    of adequate revenues and business tranquillity that the Government should
                    prepare for the worst. We can not avoid without serious consequences the wise
                    consideration and prompt solution of this question.</p>
                <p>The Secretary of the Treasury has outlined a plan in great detail, for the
                    purpose of removing the threatened recurrence of a depleted gold reserve and
                    save us from future embarrassment on that account. To this plan I invite your
                    careful consideration.</p>
                <p>I concur with the Secretary of the Treasury in his recommendation that National
                    banks be allowed to issue notes to the face value of the bonds which they have
                    deposited for circulation, and that the tax on circulating notes secured by
                    deposit of such bonds be reduced to one-half of one per cent, per annum. I also
                    join him in recommending that authority be given for the establishment of
                    National banks with a minimum capital of $25,000. This will enable the smaller
                    villages and agricultural regions of the country to be supplied with currency to
                    meet their needs.</p>
                <p>I recommend that the issue of National bank notes be restricted <pb n="XI" xml:id="pg_XI" facs="0011"/>to the denomination of ten dollars and upwards.
                    If the suggestions I have herein made shall have the approval of Congress, then
                    I would recommend that National banks be required to redeem their notes in
                    gold.</p>
                <p>The most important problem with which this Government is now called upon to deal
                    pertaining to its foreign relations concerns its duty toward Spain and the Cuban
                    insurrection. Problems and conditions more or less in common with those now
                    existing have confronted this Government at various times in the past. The story
                    of Cuba for many years has been one of unrest; growing discontent; an effort
                    toward a larger enjoyment of liberty and self-control; of organized resistance
                    to the mother country; of depression after distress and warfare and of
                    ineffectual settlement to be followed by renewed revolt. For no enduring period
                    since the enfranchisements of the continental possessions of Spain in the
                    Western continent has the condition of Cuba or the policy of Spain toward Cuba
                    not caused concern to the United States.</p>
                <p>The prospect from time to time that the weakness of Spain’s hold upon the Island
                    and the political vicissitudes and embarrassments of the home government might
                    lead to the transfer of Cuba to a continental power called forth, between 1823
                    and 1860, various emphatic declarations of the policy of the United States to
                    permit no disturbance of Cuba’s connection with Spain unless in the direction of
                    independence or acquisition by us through purchase; nor has there been any
                    change of this declared policy since upon the part of the Government.</p>
                <p>The revolution which began in 1868 lasted for ten years despite the strenuous
                    efforts of the successive peninsular governments to suppress it. Then as now the
                    Government of the United States testified its grave concern and offered its aid
                    to put an end to bloodshed in Cuba. The overtures made by General Grant were
                    refused and the war dragged on, entailing great loss of life and treasure and
                    increased injury to American interests besides throwing enhanced burdens of
                    neutrality upon this Government. In 1878 peace was brought about by the Truce of
                    Zanjon, obtained by negotiations between the Spanish Commander, Martinez de
                    Campos, and the insurgent leaders.</p>
                <p>The present insurrection broke out in February, 1895. It is not my purpose at
                    this time to recall its remarkable increase or to characterize its tenacious
                    resistance against the enormous forces massed against it by Spain. The revolt
                    and the efforts to subdue it carried destruction to every Quarter of the Island,
                    developing wide proportions <pb n="XII" xml:id="pg_XII" facs="0012"/>and defying
                    the efforts of Spain for its suppression. The civilized code of war has been
                    disregarded, no less so by the Spaniards than by the Cubans.</p>
                <p>The existing conditions can not but fill this Government and the American people
                    with the gravest apprehension. There is no desire on the part of our people to
                    profit by the misfortunes of Spain. We have only the desire to see the Cubans
                    prosperous and contented, enjoying that measure of self-control which is the
                    inalienable right of man, protected in their right to reap the benefit of the
                    exhaustless treasures of their country.</p>
                <p>The offer made by my predecessor in April, 1896, tendering the friendly offices
                    of this Government failed. Any mediation on our part was not accepted. In brief
                    the answer read: “There is no effectual way to pacify Cuba unless it begins with
                    the actual submission of the rebels to the mother country.” Then only could
                    Spain act in the promised direction, of her own motion and after her own
                    plans.</p>
                <p>The cruel policy of concentration was initiated February 16, 1896. The productive
                    districts controlled by the Spanish armies were depopulated. The agricultural
                    inhabitants were herded in and about the garrison towns, their lands laid waste
                    and their dwellings destroyed. This policy the late Cabinet of Spain justified
                    as a necessary measure of war and as a means of cutting off supplies from the
                    insurgents. It has utterly failed as a war measure. It was not civilized
                    warfare. It was extermination.</p>
                <p>Against this abuse of the rights of war I have felt constrained on repeated
                    occasions to enter the firm and earnest protest of this Government. There was
                    much of public condemnation of the treatment of American citizens by alleged
                    illegal arrests and long imprisonment awaiting trial or pending protracted
                    judicial proceedings. I felt it my first duty to make instant demand for the
                    release or speedy trial of all American citizens under arrest. Before the change
                    of the Spanish Cabinet in October last twenty-two prisoners, citizens of the
                    United States, had been given their freedom.</p>
                <p>For the relief of our own citizens suffering because of the conflict the aid of
                    Congress was sought in a special message, and under the appropriation of April
                    4, 1897, effective aid has been given to American citizens in Cuba, many of them
                    at their own request having been returned to the United States.</p>
                <p>The instructions given to our new Minister to Spain before his departure for his
                    post directed him to impress upon that Government the sincere wish of the United
                    States to lend its aid toward the ending of the war in Cuba by reaching a
                    peaceful and lasting <pb n="XIII" xml:id="pg_XIII" facs="0013"/>result, just and
                    honorable alike to Spain and to the Cuban people. These instructions recited the
                    character and duration of the contest, the widespread losses it entails, the
                    burdens and restraints it imposes upon us, with constant disturbance of National
                    interests, and the injury resulting from an indefinite continuance of this state
                    of things. It was stated that at this juncture our Government was constrained to
                    seriously inquire if the time was not ripe when Spain of her own volition, moved
                    by her own interests and every sentiment of humanity, should put a stop to this
                    destructive war and make proposals of settlement honorable to herself and just
                    to her Cuban colony. It was urged that as a neighboring nation, with large
                    interests in Cuba, we could be required to wait only a reasonable time for the
                    mother country to establish its authority and restore peace and order within the
                    borders of the Island; that we could not contemplate an indefinite period for
                    the accomplishment of this result.</p>
                <p>No solution was proposed to which the slightest idea of humiliation to Spain
                    could attach, and indeed precise proposals were withheld to avoid embarrassment
                    to that Government. All that was asked or expected was that some safe way might
                    be speedily provided and permanent peace restored. It so chanced that the
                    consideration of this offer, addressed to the same Spanish Administration which
                    had declined the tenders of my predecessor and which for more than two years had
                    poured men and treasure into Cuba in the fruitless effort to suppress the
                    revolt, fell to others. Between the departure of General Woodford, the new
                    Envoy, and his arrival in Spain the statesman who had shaped the policy of his
                    country fell by the hand of an assassin, and although the Cabinet of the late
                    Premier still held office and received from our Envoy the proposals he bore,
                    that Cabinet gave place within a few days thereafter to a new Administration,
                    under the leadership of Sagasta.</p>
                <p>The reply to our note was received on the 23rd day of October. It is in the
                    direction of a better understanding. It appreciates the friendly purposes of
                    this Government. It admits that our country is deeply affected by the war in
                    Cuba and that its desires for peace are just. It declares that the present
                    Spanish Government is bound by every consideration to a change of policy that
                    should satisfy the United States and pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To
                    this end Spain has decided to put into effect the political reforms heretofore
                    advocated by the present Premier, without halting for any consideration in the
                    path which in its judgment leads to peace. The military operations, it is said,
                        <pb n="XIV" xml:id="pg_XIV" facs="0014"/>will continue but will be humane
                    and conducted with all regard for private rights, being accompanied by political
                    action leading to the autonomy of Cuba while guarding Spanish sovereignty. This,
                    it is claimed, will result in investing Cuba with a distinct personality; the
                    Island to be governed by an Executive and by a Local Council or Chamber,
                    reserving to Spain the control of the foreign relations, the army and navy and
                    the judicial administration. To accomplish this the present Government proposes
                    to modify existing legislation by decree, leaving the Spanish Cortes, with the
                    aid of Cuban Senators and Deputies, to solve the economic problem and properly
                    distribute the existing debt.</p>
                <p>In the absence of a declaration of the measures that this Government proposes to
                    take in carrying out its proffer of good offices it suggests that Spain be left
                    free to conduct military operations and grant political reforms, while the
                    United States for its part shall enforce its neutral obligations and cut off the
                    assistance which it is asserted the insurgents receive from this country. The
                    supposition of an indefinite prolongation of the war is denied. It is asserted
                    that the western provinces are already well-nigh reclaimed; that the planting of
                    cane and tobacco therein has been resumed, and that by force of arms and new and
                    ample reforms very early and complete pacification is hoped for.</p>
                <p>The immediate amelioration of existing conditions under the new administration of
                    Cuban affairs is predicted, and therewithal the disturbance and all occasion for
                    any change of attitude on the part of the United States. Discussion of the
                    question of the international duties and responsibilities of the United States
                    as Spain understands them is presented, with an apparent disposition to charge
                    us with failure in this regard. This charge is without any basis in fact. It
                    could not have been made if Spain had been cognizant of the constant efforts
                    this Government has made at the cost of millions and by the employment of the
                    administrative machinery of the nation at command to perform its full duty
                    according to the law of nations. That it has successfully prevented the
                    departure of a single military expedition or armed vessel from our shores in
                    violation of our laws would seem to be a sufficient answer. But of this aspect
                    of the Spanish note it is not necessary to speak further now. Firm in the
                    conviction of a wholly performed obligation, due response to this charge has
                    been made in diplomatic course.</p>
                <p>Throughout all these horrors and dangers to our own peace this Government has
                    never in any way abrogated its sovereign prerogative of reserving to itself the
                    determination of its policy and course <pb n="XV" xml:id="pg_XV" facs="0015"/>according to its own high sense of right and in consonance with the dearest
                    interests and convictions of our own people should the prolongation of the
                    strife so demand.</p>
                <p>Of the untried measures there remain only: Recognition of the insurgents as
                    belligerents; recognition of the independence of Cuba; neutral intervention to
                    end the war by imposing a rational compromise between the contestants, and
                    intervention in favor of one or the other party. I speak not of forcible
                    annexation, for that can not be thought of. That by our code of morality would
                    be criminal aggression.</p>
                <p>Recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban insurgents has often been canvassed
                    as a possible if not inevitable step both in regard to the previous ten years’
                    struggle and during the present war. I am not unmindful that the two Houses of
                    Congress in the spring of 1896 expressed the opinion by concurrent resolution
                    that a condition of public war existed requiring or justifying the recognition
                    of a state of belligerency in Cuba, and during the extra session the Senate
                    voted a joint resolution of like import, which however was not brought to a vote
                    in the House of Representatives. In the presence of these significant
                    expressions of the sentiment of the Legislative branch it behooves the Executive
                    to soberly consider the conditions under which so important a measure must needs
                    rest for justification. It is to be seriously considered whether the Cuban
                    insurrection possesses beyond dispute the attributes of Statehood which alone
                    can demand the recognition of belligerency in its favor. Possession, in short,
                    of the essential qualifications of sovereignty by the insurgents and the conduct
                    of the war by them according to the received code of war are no less important
                    factors toward the determination of the problem of belligerency than are the
                    influences and consequences of the struggle upon the internal polity of the
                    recognizing State.</p>
                <p>The wise utterances of President Grant in his memorable message of December 7,
                    1875, are signally relevant to the present situation in Cuba and it may be
                    wholesome now to recall them. At that time a ruinous conflict had for seven
                    years wasted the neighboring Island. During all those years an utter disregard
                    of the laws of civilized warfare and of the just demands of humanity, which
                    called forth expressions of condemnation from the nations of Christendom,
                    continued unabated. Desolation and ruin pervaded that productive region,
                    enormously affecting the commerce of all commercial nations, but that of the
                    United States more than any other by reason of proximity and larger trade and
                    intercourse. At that <pb n="XVI" xml:id="pg_XVI" facs="0016"/>juncture General
                    Grant uttered these words, which now as then sum up the elements of the
                    problem:</p>
                <p>“A recognition of the independence of Cuba being, in my opinion, impracticable,
                    and indefensible, the question which next presents itself is that of the
                    recognition of belligerent rights in the parties to the contest. In a former
                    message to Congress I had occasion to consider this question, and reached the
                    conclusion that the conflict in Cuba, dreadful and devastating as were its
                    incidents, did not rise to the fearful dignity of war.* * * It is possible that
                    the acts of foreign powers, and even acts of Spain herself, of this very nature,
                    might be pointed to in defense of such recognition. But now, as in its past
                    history, the United States should carefully avoid the false lights which might
                    lead it into the mazes of doubtful law and of questionable propriety, and adhere
                    rigidly and sternly to the rule, which has been its guide, of doing only that
                    which is right and honest and of good report. The question of according or of
                    withholding rights of belligerency must be judged in every case, in view of the
                    particular attending facts. Unless justified by necessity, it is always, and
                    justly, regarded as an unfriendly act and a gratuitous demonstration of moral
                    support to the rebellion. It is necessary, and it is required, when the
                    interests and rights of another government or of its people are so far affected
                    by a pending civil conflict as to require a definition of its relations to the
                    parties thereto. But this conflict must be one which will be recognized in the
                    sense of international law as war.</p>
                <p>“Belligerence, too, is a fact. The mere existence of contending armed bodies, and
                    their occasional conflicts, do not constitute war in the sense referred to.
                    Applying to the existing condition of affairs in Cuba the tests recognized by
                    publicists and writers on international law, and which have been observed by
                    nations of dignity, honesty and power, when free from sensitive or selfish and
                    unworthy motives, I fail to find in the insurrection the existence of such a
                    substantial political organization, real, palpable and manifest to the world,
                    having the forms and capable of the ordinary functions of government toward its
                    own people and to other states, with courts for the administration of justice,
                    with a local habitation, possessing such organization of force, such material,
                    such occupation of territory as to take the contest out of the category of a
                    mere rebellious insurrection, or occasional skirmishes, and place it on the
                    terrible footing of war, to which a recognition of belligerency would aim to
                    elevate it.</p>
                <p>“The contest, moreover, is solely on land; the insurrection has not possessed
                    itself of a single seaport whence it may send forth its <pb n="XVII" xml:id="pg_XVII" facs="0017"/>flag, nor has it any means of communication
                    with foreign powers except through the military lines of its adversaries. No
                    apprehension of any of those sudden and difficult complications which a war upon
                    the ocean is apt to precipitate upon the vessels, both commercial and national,
                    and upon the consular officers of other powers, calls for the definition of
                    their relations to the parties to the contest. Considered as a question of
                    expediency, I regard the accordance of belligerent rights still to be as unwise
                    and premature, as I regard it to be, at present, indefensible as a measure of
                    right.</p>
                <p>“Such recognition entails upon the country according the rights which flow from
                    it difficult and complicated duties, and requires the exaction from the
                    contending parties of the strict observance of their rights and obligations. It
                    confers the right of search upon the high seas by vessels of both parties; it
                    would subject the carrying of arms and munitions of war, which now may be
                    transported freely and without interruption, in vessels of the United States, to
                    detention and to possible seizure; it would give rise to countless vexatious
                    questions, would release the parent government from responsibility for acts done
                    “by the insurgents, and would invest Spain with the right to exercise the
                    supervision recognized by our treaty of 1795 over our commerce on the high seas,
                    a very large part of which, in its traffic between the Atlantic and the Gulf
                    States, and between all of them and the States on the Pacific, passes through
                    the waters which wash the shores of Cuba. The exercise of this supervision could
                    scarce fail to lead, if not to abuses, certainly to collisions perilous to the
                    peaceful relations of the two States. There can be little doubt as to what
                    result such supervision would before long draw this nation. It would be unworthy
                    of the United States to inaugurate the possibilities of such result, by measures
                    of questionable right or expediency, or by any indirection.”</p>
                <p>Turning to the practical aspects of a recognition of belligerency and reviewing
                    its inconveniences and positive dangers, still further pertinent considerations
                    appear. In the code of nations there is no such thing as a naked recognition of
                    belligerency unaccompanied by the assumption of international neutrality. Such
                    recognition without more will not confer upon either party to a domestic
                    conflict a status not theretofore actually possessed or affect the relation of
                    either party to other States. The act of recognition usually takes the form of a
                    solemn proclamation of neutrality which recites the de facto condition of
                    belligerency as its motive. It announces a domestic law of neutrality in the
                    declaring State. It assumes the international obligations of a neutral in the
                    presence of a public state of war. It warns all citizens and others within the
                    jurisdiction of the <pb n="XVIII" xml:id="pg_XVIII" facs="0018"/>proclaimant
                    that they violate those rigorous obligations at their own peril and can not
                    expect to be shielded from the consequences. The right of visit and search on
                    the seas and seizure of vessels and cargoes and contraband of war and good prize
                    under admiralty law must under international law be admitted as a legitimate
                    consequence of a proclamation of belligerency. While according the equal
                    belligerent rights defined by public law to each party in our ports disfavors
                    would be imposed on both, which while nominally equal would weigh heavily in
                    behalf of Spain herself. Possessing a navy and controlling the ports of Cuba her
                    maritime rights could be asserted not only for the military investment of the
                    Island but up to the margin of our own territorial waters, and a condition of
                    things would exist for which the Cubans within their own domain could not hope
                    to create a parallel; while its creation through aid or sympathy from within our
                    domain would be even more impossible than now, with the additional obligations
                    of international neutrality we would perforce assume.</p>
                <p>The enforcement of this enlarged and onerous code of neutrality would only be
                    influential within our own jurisdiction by land and sea and applicable by our
                    own instrumentalities. It could impart to the United States no jurisdiction
                    between Spain and the insurgents. It would give the United States no right of
                    intervention to enforce the conduct of the strife within the paramount authority
                    of Spain according to the international code of war.</p>
                <p>For these reasons I regard the recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban
                    insurgents as now unwise and therefore inadmissible. Should that step hereafter
                    be deemed wise as a measure of right and duty the Executive will take it.</p>
                <p>Intervention upon humanitarian grounds has been frequently suggested and has not
                    failed to receive my most anxious and earnest consideration. But should such a
                    step be now taken when it is apparent that a hopeful change has supervened in
                    the policy of Spain toward Cuba? A new government has taken office in the mother
                    country. It is pledged in advance to the declaration that all the effort in the
                    world can not suffice to maintain peace in Cuba by the bayonet; that vague
                    promises of reform after subjugation afford no solution of the insular problem;
                    that with a substitution of commanders must come a change of the past system of
                    warfare for one in harmony with a new policy which shall no longer aim to drive
                    the Cubans to the “horrible alternative of taking to the thicket or succumbing
                    in misery;” that reforms must be instituted in accordance with the needs and
                    circumstances of the time, and that these reforms, while designed to give full
                    autonomy to the <pb n="XIX" xml:id="pg_XIX" facs="0019"/>colony and to create a
                    virtual entity and self-controlled administration, shall yet conserve and affirm
                    the sovereignty of Spain by a just distribution of powers and burdens upon a
                    basis of mutual interest untainted by methods of selfish expediency.</p>
                <p>The first acts of the new government lie in these honorable paths. The policy of
                    cruel rapine and extermination that so long shocked the universal sentiment of
                    humanity has been reversed. Under the new military commander a broad clemency is
                    proffered. Measures have already been set on foot to relieve the horrors of
                    starvation. The power of the Spanish armies it is asserted is to be used not to
                    spread ruin and desolation but to protect the resumption of peaceful
                    agricultural pursuits and productive industries. That past methods are futile to
                    force a peace by subjugation is freely admitted, and that ruin without
                    conciliation must inevitably fail to win for Spain the fidelity of a contented
                    dependency.</p>
                <p>Decrees in application of the foreshadowed reforms have already been promulgated.
                    The full text of these decrees has not been received, but as furnished in a
                    telegraphic summary from our Minister are: All civil and electoral rights of
                    Peninsular Spaniards are, in virtue of existing constitutional authority,
                    forthwith extended to Colonial Spaniards. A scheme of autonomy has been
                    proclaimed by decree, to become effective upon ratification by the Cortes. It
                    creates a Cuban parliament which, with the insular executive, can consider and
                    vote upon all subjects affecting local order and interests, possessing unlimited
                    powers save as to matters of state, war and the navy as to which the
                    Governor-General acts by his own authority as the delegate of the central
                    government. This parliament receives the oath of the Governor-General to
                    preserve faithfully the liberties and privileges of the colony, and to it the
                    colonial secretaries are responsible. It has the right to propose to the central
                    government, through the Governor-General, modifications of the national charter
                    and to invite new projects of law or executive measures in the interest of the
                    colony.</p>
                <p>Besides its local powers it is competent, first, to regulate electoral
                    registration and procedure and prescribe the qualifications of electors and the
                    manner of exercising suffrage; second, to organize courts of justice with native
                    judges from members of the local bar; third, to frame the insular budget both as
                    to expenditures and revenues, without limitation of any kind, and to set apart
                    the revenues to meet the Cuban share of the national budget, which latter will
                    be voted by the national Cortes with the assistance of Cuban senators and
                    deputies; fourth, to initiate or take part in the negotiations of the national
                    government for commercial treaties which may affect <pb n="XX" xml:id="pg_XX" facs="0020"/>Cuban interests; fifth, to accept or reject commercial treaties
                    which the national government may have concluded without the participation of
                    the Cuban government; sixth, to frame the colonial tariff, acting in accord with
                    the peninsular government in scheduling articles of mutual commerce between the
                    mother country and the colonies. Before introducing or voting upon a bill, the
                    Cuban government or the chambers will lay the project before the central
                    government and hear its opinion thereon, all the correspondence in such regard
                    being made public. Finally, all conflicts of jurisdiction arising between the
                    different municipal, provincial and insular assemblies, or between the latter
                    and the insular executive power, and which from their nature may not be
                    referable to the central government for decision, shall be submitted to the
                    courts.</p>
                <p>That the Government of Sagasta has entered upon a course from which recession
                    with honor is impossible can hardly be questioned; that in the few weeks it has
                    existed it has made earnest of the sincerity of its professions is undeniable. I
                    shall not impugn its sincerity, nor should impatience be suffered to embarrass
                    it in the task it has undertaken. It is honestly due to Spain and to our
                    friendly relations with Spain that she should be given a reasonable chance to
                    realize her expectations and to prove the asserted efficacy of the new order of
                    things to which she stands irrevocably committed. She has recalled the Commander
                    whose brutal orders inflamed the American mind and shocked the civilized world.
                    She has modified the horrible order of concentration and has undertaken to care
                    for the helpless and permit those who desire to resume the cultivation of their
                    fields to do so and assures them of the protection of the Spanish Government in
                    their lawful occupations. She has just released the “Competitor” prisoners
                    heretofore sentenced to death and who have been the subject of repeated
                    diplomatic correspondence during both this and the preceding Administration.</p>
                <p>Not a single American citizen is now in arrest or confinement in Cuba of whom
                    this Government has any knowledge. The near future will demonstrate whether the
                    indispensable condition of a righteous peace, just alike to the Cubans and to
                    Spain as well as equitable to all our interests so intimately involved in the
                    welfare of Cuba, is likely to be attained. If not, the exigency of further and
                    other action by the United States will remain to be taken. When that time comes
                    that action will be determined in the line of indisputable right and duty. It
                    will be faced, without misgiving or hesitancy in the light of the obligation
                    this Government owes to itself, to the people who have confided to it the
                    protection of their interests and honor, and to humanity.</p>
                <pb n="XXI" xml:id="pg_XXI" facs="0021"/>
                <p>Sure of the right, keeping free from all offense ourselves, actuated only by
                    upright and patriotic considerations, moved neither by passion nor selfishness,
                    the Government will continue its watchful care over the rights and property of
                    American citizens and will abate none of its efforts to bring about by peaceful
                    agencies a peace which shall be honorable and enduring. If it shall hereafter
                    appear to be a duty imposed by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization and
                    humanity to intervene with force, it shall be without fault on our part and only
                    because the necessity for such action will be so clear as to command the support
                    and approval of the civilized world.</p>
                <p>By a special message dated the 16th day of June last, I laid before the Senate a
                    treaty signed that day by the plenipotentiaries of the United States and of the
                    Republic of Hawaii, having for its purpose the incorporation of the Hawaiian
                    Island as an integral part of the United States and under its sovereignty. The
                    Senate having removed the injunction of secrecy, although the treaty is still
                    pending before that body, the subject may be properly referred to in this
                    Message because the necessary action of the Congress is required to determine by
                    legislation many details of the eventual union should the fact of annexation be
                    accomplished, as I believe it should be.</p>
                <p>While consistently disavowing from a very early period any aggressive policy of
                    absorption in regard to the Hawaiian group, a long series of declarations
                    through three-quarters of a century has proclaimed the vital interest of the
                    United States in the independent life of the Islands and their intimate
                    commercial dependence upon this country. At the same time it has been repeatedly
                    asserted that in no event could the entity of Hawaiian statehood cease by the
                    passage of the Islands under the domination or influence of another power than
                    the United States. Under these circumstances, the logic of events required that
                    annexation, heretofore offered but declined, should in the ripeness of time come
                    about as the natural result of the strengthening ties that bind us to those
                    Islands, and be realized by the free will of the Hawaiian State.</p>
                <p>That treaty was unanimously ratified without amendment by the Senate and
                    President of the Republic of Hawaii on the 10th of September last, and only
                    awaits the favorable action of the American Senate to effect the complete
                    absorption of the Islands into the domain of the United States. What the
                    conditions of such a union shall be, the political relation thereof to the
                    United States, the character of the local administration, the quality and degree
                    of the elective franchise of the inhabitants, the extension of the federal laws
                    to the territory on the enactment of special laws to fit the <pb n="XXII" xml:id="pg_XXII" facs="0022"/>peculiar condition thereof, the regulation if
                    need be of the labor system therein, are all matters which the treaty has wisely
                    relegated to the Congress.</p>
                <p>If the treaty is confirmed as every consideration of dignity and honor requires,
                    the wisdom of Congress will see to it that, avoiding abrupt assimilation of
                    elements perhaps hardly yet fitted to share in the highest franchises of
                    citizenship, and having due regard to the geographical conditions, the most just
                    provisions for self-rule in local matters with the largest political liberties
                    as an integral part of our Nation will be accorded to the Hawaiians. No less is
                    due to a people who, after nearly five years of demonstrated capacity to fulfill
                    the obligations of self-governing statehood, come of their free will to merge
                    their destinies in our body-politic.</p>
                <p>The questions which have arisen between Japan and Hawaii by reason of the
                    treatment of Japanese laborers emigrating to the Islands under the
                    Hawaiian-Japanese convention of 1888, are in a satisfactory stage of settlement
                    by negotiation. This Government has not been invited to mediate, and on the
                    other hand has sought no intervention in that matter, further than to evince its
                    kindliest disposition toward such a speedy and direct adjustment by the two
                    sovereign states in interest as shall comport with equity and honor. It is
                    gratifying to learn that the apprehensions at first displayed on the part of
                    Japan lest the cessation of Hawaii’s national life through annexation might
                    impair privileges to which Japan honorably laid claim, have given place to
                    confidence in the uprightness of this Government, and in the sincerity of its
                    purpose to deal with all possible ulterior questions in the broadest spirit of
                    friendliness.</p>
                <p>As to the representation of this Government to Nicaragua, Salvador and Costa
                    Rica, I have concluded that Mr. William L. Merry, cofirmed as Minister of the
                    United States to the States of Nicaragua, Salvador and Costa Rica, shall proceed
                    to San José, Costa Rica, and there temporarily establish the headquarters of the
                    United States to those three States. I took this action for what I regarded as
                    the paramount interests of this country. It was developed upon an investigation
                    by the Secretary of State that the Government of Nicaragua, while not unwilling
                    to receive Mr. Merry in his diplomatic quality, was unable to do so because of
                    the compact concluded June 20, 1895, whereby that Republic and those of Salvador
                    and Honduras, forming what is known as the Greater Republic of Central America,
                    had surrendered to the representative Diet thereof their right to receive and
                    send diplomatic <pb n="XXIII" xml:id="pg_XXIII" facs="0023"/>agents. The Diet
                    was not willing to accept him because he was not accredited to that body. I
                    could not accredit him to that body because the appropriation law of Congress
                    did not permit it. Mr. Baker, the present Minister at Managua, has been directed
                    to present his letters of recall.</p>
                <p>Mr. W. Godfrey Hunter has likewise been accredited to the Governments of
                    Guatemala and Honduras, the same as his predecessor. Guatemala is not a member
                    of the Greater Republic of Central America, but Honduras is. Should this latter
                    Government decline to receive him, he has been instructed to report this fact to
                    his Government and await its further instructions.</p>
                <p>A subject of large importance to our country and increasing appreciation on the
                    part of the people, is the completion of the great highway of trade between the
                    Atlantic and Pacific known as the Nicaragua Canal. Its utility and value to
                    American commerce is universally admitted. The Commission appointed under date
                    of July 24th last “to continue the surveys and examinations authorized by the
                    act approved March 2, 1895,” in regard to “the proper route, feasibility and
                    cost of construction of the Nicaragua Canal, with a view of making complete
                    plans for the entire work of construction of such canal,” is now employed in the
                    undertaking. In the future I shall take occasion to transmit to Congress the
                    report of this Commission, making at the same time such further suggestions as
                    may then seem advisable.</p>
                <p>Under the provisions of the act of Congress approved March 3, 1897, for the
                    promotion of an international agreement respecting bimetallism, I appointed on
                    the 14th day of April, 1897, Hon. Edward O. Wolcott of Colorado, Hon. Adlai E.
                    Stevenson of Illinois, and Hon. Charles J. Paine of Massachusetts, as Special
                    Envoys to represent the United States. They have been diligent in their efforts
                    to secure the concurrence and cooperation of European countries in the
                    international settlement of the question, but up to this time have not been able
                    to secure an agreement contemplated by their mission.</p>
                <p>The gratifying action of our great sister Republic of France in joining this
                    country in the attempt to bring about an agreement among the principal
                    commercial nations of Europe, whereby a fixed and relative value between gold
                    and silver shall be secured, furnishes assurance that we are not alone among the
                    larger nations of the world in realizing the international character of the
                    problem and in the desire of reaching some wise and practical solution of it.
                    The <pb n="XXIV" xml:id="pg_XXIV" facs="0024"/>British Government has published
                    a résumé of the steps taken jointly by the French Ambassador in London and the
                    Special Envoys of the United States, with whom our Ambassador at London actively
                    cooperated in the presentation of this subject to Her Majesty’s Government. This
                    will be laid before Congress.</p>
                <p>Our Special Envoys have not made their final report, as further negotiations
                    between the representatives of this Government and the governments of other
                    countries are pending and in contemplation. They believe that doubts which have
                    been raised in certain quarters respecting the position of maintaining the
                    stability of the parity between the metals and kindred questions may yet be
                    solved by further negotiations.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile it gives me satisfaction to state that the Special Envoys have already
                    demonstrated their ability and fitness to deal with the subject, and it is to be
                    earnestly hoped that their labors may result in an international agreement which
                    will bring about recognition of both gold and silver as money upon such terms
                    and with such safeguards as will secure the use of both metals upon a basis
                    which shall work no injustice to any class of our citizens.</p>
                <p>In order to execute as early as possible the provisions of the third and fourth
                    sections of the Revenue Act approved July 24, 1897, I appointed the Honorable
                    John A. Kasson of Iowa a Special Commissioner Plenipotentiary to undertake the
                    requisite negotiations with foreign countries desiring to avail themselves of
                    these provisions. The negotiations are now proceeding with several Governments,
                    both European and American. It is believed that by a careful exercise of the
                    powers conferred by that Act some grievances of our own and of other countries
                    in our mutual trade relations may be either removed, or largely alleviated, and
                    that the volume of our commercial exchanges may be enlarged, with advantage to
                    both contracting parties.</p>
                <p>Most desirable from every standpoint of national interest and patriotism is the
                    effort to extend our foreign commerce. To this end our merchant marine should be
                    improved and enlarged. We should do our full share of the carrying trade of the
                    world. We do not do it now. We should be the laggard no longer. The inferiority
                    of our merchant marine is justly humiliating to the national pride. The
                    Government by every proper constitutional means should aid in making our ships
                    familiar visitors at every commercial port of the world, thus opening up new and
                    valuable markets to the surplus products of the farm and the factory.</p>
                <pb n="XXV" xml:id="pg_XXV" facs="0025"/>
                <p>The efforts which had been made during the two previous years by my predecessor
                    to secure better protection to the fur seals in the North Pacific Ocean and
                    Bering Sea, were renewed at an early date by this Administration and have been
                    pursued with earnestness. Upon my invitation the Governments of Japan and Russia
                    sent delegates to Washington and an international conference was held during the
                    months of October and November last, wherein it was unanimously agreed that
                    under the existing regulations this species of useful animals was threatened
                    with extinction and that an international agreement of all the interested powers
                    was necessary for their adequate protection.</p>
                <p>The Government of Great Britain did not see proper to be represented at this
                    conference, but subsequently sent to Washington, as delegates, the expert
                    commissioners of Great Britain and Canada who had during the past two years
                    visited the Pribilof Islands, and who met in conference similar commissioners on
                    the part of the United States. The result of this conference was an agreement on
                    important facts connected with the condition of the seal herd, heretofore in
                    dispute, which should place beyond controversy the duty of the Governments
                    concerned to adopt measures without delay for the preservation and restoration
                    of the herd. Negotiations to this end are now in progress, the result of which I
                    hope to be able to report to Congress at an early day.</p>
                <p>International arbitration can not be omitted from the list of subjects claiming
                    our consideration. Events have only served to strengthen the general views on
                    this question expressed in my inaugural address. The best sentiment of the
                    civilized world is moving toward the settlement of differences between nations
                    without resorting to the horrors of war. Treaties embodying these humane
                    principles on broad lines without in any way imperiling our interests or our
                    honor shall have my constant encouragement.</p>
                <p>The acceptance by this Government of the invitation of the Republic of France to
                    participate in the Universal Exposition of 1900 at Paris was immediately
                    followed by the appointment of a Special Commissioner to represent the United
                    States in the proposed Exposition, with special reference to the securing of
                    space for an adequate exhibit on behalf of the United States.</p>
                <p>The Special Commissioner delayed his departure for Paris long enough to ascertain
                    the probable demand for space by American exhibitors. His inquiries developed an
                    almost unprecedented <pb n="XXVI" xml:id="pg_XXVI" facs="0026"/>interest in the
                    proposed Exposition, and the information thus acquired enabled him to justify an
                    application for a much larger allotment of space for the American section than
                    had been reserved by the Exposition authorities. The result was particularly
                    gratifying in view of the fact that the United States was one of the last
                    countries to accept the invitation of France.</p>
                <p>The reception accorded our Special Commissioner was most cordial and he was given
                    every reasonable assurance that the United States would receive a consideration
                    commensurate with the proportions of our exhibit. The report of the Special
                    Commissioner as to the magnitude and importance of the coming Exposition and the
                    great demand for space by American exhibitors supplies new arguments for a
                    liberal and judicious appropriation by Congress to the end that an exhibit
                    fairly representative of the industries and resources of our country may be made
                    in an Exposition which will illustrate the World’s progress during the
                    nineteenth century. That Exposition is intended to be the most important and
                    comprehensive of the long series of international exhibitions, of which our own
                    at Chicago was a brilliant example, and it is desirable that the United States
                    should make a worthy exhibit of American genius and skill and their unrivaled
                    achievements in every branch of industry.</p>
                <p>The present immediately effective force of the Navy consists of four battleships
                    of the first class, two of the second, and forty-eight other vessels, ranging
                    from armored cruisers to torpedo boats. There are under construction five
                    battleships of the first class, sixteen torpedo boats and one submarine boat. No
                    provision has yet been made for the armor of three of the five battleships, as
                    it has been impossible to obtain it at the price fixed by Congress. It is of
                    great importance that Congress provide this armor, as until then the ships are
                    of no fighting value.</p>
                <p>The present naval force, especially in view of its increase by the ships now
                    under construction, while not as large as that of a few other powers, is a
                    formidable force; its vessels are the very best of each type; and with the
                    increase that should be made to it from time to time in the future, and careful
                    attention to keeping it in a high state of efficiency and repair, it is well
                    adapted to the necessities of the country.</p>
                <p>The great increase of the Navy which has taken place in recent years was
                    justified by the requirements for national defense, and has received public
                    approbation. The time has now arrived, however, when this increase, to which the
                    country is committed, should, <pb n="XXVII" xml:id="pg_XXVII" facs="0027"/>for a
                    time, take the form of increased facilities commensurate with the increase of
                    our naval vessels. It is an unfortunate fact that there is only one dock on the
                    Pacific Coast capable of docking our largest ships, and only one on the Atlantic
                    Coast, and that the latter has for the last six or seven months been under
                    repair and therefore incapable of use. Immediate steps should be taken to
                    provide three or four docks of this capacity on the Atlantic Coast, at least one
                    on the Pacific Coast, and a floating dock in the Gulf. This is the
                    recommendation of a very competent Board, appointed to investigate the subject.
                    There should also be ample provision made for powder and projectiles, and other
                    munitions of war, and for an increased number of officers and enlisted men. Some
                    additions are also necessary to our navy-yards, for the repair and care of our
                    larger number of vessels. As there are now on the stocks five battleships of the
                    largest class, which can not be completed for a year or two, I concur with the
                    recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy for an appropriation authorizing the
                    construction of one battleship for the Pacific Coast, where, at present, there
                    is only one in commission and one under construction, while on the Atlantic
                    Coast there are three in commission and four under construction; and also that
                    several torpedo boats be authorized in connection with our general system of
                    coast defense.</p>
                <p>The Territory of Alaska requires the prompt and early attention of Congress. The
                    conditions now existing demand material changes in the laws relating to the
                    Territory. The great influx of population during the past summer and fall and
                    the prospect of a still larger immigration in the spring will not permit us to
                    longer neglect the extension of civil authority within the Territory or postpone
                    the establishment of a more thorough government.</p>
                <p>A general system of public surveys has not yet been extended to Alaska and all
                    entries thus far made in that district are upon special surveys. The act of
                    Congress extending to Alaska the mining laws of the United States contained the
                    reservation that it should not be construed to put in force the general land
                    laws of the country. By act approved March 3, 1891, authority was given for
                    entry of lands for town-site purposes and also for the purchase of not exceeding
                    one hundred and sixty acres then or thereafter occupied for purposes of trade
                    and manufacture. The purpose of Congress as thus far expressed has been that
                    only such rights should apply to that Territory as should be specifically
                    named.</p>
                <p>It will be seen how much remains to be done for that vast and remote and yet
                    promising portion of our country. Special authority <pb n="XXVIII" xml:id="pg_XXVIII" facs="0028"/>was given to the President by the Act of
                    Congress approved July 24, 1897, to divide that Territory into two land
                    districts and to designate the boundaries thereof and to appoint registers and
                    receivers of said land offices, and the President was also authorized to appoint
                    a surveyor-general for the entire district. Pursuant to this authority, a
                    surveyor-general and receiver have been appointed, with offices at Sitka. If in
                    the ensuing year the conditions justify it, the additional land district
                    authorized by law will be established, with an office at some point in the Yukon
                    Valley. No appropriation, however, was made for this purpose, and that is now
                    necessary to be done for the two land districts into which the Territory is to
                    be divided.</p>
                <p>I concur with the Secretary of War in his suggestions as to the necessity for a
                    military force in the Territory of Alaska for the protection of persons and
                    property. Already a small force, consisting of twenty-five men, with two
                    officers, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Randall, of the Eighth Infantry,
                    has been sent to St. Michael to establish a military post.</p>
                <p>As it is to the interest of the Government to encourage the development and
                    settlement of the country and its duty to follow up its citizens there with the
                    benefits of legal machinery, I earnestly urge upon Congress the establishment of
                    a system of government with such flexibility as will enable it to adjust itself
                    to the future areas of greatest population.</p>
                <p>The startling though possibly exaggerated reports from the Yukon River country,
                    of the probable shortage of food for the large number of people who are
                    wintering there without the means of leaving the country are confirmed in such
                    measure as to justify bringing the matter to the attention of Congress. Access
                    to that country in winter can be had only by the passes from Dyea and vicinity,
                    which is a most difficult and perhaps an impossible task. However, should these
                    reports of the suffering of our fellow-citizens be further verified, every
                    effort at any cost should be made to carry them relief.</p>
                <p>For a number of years past it has been apparent that the conditions under which
                    the Five Civilized Tribes were established in the Indian Territory under treaty
                    provisions with the United States, with the right of self-government and the
                    exclusion of all white persons from within their borders, have undergone so
                    complete a change as to render the continuance of the system thus inaugurated
                    practically impossible. The total number of the Five Civilized Tribes, as shown
                    by the last census, is 45,494, and this number has not materially increased;
                    while the white population is estimated at <pb n="XXIX" xml:id="pg_XXIX" facs="0029"/>from 200,000 0 250,000 which by permission of the Indian
                    Government has settled in the Territory. The present area of the Indian
                    Territory contains 25,694,564 acres, much of which is very fertile land. The
                    United States citizens residing in the Territory, most of whom have gone there
                    by invitation or with the consent of the tribal authorities, have made permanent
                    homes for themselves. Numerous towns have been built in which from 500 to 5,000
                    white people now reside. Valuable residences and business houses have been
                    erected in many of them. Large business enterprises are carried on in which vast
                    sums of money are employed, and yet these people, who have invested their
                    capital in the development of the productive resources of the country, are
                    without title to the land they occupy and have no voice whatever in the
                    government either of the Nations or Tribes. Thousands of their children who were
                    born in the Territory are of school age, but the doors of the schools of the
                    Nations are shut against them and what education they get is by private
                    contribution. No provision for the protection of the life or property of these
                    white citizens is made by the Tribal Governments and Courts.</p>
                <p>The Secretary of the Interior reports that leading Indians have absorbed great
                    tracts of land to the exclusion of the common people, and government by an
                    Indian aristocracy has been practically established, to the detriment of the
                    people. It has been found impossible for the United States to keep its citizens
                    out of the Territory and the executory conditions contained in the treaties with
                    these Nations have for the most part become impossible of execution. Nor has it
                    been possible for the Tribal Governments to secure to each individual Indian his
                    full enjoyment in common with other Indians of the common property of the
                    Nations. Friends of the Indians have long believed that the best interests of
                    the Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes would be found in American citizenship,
                    with all the rights and privileges which belong to that condition.</p>
                <p>By Section 16 of the Act of March 3, 1893, the President was authorized to
                    appoint three commissioners to enter into negotiations with the Cherokee,
                    Choctaw, Chickasaw, Muscogee (or Creek) and Seminole Nations, commonly known as
                    the Five Civilized Tribes in the Indian Territory. Briefly, the purposes of the
                    negotiations were to be: The extinguishment of Tribal titles to any lands within
                    that Territory now held by any and all such Nations or Tribes, either by cession
                    of the same or some part thereof to the United States, or by allotment and
                    division of the same in severalty among the Indians of such Nations or Tribes
                    respectively as may be entitled to the same, or by such other method as may be
                    agreed upon <pb n="XXX" xml:id="pg_XXX" facs="0030"/>between the several Nations
                    and Tribes aforesaid, or each of them with the United States, with a view to
                    such an adjustment upon the basis of justice and equity as may, with the consent
                    of the said Nations of Indians so far as may be necessary, be requisite and
                    suitable to enable the ultimate creation of a State or States of the Union which
                    shall embrace the lands within said Indian Territory.</p>
                <p>The Commission met much opposition from the beginning. The Indians were very slow
                    to act and those in control manifested a decided disinclination to meet with
                    favor the propositions submitted to them. A little more than three years after
                    this organization the Commission effected an agreement with the Choctaw Nation
                    alone. The Chickasaws, however, refused to agree to its terms, and as they have
                    a common interest with the Choctaws in the lands of said Nations, the agreement
                    with the latter Nation could have no effect without the consent of the former.
                    On April 23, 1897, the Commission effected an agreement with both tribes—the
                    Choctaws and Chickasaws. This agreement, it is understood, has been ratified by
                    the constituted authorities of the respective Tribes or Nations parties thereto,
                    and only requires ratification by Congress to make it binding.</p>
                <p>On the 27th of September, 1897, an agreement was effected with the Creek Nation,
                    but it is understood that the National Council of said Nation has refused to
                    ratify the same. Negotiations are yet to be had with the Cherokees, the most
                    populous of the Five Civilized Tribes, and with the Seminoles, the smallest in
                    point of numbers and territory.</p>
                <p>The provision in the Indian Appropriation Act, approved June 10, 1896, makes it
                    the duty of the Commission to investigate and determine the rights of applicants
                    for citizenship in the Five Civilized Tribes, and to make complete census rolls
                    of the citizens of said Tribes. The Commission is at present engaged in this
                    work among the Creeks and has made appointments for taking the census of these
                    people up to and including the 30th of the present month.</p>
                <p>Should the agreement between the Choctaws and Chickasaws be ratified by Congress
                    and should the other Tribes’ fail to make an agreement with the Commission, then
                    it will be necessary that some legislation shall be had by Congress, which,
                    while just and honorable to the Indians, shall be equitable to the white people
                    who have settled upon these lands by invitation of the Tribal Nations.</p>
                <p>Hon. Henry L. Dawes, Chairman of the Commission, in a letter to the Secretary of
                    the Interior, under date of October 11, 1897, says: “Individual ownership is in
                    their (the Commission’s) opinion absolutely essential to any permanent
                    improvement in present conditions, <pb n="XXXI" xml:id="pg_XXXI" facs="0031"/>and the lack of it is the root of nearly all the evils which so grievously
                    afflict these people. Allotment by agreement is the only possible method, unless
                    the United States Courts are clothed with the authority to apportion the lands
                    among the citizen Indians for whose use it was originally granted.”</p>
                <p>I concur with the Secretary of the Interior that there can be no cure for the
                    evils engendered by the perversion of these great trusts excepting by their
                    resumption by the government which created them.</p>
                <p>The recent prevalence of yellow fever in a number of cities and towns throughout
                    the South has resulted in much disturbance of commerce and demonstrated the
                    necessity of such amendments to our quarantine laws as will make the regulations
                    of the national quarantine authorities paramount. The Secretary of the Treasury
                    in the portion of his report relating to the operation of the Marine Hospital
                    Service calls attention to the defects in the present quarantine laws and
                    recommends amendments thereto which will give the Treasury Department the
                    requisite authority to prevent the invasion of epidemic diseases from foreign
                    countries, and in times of emergency like that of the past summer will add to
                    the efficiency of the sanitary measures for the protection of the people and at
                    the same time prevent unnecessary restriction of commerce. I concur in his
                    recommendation.</p>
                <p>In further effort to prevent the invasion of the United States by yellow fever
                    the importance of the discovery of the exact cause of the disease, which up to
                    the present time has been undetermined, is obvious, and to this end a systematic
                    bacteriological investigation should be made. I therefore recommend that
                    Congress authorize the appointment of a commission by the President, to consist
                    of four expert bacteriologists, one to be selected from the medical officers of
                    the Marine Hospital Service, one to be appointed from civil life, one to be
                    detailed from the medical officers of the Army and one from the medical officers
                    of the Navy.</p>
                <p>The Union Pacific Railway, Main Line, was sold under the decree of the United
                    States Court for the District of Nebraska on the 1st and 2d of November of this
                    year. The amount due the Government consisted of the principal of the subsidy
                    bonds, $27,236,512, and the accrued interest thereon, $31,211,711.75, making the
                    total indebtedness, $58,448,223.75. The bid at the sale covered the first
                    mortgage lien and the entire mortgage claim of the Government, principal and
                    interest.</p>
                <pb n="XXXII" xml:id="pg_XXXII" facs="0032"/>
                <p>The sale of the subsidized portion of the Kansas Pacific Line, upon which the
                    Government holds a second mortgage lien, has been postponed at the instance of
                    the Government to December 6, 1897. The debt of this division of the Union
                    Pacific Railway to the Government on November 1, 1897, was the principal of the
                    subsidy bonds, $6,303,000, and the unpaid and accrued interest thereon,
                    $6,626,690.33, making a total of $12,929,690.33.</p>
                <p>The sale of this road was originally advertised for November 4th, but for the
                    purpose of securing the utmost public notice of the event it was postponed until
                    December 16th and a second advertisement of the sale was made. By the decree of
                    the Court the upset price on the sale of the Kansas Pacific will yield to the
                    Government the sum of $2,500,000 over all prior liens, costs and charges. If no
                    other or better bid is made this sum is all that the Government will receive on
                    its claim of nearly $13,000,000. The Government has no information as to whether
                    there will be other bidders or a better bid than the minimum amount herein
                    stated. The question presented therefore is: Whether the Government shall under
                    the authority given it by the Act of March 3, 1887, purchase or redeem the road
                    in the event that a bid is not made by private parties covering the entire
                    Government claim. To qualify the Government to bid at the sales will require a
                    deposit of $900,000, as follows: In the Government cause $500,000 and in each of
                    the first mortgage causes $200,000, and in the latter the deposit must be in
                    cash. Payments at the sale are as follows: Upon the acceptance of the bid a sum
                    which with the amount already deposited shall equal fifteen per cent, of the
                    bid; the balance in installments of twenty-five per cent, thirty, forty and
                    fifty days after the confirmation of the sale. The lien on the Kansas Pacific
                    prior to that of the Government on the 30th July, 1897, principal and interest,
                    amounted to $7,281,048.11. The Government, therefore, should it become the
                    highest bidder, will have to pay the amount of the first mortgage lien.</p>
                <p>I believe that under the act of 1887 it has the authority to do this and in
                    absence of any action by Congress I shall direct the Secretary of the Treasury
                    to make the necessary deposit as required by the Court’s decree to qualify as a
                    bidder and to bid at the sale a sum which will at least equal the principal of
                    the debt due to the Government; but suggest in order to remove all controversy
                    that an amendment of the law be immediately passed explicitly giving such powers
                    and appropriating in general terms whatever sum is sufficient therefor.</p>
                <p>In so important a matter as the Government becoming the possible <pb n="XXXIII" xml:id="pg_XXXIII" facs="0033"/>owner of railroad property which it perforce
                    must conduct and operate, I feel constrained to lay before Congress these facts
                    for its consideration and action before the consummation of the sale. It is
                    clear to my mind that the Government should not permit the property to be sold
                    at a price which will yield less than one-half of the principal of its debt and
                    less than one-fifth of its entire debt, principal and interest. But whether the
                    Government, rather than accept less than its claim, should become a bidder and
                    thereby the owner of the property, I submit to the Congress for action.</p>
                <p>The Library building provided for by the act of Congress approved April 15, 1886,
                    has been completed and opened to the public. It should be a matter of
                    congratulation that through the foresight and munificence of Congress the nation
                    possesses this noble treasure-house of knowledge. It is earnestly to be hoped
                    that having done so much towards the cause of education, Congress will continue
                    to develop the Library in every phase of research to the end that it may be not
                    only one of the most magnificent but among the richest and most useful libraries
                    in the world.</p>
                <p>The important branch of our Government known as the Civil Service, the practical
                    improvement of which has long been a subject of earnest discussion, has of late
                    years received increased legislative and Executive approval. During the past few
                    months the service has been placed upon a still firmer basis of business methods
                    and personal merit. While the right of our veteran soldiers to reinstatement in
                    deserving cases has been asserted, dismissals for merely political reasons have
                    been carefully guarded against, the examinations for admittance to the service
                    enlarged and at the same time rendered less technical and more practical; and a
                    distinct advance has been made by giving a hearing before dismissal upon all
                    cases where incompetency is charged or demand made for the removal of officials
                    in any of the Departments. This order has been made to give to the accused his
                    right to be heard but without in any way impairing the power of removal, which
                    should always be exercised in cases of inefficiency and incompetency, and which
                    is one of the vital safeguards of the civil service reform system, preventing
                    stagnation and deadwood and keeping every employee keenly alive to the fact that
                    the security of his tenure depends not on favor but on his own tested and
                    carefully watched record of service.</p>
                <p>Much of course still remains to be accomplished before the system can be made
                    reasonably perfect for our needs. There are <pb n="XXXIV" xml:id="pg_XXXIV" facs="0034"/>places now in the classified service which ought to be exempted
                    and others not classified may properly be included. I shall not hesitate to
                    exempt cases which I think have been improperly included in the classified
                    service or include those which in my judgment will best promote the public
                    service. The system has the approval of the people and it will be my endeavor to
                    uphold and extend it.</p>
                <p>I am forced by the length of this Message to omit many important references to
                    affairs of the Government with which Congress will have to deal at the present
                    session. They are fully discussed in the departmental reports, to all of which I
                    invite your earnest attention.</p>
                <p>The estimates of the expenses of the Government by the several Departments will,
                    I am sure, have your careful scrutiny. While the Congress may not find it an
                    easy task to reduce the expenses of the Government, it should not encourage
                    their increase. These expenses will in my judgment admit of a decrease in many
                    branches of the Government without injury to the public service. It is a
                    commanding duty to keep the appropriations within the receipts of the
                    Government, and thus avoid a deficit.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your No. 187, of December 31, 1896, with which you inclose a
                            copy of a letter addressed to the Department by Mr. E. F. Skinner,
                            representing the Gulf Coast Lumber Company, in which letter Mr. Skinner
                            states that he is informed that a discriminating tariff exists here
                            against American lumber and in favor of Canadian.</p>
                        <p>Assuming that the members of the Gulf Coast Lumber Association export
                            yellow pine to this market, I am at a loss to understand the inquiry
                            made by Mr. Skinner, inasmuch as the discriminating duty of which he
                            speaks ceased January 1, 1895.</p>
                        <p>The discrimination against yellow pine had existed here for several years
                            prior to my arrival in 1894. During that year I devoted my attention
                            toward getting the rate on this class of lumber adjusted in some manner
                            more nearly equitable than the rate then existing.</p>
                        <p>So that the Department’s correspondent may understand the conditions that
                            existed at that time, the difficulties met with in the effort to get the
                            rates changed, and the result obtained, I beg to call your attention to
                            the inclosures accompanying my No. 49, of August 13, 1894, and <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0036"/>especially to Exhibit C of the “table of
                            comparative statistics” therewith (see <ref target="frus1894#pg_7">Foreign Relations, 1894, pp. 7</ref>–<ref target="frus1894#pg_12">12</ref>); to my No. 63 of October 5, 1894 (see <ref target="frus1894#pg_14">Foreign Relations, 1894, pp. 14</ref>–<ref target="frus1894#pg_17">17</ref>); and to my No. 74 of November 19,
                            1894, and my cablegram of January 10, 1895 (see <ref target="frus1895p1#pg_3">Foreign Relations, 1895, pp. 3</ref>, <ref target="frus1895p1#pg_4">4</ref>).</p>
                        <p>From the above correspondence it will be seen that under the Argentine
                            tariff law of 1895 white-pine lumber paid $4.88 per 1,000 feet; spruce
                            pine, $3.48 per 1,000 feet, and yellow pine, $4.18 per 1,000 feet.</p>
                        <p>No change in these rates was made in the tariff for 1896 and none has
                            been made in the tariff law for 1897.</p>
                        <p>The benefits secured to our yellow-pine producers by the success of the
                            legation’s efforts in 1894 to secure an adjustment of values and tariffs
                            as they had for some years applied to white, spruce, and yellow pine may
                            be seen from the following comparative table showing the rates of duty
                            and valuation of the three classes of lumber for 1894 and 1895: <table rows="8" cols="6">

                        <p>The result of the change thus made in the pine-lumber schedule is seen in
                            the very large increase shown in the importation of yellow pine into
                            this country since 1895. According to the Lamport and Holt Steamship
                            Company’s shipping list this increase amounted to nearly 20,000,000 feet
                            during 1895.</p>
                        <p>As I advised you in my No. 186 of January 10, 1896, the duty on oak was
                            reduced 10 per cent in the tariff for 1896. It remains the same under
                            the tariff law for 1897.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your No. 186, of December 30, 1896, with which you inclose
                            copy of the correspondence had with Mr. George 0. Gorham, representing
                            the American Cotton Oil Company, with regard to the customs duty on
                            cotton oil in this Republic.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gorham states that “the Government of the Argentine Republic has
                            largely increased the duty on cotton oil, an American product. The duty
                            has hitherto been the same as that on olive oil, but is now to be
                            increased 20 per cent.”</p>
                        <p>I assume that what Mr. Gorham thus refers to is the fact that such a move
                            was before the last Congress, during which it was discussed at some
                            length and on several occasions. I was familiar and kept in touch with
                            the arguments being made in support of the proposition advanced to
                            increase the duty 2 cents per kilo, and took every opportunity in
                            conversation with members to answer the criticisms and arguments being
                            made. I was at one time inclined to believe the proposition would be
                            carried, but am glad to say that it was not, and that the duty on cotton
                            oil is the same for 1897 that it was for 1895 and 1896, viz, 10 cents
                            specific duty per kilo, the same as olive and other “comestible”
                            oils.</p>
                        <p>The reason urged in Congress in favor of raising the duty was that cotton
                            oil entered into competition with a home product, “aceite de mani”
                            (peanut oil). The manufacturers of the latter oil clamored to be
                            protected against the American oil, which they claimed would ruin their
                            industry. I explained to members that such a thing was illogical,
                            inasmuch as the price of cotton-seed oil in New York at that time was
                            higher than the price of peanut oil here, so that the home product
                            needed nothing in the line of legislation to protect it.</p>
                        <p>That you may understand what the peanut oil industry amounts to here, as
                            it will always be put forward as a reason why the duty on cotton oil
                            shall not be reduced—a thing I wish very much to see done—I may say that
                            the industry is principally confined to the provinces of Corrientes and
                            Santa Fe. There are about 8,000 acres in peanut cultivation in the
                            Republic. The production is about 2,500 pounds per acre. The yield in
                            oil is about 22 per cent. Two-thirds of this is first quality. The total
                            yield of oil in the Republic would be, therefore, more or less, three
                            and a quarter million pounds. There are 13 peanut-oil factories, large
                            and small, in the Republic. Eight of these are in the city.</p>
                        <p>In Argentine statistics cotton oil is not separated from table oils. All
                            “aceites comestibles” are classified as “olive oil.” It thus happens
                            that in the Argentine statistics for the year 1895, 291,100 kilos of
                            “olive oil” are alleged to have been imported here from the United
                            States. This, of course, was cotton oil. The figures do not, however,
                            agree with those of the United States Statistical (Bureau?), which gives
                            a higher figure.</p>
                        <p>There is a possibility that the high duty kept on this oil here results
                            in a considerable quantity finding its way through the custom-house as
                            lubricating oil, which pays a very much lower rate of duty.</p>
                        <p>I believe an effort should be made to secure a further reduction in the
                            duty on cotton oil strictly on the merits of the case, without reference
                            to the question of olive or any other vegetable oil, with the exception
                            of palm oil, which pays 0.04 specific per kilo and might be used as a
                            leverage to secure a reduction on cotton oil. A reference to the closing
                                <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0038"/>portion of the inclosure which
                            accompanied my No. 49<note n="1" xml:id="d4fn1">See <ref target="frus1894#pg_7">Foreign Relations; 1894, p.
                                7</ref>.</note> of August 13, 1894, and to Exhibit C of the table of
                            comparative statistics to which I therein referred, which shows that the
                            subject has had my attention more than once. At that time I secured a
                            reduction from 12 cents per kilo to 10 cents. It may be well to state
                            that to secure another reduction it will require a well directed effort
                            to dislodge the prejudice which exists here against the oil.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to make the average person here believe that the oil here
                            is digestible or that it can be and is used as an adulterant of table
                            oils.</p>
                        <p>Possibly under the circumstances this should not be done. It may be best
                            to treat it as a fine lubricant or crude oil similar to palm oil. The
                            American Cotton Oil Company can best decide that. I believe a large
                            trade can be built up here by them if they will give the subject their
                            careful attention. Especially do I believe this since on the next to the
                            last day of the last Congress linseed oil was put on the tax list at 12
                            cents specific duty per kilo, a rise of more than 250 per cent in the
                            rate. But this was done to protect the factories now existing in the
                            Republic. While that action will affect our trade somewhat, it will not
                            be so serious for us as for Great Britain, the shipments of this oil to
                            this country during 1895 having amounted to but 2,829 kilos from the
                            United States, as against 268,037 kilos from Great Britain and 5,692
                            from Germany. Possibly this rise in the rate of linseed oil may be the
                            means of increasing the consumption of cotton oil if the opportunity is
                            made use of.</p>
                        <p>I am ready to second any efforts that will aid in widening the market for
                            our product, and have already planned a campaign before the next
                            Congress in favor of cotton oil and several other products which we
                            produce to a greater extent than other countries.</p>
                        <p>I trust the above may throw some light on the subject of your dispatch,
                            and have the honor, etc.,</p>

                            Austria, the authorities of that country took possession of his passport
                            and refused to return it to him, notwithstanding his frequent requests

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the dispatch No. 274,
                            addressed under date of the 16th of December, 1896, by the Hon. Richard
                            Olney, Secretary of State, to my predecessor, the Hon. Bartlett Tripp,
                            upon the subject of a complaint made at the State Department by Mr.
                            Leopold Rieder, of Newark, N. J., in regard to the seizure of his
                            passport by the local authorities during a visit which he made to
                            Galicia, his native country, in the summer of 1896, I have the honor to
                            inclose to you herewith copies of the correspondence which has taken
                            place between the minister of the United States and the Imperial and
                            Royal ministry of foreign affairs.</p>
                        <p>Upon receipt of the dispatch from the Secretary of State, Mr. Tripp
                            addressed a note to Count Goluchowsky, Imperial and Royal minister of
                            foreign affairs, dated the 29th day of December, 1896, a copy of which
                            is inclosed herewith, calling his attention to the complaint of Mr.
                            Rieder, and requesting him to cause investigation to be made as to the
                            facts of the case, and if no sufficient cause were found for the
                            detention of the passport in question, to have such instructions given
                            to the local officials of Galicia as should prevent the recurrence of
                            such conduct in the future.</p>
                        <p>I have received from the Imperial and Royal foreign office a reply to
                            this communication, dated the 22d of June, 1897, a translation of which
                            is also inclosed herewith.</p>
                        <p>It appears therefrom that the attention of the local authorities was
                            attracted to Mr. Rieder during his stay in Galicia, as they would
                            naturally <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0040"/>be to a returned
                            emigrant, and that by reason of a request made at that time by his
                            sister for a permit to go to America he was suspected of carrying on an
                            illicit emigration agency. It is more than likely that the police sought
                            also to test his liability to perform military service. He was summoned
                            to appear before the magistrate and give an account of himself. To this
                            summons he paid no attention, however, but gave up his American
                            passport, saying that that would explain the situation. Thereupon an
                            official inquiry was begun, which was delayed by the transfer of the
                            proceedings from the court of origin to another, established in the
                            meantime, which had jurisdiction of the case. The decision having been
                            reached by the magistrate, after due examination, that no cause of
                            action lay against Mr. Rieder, his passport was ordered to be given back
                            to him. But before that time Mr. Rieder had left Galicia upon his return
                            to America, and could not be found. The passport, which is numbered
                            12722, and was issued to Leopold Rieder by the Hon. Richard Olney on the
                            3d day of June, 1896, has been returned to this legation, and is now
                            inclosed to you herewith. It seems probable that if Mr. Rieder had
                            consented to appear and make a statement to the magistrate when he was
                            summoned he would have saved himself much annoyance, and would have had
                            his passport given back to him without delay.</p>

                                that in the month of August, 1896, he visited Galicia, his native
                                country, for a temporary stay, and that on the next day after his
                                arrival at the city of Rzeszow, in Galicia, he was visited by the
                                mayor of the city, or his clerk, and asked for his passport; that
                                the same was thereupon taken from him and has not been since
                                returned to him; that after remaining at his former home for six

                            <p>In reply to the esteemed note of December 29, 1896, numbered 166,
                                relating to the complaint made by Leopold Rieder against the
                                confiscation by the Imperial and Royal authorities of his passport,
                                the ministry <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0041"/>of foreign affairs
                                begs to inform the United States’ legation of the results of the
                                investigation made in the premises.</p>
                            <p>Upon a request made by Machle Rieder, of Lutzka, the sister of the
                                plaintiff, Leopold Rieder, for a passport to go to America,
                                suspicion was aroused that Leopold Rieder, who was then in Lutzka,
                                was carrying on an illegal emigration agency. The district captain
                                at Rzeszow therefore directed the chief of community at Lutzka,
                                Johann Norvakowsky, to investigate this matter thoroughly. The
                                latter, after having conferred with some of the older inhabitants of
                                the place, reported that Rieder had left Rzeszow when he was a
                                child, emigrated to America, is not inscribed on any of the record
                                books of the place, has not rendered any military service, and that
                                his age can not be stated accurately. Thereupon the chief of
                                community summoned Mr. Rieder to appear before the district captain
                                at Rzeszow. Rieder, however, did not appear in compliance with this
                                summons, but handed his passport voluntarily to the judge, with the
                                remark that the district captain at Rzeszow would be able with this
                                document to bring the matter to a termination.</p>
                            <p>On the strength of this remark the chief of community at Lutzka
                                transferred the case, with the documents of Rieder, to the district
                                captain in Rzeszow on the 21st day of October, 1896, and they were
                                afterwards sent to Stryzow, where, in the meantime, a district
                                captaincy had been established.</p>
                            <p>There being no cause for further action in the matter—and since the
                                provisions of the treaty of September 20, 1870, between the United
                                States and Austria-Hungary, exempted Rieder from punishment—the
                                district captain at Stryzow, under date of January 15, 1897, ordered
                                that the passport should be given back to Mr. Rieder, which order,
                                however, could not be carried out, because Rieder had left for
                                America in the fall of 1896, without having asked for the return of
                                his passport.</p>
                            <p>The passport in question is herewith respectfully placed at the
                                disposal of the legation of the United States.</p>

                            decided by a justice of the peace of said county, the plaintiff in whose
                            favor judgment has been rendered has made application to a Croatian
                            court, to the end that certain real estate belonging to the defendant,
                            and lying within the jurisdiction of the said Croatian court, may be

                            foreigndecisions (among them those of Croatian courts), and, if so,

                            last 10 kilos of pork of American origin were declared in the
                            slaughterhouse at Teplitz, Bohemia, to contain trichinae. The
                            investigation showed that the pork in question was covered by a
                            certificate issued in Chicago, April 3, 1896, sub Z, 44, apparently on
                            the ground of a microscopical examination concerning the unquestioned
                            healthy condition of the meat.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the importation of hog products from the United
                            States into Austria is by no means inconsiderable, and that the
                            certificates from the original place of shipment must absolutely provide
                            a guaranty of safety, which was made a condition in 1891 for the repeal
                            of the prohibition of the importation of pork coming from the United <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0043"/>States (Reichsgesetz Blatt, No.

                            the Federal Government, to the end that it may take such measures as to

                            shipped from Chicago April 3, 1896, under certificate No. 44, and was
                            consigned to Hamburg, Germany; that the meat had received a careful and
                            thorough microscopical inspection, and was found free from trichinae
                            before it was packed; that there appears to be no evidence that the meat
                            shipped from Hamburg to Bohemia under this certificate was the same meat
                            that was shipped from Chicago to Hamburg; that there is an apparent

                            shipments of pork from the United States to Austria-Hungary that have

                            care, and every precaution is adopted to prevent any unwholesome meat

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary of State</hi>: In your obliging note
                            of July 31 last, No. 124, your excellency had the kindness to inform me
                            that the competent authorities of the State of New York did not hold
                            themselves bound to receive the American citizen, Amalie Roeber, in any
                            insane asylum in that State, inasmuch as it did not appear from the
                            documents submitted that she had been a resident of that State within
                            the last twenty years.</p>
                        <p>The Imperial and Royal mayoralty (statthalterei), whom I duly advised of
                            this statement, has of late again requested me to endeavor to secure her
                            reception in an asylum for the insane in this country. The above
                            authorities refer, in support of their request, to the fact that the
                            American citizenship of Amalie Roeber is proved beyond a doubt by the
                            inclosed documents (to be kindly returned), and that, therefore, the
                            right in principle of the demand can not be questioned.</p>
                        <p>I further invite your excellency’s attention to the additional
                            circumstance that at the time of receiving the aforesaid American
                            citizen, the Imperial and Royal Hospital in Vienna was solely guided by
                            views of humanity, and did not first endeavor to obtain certitude upon
                            minor circumstances which would have aided in insuring at that time her
                            reception in one or the other asylums of her country.</p>
                        <p>It appears to me no more than equitable, therefore, that the burden of
                            the support of Amalie Roeber, whose American citizenship can not be
                            questioned, should be borne by an asylum of her own country.</p>
                        <p>In view thereof I have the honor to request your excellency to cause
                            suitable action to be taken looking to her reception in an asylum here,
                            and at the same time to inform me as early as practicable of the manner
                            by which this will be effected.</p>
                        <p>In order to aid in determining the question what public institution <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0046"/>in this country the duty devolves
                            upon of caring for Amalie Roeber, I beg to submit the following
                            data:</p>
                        <p>The aforesaid was a child 9 years old when she removed to New York with
                            her aunt; according to the inclosed<note n="1" xml:id="d14fn1">Inclosures not printed.</note> marriage certificate she there
                            married at the age of 23 Emil Roeber, whose certificate of
                            naturalization is likewise inclosed, and she appears to have lived with
                            him partly in Boston and partly in New York until 1888.”</p>
                        <p>In looking forward to an obliging reply from your excellency in this
                            matter, I avail, etc.,</p>

                            citizen, who has been an inmate of the psychiatric department thereof
                            since November 6 last, under treatment for protracted insanity. The

                            that Boris Adler, who is able to undergo transportation, be received in

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note, with inclosures of November 16, last, relating to
                            Amalie or Amalia Roeber, at present an inmate of the psychiatric
                            department of the general hospital in Vienna, whose case has been the
                            subject of previous correspondence between your legation and the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>In your last note you renew the request of your Government that the
                            patient be returned to, and presumably at the expense of, the United
                            States.</p>
                        <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0047"/>
                        <p>The following are alleged to be the facts in the case:</p>
                        <p>That Amalie Roeber came to the United States with an aunt when she was 9
                            years of age; that on the 19th of September, 1867, she was married to
                            Emil Roeber; that on October 24, 1867, Emil Roeber was naturalized a
                            citizen of the United States before the court of common pleas of the
                            city of New York, and that a passport was issued to her by the United
                            States legation at Vienna, November 30, 1888.</p>
                        <p>By the enumeration of the above facts, supported by the inclosures in
                            your note, it is not shown in what State Amalie Roeber last resided
                            before her departure for Europe, nor exactly how long she has been
                            absent from the United States.</p>
                        <p>Waiving the question that might properly be raised as to her intent to
                            return to this country before she was attacked with dementia and had
                            become an inmate of the hospital in Vienna, and admitting that she
                            should be returned, it would necessarily have to be determined of what
                            State she was a resident before the authorities thereof would be
                            justified, if at all, in receiving her.</p>
                        <p>If this can not be definitely shown, it naturally follows that neither
                            the State of New York nor that of Massachusetts can be rightfully
                            expected to assume such a charge. There is no Federal law or
                            appropriation, moreover, under which an insane citizen of the United
                            States can be returned from Europe to this country. If, therefore, the
                            friends or relatives of the person in question can not be found, or will
                            not have her removed, the Department perceives no way in the present
                            status of the case by which a compliance with the request of your
                            Government can be effected.</p>
                        <p>Returning the inclosures to your note, I avail myself, etc.,</p>

                            Adler, a naturalized citizen of the United States, at present an inmate
                            of the psychiatric department of the General Hospital of Vienna, whose
                            authorities request that he be returned to the United States.</p>
                        <p>This case was promptly brought to the attention of the governor of

                            resident of Indianapolis, Ind., and that he has a brother residing in
                            that city who is poor.</p>
                        <p>It appears from the papers submitted in your note that the unfortunate

                            transportation and making it beyond the financial ability of his brother

                            appear, according to the letter of the governor of Indiana, that there
                            would be any objection on the part of the State authorities to receive
                            him and place him in an insane asylum.</p>
                        <p>As explained in previous correspondence on recent cases of like
                            character, such as those of Amalie Roeber and others, the Federal <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0048"/>Government is without authority
                            of law or appropriated funds to bring such persons back, even at the
                            instance of their relatives; but, on the other hand, it makes no demand
                            upon other governments to remove foreign lunatics who have been admitted
                            to State or district asylums, confining itself in exceptional cases to
                            giving information through the diplomatic channel, in order that the
                            relatives may have the opportunity to care for the individual. Your
                            inquiry appears to have been of this class, and is accordingly answered
                            by conveying to you the information received from the executive
                            department of Indiana.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary of State</hi>: Mr. Ira Robinson,
                            prosecuting attorney of Taylor County, W. Va., has informed me, by the
                            inclosed letter, that Josef Eisenmann, said to be an Austrian subject,
                            is now held in jail in Taylor County as a lunatic, and the aforesaid
                            prosecuting attorney has expressed a wish that this legation will take
                            the necessary steps to have him removed to a private hospital or
                            otherwise cared for.</p>
                        <p>I have informed Mr. Robinson, in reply, that this legation has no funds
                            at its disposal for the purpose mentioned by him, and that I would
                            transmit his letter to the State Department, inasmuch as it raises a
                            question of international law.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of any treaty stipulation on the subject, I do not
                            consider myself authorized to address a definite request to the Federal
                            Government in connection herewith. I think, however, that it is proper
                            for me to bring the matter to its notice, for the reason that the course
                            pursued, according to Mr. Robinson’s letter, in Eisenmann’s case, he
                            being confined in jail instead of being taken to an insane asylum, is
                            not in harmony either with the principles of humanity or with the course
                            pursued by us toward American citizens who have become insane in
                            Austria-Hungary.</p>
                        <p>The question of the removal to asylums in their own country of destitute
                            American citizens who are receiving care and treatment in Austrian
                            insane asylums has given rise to frequent correspondence between this
                            legation and the Department of State, in the course of which the Federal
                            Government has, it is true, declined to cause these unfortunate persons
                            to be removed to American asylums, but has nevertheless referred to the
                            fact that, when the case is reversed, i.e., when insane foreigners have
                            been admitted into American State or district asylums, it presents no
                            claim for indemnity to their Governments. I take the liberty, in this
                            connection, to call your attention to the case of Amalie Roeber and that
                            of Boris Adler, which were discussed last winter, and especially to your
                            predecessor’s note of January 13, 1897, No. 145.</p>
                        <p>Without proposing to deduce, from the assurance contained in the
                            concluding portion of the note above referred to, a claim for the actual
                            removal to an insane asylum of every Austrian subject who has become
                            insane in this country, or in any wise to discuss the legal questions
                            arising in reference hereto, I desire simply to present the matter in
                            its purely humanitarian aspect, pointing to the fact that in all such
                            cases American <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0049"/>citizens who have
                            become insane in Austria have been removed to our public asylums, where
                            they have been treated and cared for, and to the additional fact that
                            the application for compensation, or for the removal of the unfortunate
                            persons to their homes, has not been made until some time afterwards,
                            and then through the diplomatic channel.</p>
                        <p>I should be very grateful, Mr. Secretary of State, if you would have the
                            kindness to inform me of the steps taken in Eisenmann’s case.</p>

                                now held in jail here, the State Hospital for the Insane refusing to
                                take him for the reason that he is not a citizen of this State.</p>

                                him. The man is in such condition that he should have attention at

                                private hospital will restore him to his right mind in time.</p>
                            <p>You will please let me hear from you at once what the representative

                                impression made by a rubber stamp found among his papers. It seems
                                that he landed in this country in July last.</p>
                            <p>This county has no right to provide for this lunatic, and you will
                                therefore take steps in his behalf at once.</p>

                            November last, relative to the case of Albert Levy, an American citizen,
                            who is confined in an asylum in Austria as a person afflicted with
                            chronic insanity, I have the honor to inform you that the Department has
                            just received from the office of the executive branch of the government
                            of California a reply to a letter addressed to the governor of that
                            State by the Department on December 9 last, in reference.</p>
                        <p>It appears that the case was at once referred by the governor to the
                            police authorities of San Francisco, who have been unable to obtain any
                            information in regard to the matter except that Levy was thought to be
                            of unsound mind when he resided in California; that he had no <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0050"/>relatives in this country so far as can
                            be ascertained, and would appear to have been married to an Austrian
                            woman who did not accompany him to the United States.</p>
                        <p>A letter from the office of the governor says that the State of
                            California can take no action in the matter; that it cares for all
                            dependent afflicted persons within its borders, but has no law
                            authorizing its officials to send abroad for persons who would be a
                            proper charge upon the State if they resided within its

                            stating that the committee has under consideration a bill for the
                            adoption of the metric system of weights and measures for this country,
                            and inquiring for authoritative information upon the following points: <list>
                                <item>First. Whether or not any serious difficulty was encountered
                                    by Austria-Hungary in making the change from the customary
                                    weights and measures to those of the metric system, together
                                    with any information as to the manner in which such change was
                                    made and the time occupied in making it.</item>
                                <item>Second. How far said system is satisfactory in practical
                                    operation, and whether there is any disposition or desire to
                                    return to the former system.</item>
                                <item>Third. What effect, if any, has the adoption of the metric
                                    system had on the trade and commerce of Austria-Hungary in
                                    adopting it.</item>

                            weights and measures and the laws relating thereto, desired for the use
                            of the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the House of
                            Representatives, I have the honor to transmit answers to the above as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>The metric system of weights and measures was adopted by act of
                            Parliament in Austria-Hungary on July 23, 1871. This act, after
                            enumerating the tables of the metric system, contained a table of the
                            various weights and measures then in use in every part of the Monarchy,
                                <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0051"/>and with their equivalents in
                            the metric system and all changes from the old to the new system were
                            required by law to be made according to this table. A period of four
                            years and six months, or until January 1, 1876, was allowed for the
                            practical development of the new system, after which date the metric
                            system was made compulsory.</p>
                        <p>A translation of Articles V and VI of the act of 1871 is as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Article V.</hi></p>
                                <p>The weights and measures of the metric system, as enumerated in
                                    Article III, will be exclusively used in public traffic
                                    commencing January 1, 1876. After this period the use of weights
                                    and measures used heretofore and which are succeeded by the
                                    weights and measures just mentioned as well as the use of the
                                    carat weight and the weight for measuring oil will be
                                    prohibited.</p>
                                <p>For the measuring of land, however, the Government grants a
                                    prolongation of the time, and will hereafter make known the
                                    period when the new measure will be applied to land.</p>
                                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Article VI.</hi></p>
                                <p>Anyone illegally using any other system of weights and measures
                                    than the metric in public traffic will be fined one hundred
                                    florins, together with confiscation of these weights and
                                    measures. A repetition of the act will be regarded as an
                                    aggravating circumstance when passing sentence. The fine will be
                                    paid into the poor fund of the community where the act was
                                    committed. In case of inability to pay the fine imprisonment
                                    will be substituted, reckoning one day’s imprisonment for each
                                    five florins fined.</p>

                        <p>The leading wholesale and retail merchants of Vienna inform me that there
                            was a certain amount of confusion experienced in making the change from
                            the old to the new system at first, which was probably greatly due to
                            the natural prejudice against any changes in existing customs, but
                            merchants soon realized that the metric system, already in use in the
                            principal commercial countries of Europe with which Austria-Hungary had
                            the bulk of her commercial relations, proved to facilitate the
                            mercantile operations between Austria-Hungary and those countries.</p>
                        <p>On March 31, 1875, or nine months before the new system was made
                            compulsory, Parliament found it necessary to pass a law fixing the value
                            of fractions of a kreuzer in making the transfer from the old to the new
                            systems, according to the table of relative values between the old and
                            the new systems, as published in the original act of July 23, 1871. A
                            translation of the above act of 1875 is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Law of March 31, 1875, relating

                                        metric system.</hi></p>

                                <p>The Government is authorized, when carrying out the new law of
                                    the metric system, to make such adjustment in the conversion
                                    from old to new measure which the nature of the circumstances
                                    and the requirements of traffic seem to render necessary.</p>

                                <p>The Government is, moreover, authorized to change the weight and
                                    measure unit which has heretofore served in the assessment of
                                    taxes to a corresponding unit in the new system, and to fix the
                                    rates of payment according to the unit in the new system. On
                                    this adjustment of the amounts assessed fractions above one-half
                                    kreutzer will be considered one kreutzer, fractions less than
                                    half a kreutzer will be considered as half a kreutzer.</p>

                        <p>The universal opinion of the numerous wholesale and retail merchants whom
                            I have interviewed on the subject of the metric system in
                            Austria-Hungary is strongly in favor of the system, and they all agree
                            that there seems to be no desire to return to the old system. The trade
                            and commerce of Austria-Hungary increased steadily after the adoption of
                                <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0052"/>the metric system; between
                            1870 and 1880 the exports increased from 395,000,000 florins to
                            676,000,000 florins. The national economists with whom I have spoken on
                            the subject agree that this increase was only in a small measure due to
                            the adoption of the metric system, but statistics show that the trade of
                            Austria-Hungary with countries using the metric system materially
                            increased after its adoption by this country.</p>

                                the United States at Trieste, calls the attention of this legation
                                to the case of Karl Sitar, in which the facts as stated by him are
                                as follows:</p>
                            <p>Mr. Sitar is a native of Austria-Hungary, was born in 1873, and
                                emigrated to the United States when 17 years of age, and where,
                                after a continuous residence of five years, he was naturalized and
                                became a citizen of the United States. On the 20th of December,
                                1896, he returned to Austria for a brief visit to his mother, having
                                with him his certificate of naturalization and a passport from the
                                State Department at Washington in due form. Upon his arrival to
                                Toplitz, Unter-Krain, he was arrested and examined, and being found
                                unfit for military duty was held for violation of the military law
                                of Austria-Hungary and proceedings are now pending against him. He
                                was ordered to Laibach, as I am informed, for military examination,
                                but criminal proceedings, as it appears, are pending against him at
                                Rudolfswerth, in Krain.</p>
                            <p>If these facts are as reported by the consul at Trieste, the case
                                comes so clearly within the terms of the treaty of 1870 and the
                                cases Ladislav, Sedivy, and others decided under the treaty that I
                                trust your excellency will cause immediate suspension of the
                                proceedings against Mr. Sitar and require the local officers of that
                                province in future in similar cases to respect the rights of
                                citizens bearing American passports.</p>

                                in consequence of Sitar’s voluntarily reporting himself to the
                                district captain at Rudolfswerth as one liable to military duty, and
                                in total ignorance of the fact that he had acquired foreign
                                citizenship.</p>
                            <p>On his subsequent examination he was found physically too weak and

                            <p>The proceedings undertaken against him for violation of paragraph 48
                                of the military law were immediately discontinued as soon as the

                            of correspondence of this legation with the imperial and royal ministry
                            of foreign affairs of Austria-Hungary in the case of Mae or Mendel
                            Tewel.</p>
                        <p>It seems from the note of the ministry of foreign affairs that Mr.
                            Tewel’s arrest was caused by reason of the erroneous name given in the
                            certificate of naturalization and passport, in which he was described as
                            Mae Tewel instead of Mendel Tewel, his true name, and that he was
                            discharged upon proof that he was in fact the person to whom the papers
                            were issued.</p>
                        <p>I have no information as to how the error occurred, but am led to presume
                            that the clerk who made the entry of the judgment of naturalization in
                            his case may, as has in so many other cases occurred, have incorrectly
                            understood and written the foreign name in his records, and the victim
                            of such mistake has for reasons of supposed safety subsequently adopted
                            it as his true name.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: Complaint has been made to
                                this legation by Mae Tewel, a naturalized citizen of the United
                                States, that he has been arrested and held to answer for violation
                                of the military laws of Austria-Hungary, before the district court
                                at Tarnow, Galicia.</p>
                            <p>The facts, so far as they have been communicated to this legation,
                                are stated as follows:</p>
                            <p>Mae Tewel, a native of Brosteck, Galicia, emigrated to the United
                                States in 1885, where he continuously resided until December, 1896.
                                On the 7th of September, 1896, he was naturalized a citizen of the
                                United States at Fork, in the State of Pennsylvania, and a
                                certificate of naturalization was duly issued to him. In December,
                                1896, desiring to visit his relatives who reside in Galicia, he
                                applied to the Department of State at Washington for a passport,
                                which was duly issued to him, bearing date December 21, 1896, and
                                numbered 18735. On or about the 14th of January, 1897, Mae Tewel,
                                accompanied by his wife and two children, arrived in Krakau, having
                                with him his certificate of naturalization and passport.</p>
                            <p>On the 25th of January, 1897, Mae Tewel was arrested by the police at
                                Krakau, charged with violation of the military laws of
                                Austria-Hungary, in having failed to perform his military duty, and
                                was turned over to the provincial court at Tarnow, where he is still
                                held in custody. Upon his arrest he exhibited his certificate of
                                naturalization and passport and claimed exemption from arrest and
                                immunity from punishment under the treaty existing between the
                                United States and Austria-Hungary. The authorities, however,
                                declined to release him, but took away from him his passport and
                                certificate of naturalization, and have since declined to return the
                                same.</p>
                            <p>I shall be glad if your excellency will cause this matter to receive
                                immediate attention, and to be given to this legation, at the
                                earliest possible moment, the grounds of the arrest and detention of
                                Mae Tewel, of which at this time his family are wholly
                                uninformed.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The ministry of foreign affairs has
                                not omitted to act in compliance with the desire expressed in the
                                esteemed note of January 28, No. 171, and has made investigations

                                paragraph 45 of the military law of April 11, 1889, No. 41.</p>
                            <p>The person arrested was in possession of a passport and a certificate

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report to you for your
                            information the case of Paul Schwabek, a naturalized citizen of the
                            United States, recently arrested in Hungary for nonperformance of
                            military duty and released from the army by the intervention of this
                            legation.</p>
                        <p>The said Paul Schwabek was born in Roone, near Bittsén, in Hungary, on
                            the 7th of December, 1875, and is the son of John Schwabek, who
                            emigrated to America also, and was naturalized at Baltimore in the year
                            1884. Paul Schwabek emigrated to America in the year 1889, when he was
                            13 years of age, and went to live with his father in Baltimore. He
                            continued to reside in America until the present year, when he decided
                            to return to Hungary to visit his mother, who now lives there, his
                            father being dead. He landed in Bremen from New York, and proceeded at
                            once to his native village, Roone, where he arrived on the evening of
                            the 4th of September, 1897. Upon the following morning he was summoned
                            before the local magistrate (Oberstuhlrichter), in Bittsén, charged with
                            having evaded the military service of Hungary, and was forced to serve
                            in the Seventy-first Infantry Regiment of Hungarian Troops of the
                            Line.</p>
                        <p>At the time of his arrest Schwabek declared his American citizenship and
                            showed his passport, issued by the Department of State on the 20th of
                            August, 1897; but as the Hungarian magistrate could not read the
                            passport, he took no official notice of its validity. Thereupon Schwabek
                            appealed to this legation for help.</p>
                        <p>My first step was to inquire, by telegram addressed to the
                            Oberstuhlrichter at Trencsén, on the 21st of September, upon what ground
                            Schwabek had been arrested and enrolled in the army. After waiting a
                            week, during which the magistrate made no reply, I addressed the inquiry
                            to him again, by telegram, on the 28th of September. He answered, by
                            letter dated the 24th of September, that Schwabek had been arrested
                            because he had failed to perform his military duty and was not able to
                            prove his American citizenship. I replied by letter on the 30th of
                            September to this communication, which had erroneously been sent to the
                            United States consulate-general and was forwarded by him, that Schwabek
                            had a passport, which was proof of his American citizenship; and I asked
                            that, as this American citizen had been arrested without cause, he
                            should be set at liberty. I offered at the same time to authenticate the
                            passport if the magistrate would send it here for that purpose. In reply
                            to this the magistrate wrote me on the 3d of October that, as he had not
                            considered Schwabek’s passport a sufficient proof of his American
                            citizenship, he had found it necessary <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0056"/>to proceed according to the laws of Hungary; that,
                            consequently, Schwabek’s case had been referred to the superior
                            authorities, and would ultimately be decided by the Hungarian ministry
                            of public defense, bat that he could not comply with my request to set
                            Schwabek at liberty. He assured me, however, that the case would be
                            settled “according to law and right,” as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>After waiting for two weeks, during which I hoped to hear that justice
                            had been done to Schwabek by the authorities of Hungary, and that I
                            should not be forced to address the Imperial Government upon the
                            subject, not having received any further communication, I forwarded a
                            dispatch on the 19th of October to Count Goluchowski, minister of
                            foreign affairs, in which I stated the case, reminding him that under
                            the laws of the United States Mr. Schwabek had become an American
                            citizen through the naturalization of his father, he having dwelt in the
                            United States with his father while yet a minor, and that he had a
                            passport to prove his citizenship. I asked the Count Goluchowski to take
                            proper steps to have Schwabek released at once, and also to instruct the
                            authorities of Trencsén to give in all cases due credence and respect to

                        <p>On the 5th of November Mr. Schwabek wrote me to say that he had been set

                            informed me in a preliminary dispatch, dated the 19th of November, and a
                            supplementary note of the 20th of December, that Paul Schwabek’s
                            American citizenship had been fully established and his name stricken

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary of State</hi>: Pursuant to
                            instructions, I have the honor to invite your attention to the
                            provisions of the tariff bill now before the Senate of the United States
                            which relates to the duty on sugar, and conflict, on the one hand, with
                            our right of the most favored nation treatment, and on the other
                            threatens to heavily damage Austro-Hungarian exports.</p>
                        <p>The above-mentioned bill provides, namely, in Schedule E, No. 206, that
                            sugar exported from such countries which grant a direct or indirect
                            bounty shall pay, apart from the actual duty upon entrance set forth in
                            No. 206, an additional duty to the amount of the bounty granted, so far
                            as this bounty shall be in excess of any internal tax collected upon
                            such sugars or upon the raw materials (beet or cane) used in their
                            manufacture.</p>
                        <p>The question of the discriminating tariff treatment against our sugar has
                            already been the subject of negotiation between the Imperial and Royal
                            Government and the Government of the United States. The Imperial and
                            Royal Government had looked upon the additional duty of one-tenth per
                            pound upon sugar coming from Austro-Hungary provided for in the tariff
                            act of August 28, 1894, as a violation of the right of the most favored
                            nation granted to her by Article V of the treaty of 1829, and instructed
                            me on that occasion to protest against it.</p>
                        <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0057"/>
                        <p>This instruction I had the honor to carry out in a note of January 3,
                            1895, to Secretary Gresham, and I therefore consider it unnecessary to
                            repeat here the views advanced therein which my Government entertains
                            to-day in their entirety. On the other hand, I beg to call attention to
                            the fact that the Government of the United States has recognized our
                            right to protest against any additional duty upon our sugar which is
                            based upon our export bounty, as it will appear from the report of
                            Secretary Gresham to the President, of October 12, 1894, and that the
                            President in his annual message of December, 1894, recommended to
                            Congress the repeal of the additional duty in question.</p>
                        <p>The bill now pending in Congress has in view a much greater increase of
                            the discriminating additional duty on sugar, and threatens, therefore,
                            our trade with the United States with new injury. In view thereof the
                            Imperial and Royal Government has instructed me to call the attention of
                            the Federal Government to the disposition of these proposed provision;
                            to infringe upon treaty obligations, and in connection therewith to
                            express the hope that it will lend its assistance in order to enlighten
                            Congress upon the existing treaty obligations between our countries, and
                            to prevent that the proposed increase of the additional duty upon our
                            sugar, against which the Imperial and Royal Government must further
                            protest, should become a law.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: Referring to the matter
                            which arose in connection with the case of Mr. Braun, relative to the
                            form of the oath to be taken by Austrian or Hungarian subjects who
                            desire to become citizens of the United States, and referring
                            furthermore to the statements which your excellency had the kindness to
                            make to Mr. von Hengelmüller, the Imperial and Royal envoy, I now have
                            the honor, in <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0058"/>pursuance of
                            instructions received, to submit the following remarks concerning the
                            adoption of a form for the oath to be taken by Austrians or Hungarians
                            who seek to become American citizens, which shall fully meet the
                            requirements of the political relations of the Austro-Hungarian
                            Monarchy.</p>
                        <p>The object desired can be attained only by such a wording of the oath as
                            shall mention the fact of the existence of separate Austrian and
                            Hungarian citizenship, and shall also, in referring to the sovereign
                            allegiance to whom is renounced by the person relinquishing his Austrian
                            or Hungarian citizenship, make express mention of the joint character of
                            the ruler, who unites the two constituent parts of the monarchy under
                            his scepter.</p>
                        <p>Conformably to these considerations the oath in question should be so
                            worded as to state (according as the person seeking to become an
                            American citizen is a citizen of Austria or of Hungary) that such person
                            renounces his “Austrian” or “Hungarian” citizenship. To this statement
                            (whether the applicant for American naturalization is an Austrian or a
                            Hungarian) the following words might be appended, as they appear in
                            substance, in the oaths now used in the United States: “and to renounce
                            forever all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate,
                            state, or sovereignty, and particularly to His Majesty the Emperor of
                            Austria and Apostolic King of Hungary.”</p>
                        <p>Trusting that this suggestion will meet your excellency’s approval, and
                            that due notice to that effect will kindly be communicated to the
                            district courts of the United States, I avail myself, etc.,</p>

                            applications for the quarter ending June 30 last, which accompanied Mr.
                            Ewing’s dispatch No. 235, have been received.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the case of Edward Otto Beyer, it is observed that the
                            passport was granted without the production of his naturalization
                            certificate, Mr. Ewing being “satisfied the above-named Edward Otto
                            Beyer is the identical person,” etc. Only under exceptional
                            circumstances should a passport be issued to a naturalized citizen
                            without a previous inspection of his naturalization certificate.
                            Occasionally, when the good faith of the applicant is palpable and the
                            refusal to issue the passport might work hardship, the fact that he has
                            lost or left behind him his certificate may not operate to cause the

                            should be always set forth and the applicant’s sworn statement of them

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to request instructions
                            from the Department regarding the issuance of a passport under the
                            following state of facts:</p>
                        <p>On the 11th day of January, 1875, my predecessor then in office, Mr.
                            Jones, issued a passport, No. 345, to “Mr. M. D. Hennessy, wife, and
                            son.” No record exists as to the evidence of citizenship then shown, nor
                            am I advised whether at that time the regulations of the Department
                            called for the production of certificate of naturalization. I am
                            informed, however, that Mr. Hennessy was personally well known to the
                            minister, Mr. Jones, at the time of his appointment as minister, having
                            been president of one of the street-car lines of Chicago while Mr.
                            Hennessy was president of another line in the same city.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hennessy, of whose identity I am entirely convinced, applies to me
                            for a new passport, but without his old passport, which has long ago
                            been mislaid or lost, and without naturalization papers.</p>
                        <p>He was naturalized in Somerset, Perry County, Ohio, and read law in
                            Cincinnati. He recorded a certified copy of his naturalization
                            certificate <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0060"/>in Chicago, but can
                            not obtain a copy there as all the records of Cook County were destroyed
                            by the Chicago fire. He subsequently applied for another certified copy
                            from Perry County, Ohio, and was officially informed that the records of
                            that county had also been destroyed by fire. Coming to Europe with his
                            family shortly before January, 1875, and knowing the then minister at
                            this post, he took out the passport I have mentioned. His wife is dead,
                            his son has been educated in Europe, and he himself has spent most of
                            his time in the south of Europe since 1875 on account of his health,
                            returning, however, from time to time for business purposes. He is still
                            a taxpayer of Rock-ford, in the State of Illinois, and has never had any
                            intention of forfeiting his citizenship. He applies to this legation for
                            a passport, supposing that one having been issued to him another would
                            be, as a matter of course.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the instructions on this subject, and more particularly
                            having in mind the letter of the Department, No. 7, addressed to my
                            predecessor, Mr. Ewing, July 23, 1897, I have declined to issue a
                            passport to Mr. Hennessy until I receive further instructions from the
                            Department on the subject.</p>
                        <p>I have ventured, however, to promise Mr. Hennessy that I would request of
                            the Department a telegraphic reply to this letter, the expense of which
                            will be reimbursed the Department. If this course can be followed it
                            would save Mr. Hennessy some inconvenient delay in Belgium.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            dispatch No. 16, of the 18th ultimo, submitting to the Department the
                            application of Mr. M. D. Hennessy for a passport.</p>
                        <p>You state that your predecessor issued a passport on January 11, 1875, to
                            Mr. Hennessy, wife, and son, and that he now applies to you for a new
                            passport, but that he is unable to present his certificate of
                            naturalization, being of alien birth, alleging that it has been
                            destroyed by fire. You ask for instructions as to your duty in this case
                            and in similar applications which may come before you. In reply you are
                            informed that the requirement that a person of alien birth should
                            produce his certificate of naturalization when making application for a
                            passport is of long standing and should be carefully enforced; but
                            sometimes, through the loss or destruction of the document, it is
                            necessary to make an exception to the rule when the issuing official is
                            satisfied of the good faith of the application and when its rejection
                            might result in serious inconvenience or hardship. The nature of the
                            secondary evidence which may be required is governed by the
                            circumstances surrounding each case, but the general rule laid down in
                            Mr. Bayard’s instruction to Mr. Vignaud, June 13, 1888 (<ref target="frus1888p1#pg_542">Foreign Relations, 1888, p. 542</ref>),
                            appears to be applicable to the case under consideration:</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The prior existence of the certificate must be
                            shown.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) If burned or otherwise destroyed, such
                            destruction of the certificate must be proved. * * *</p>
                        <p>A party who can not produce his naturalization certificate can not supply
                            it by parole proof unless he also proves that the original record of the
                            naturalization is unattainable and can not be reproduced by a certified
                            copy.</p>
                        <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0061"/>
                        <p>In issuing Mr. Hennessy a passport under the conditions set forth above
                            it would be well to advise him that for his future protection and
                            convenience he should make an effort to have the record of his
                            naturalization restored. As it was, according to his statement, recorded
                            in a Chicago court, it is thought he may be able to accomplish its
                            restoration under the “burnt record act” passed by the Illinois
                            legislature some years since for the relief of persons in Mr. Hennessy’s
                            situation.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to request instructions
                            for issuing a passport under the following circumstances:</p>
                        <p>A person representing himself to be Elea Luboschey presents to-day
                            passport No. 6410, purporting to be issued by the State Department
                            January 6, 1894, evidently stamped and not signed “W. Q. Gresham.”</p>
                        <p>The personage presenting it is correctly described in the passport, and
                            states that he is a child of a man who was a naturalized citizen of the
                            United States while his son was under the age of 21 and living in
                            Chicago. He has no proof, except his possession of the passport, and his
                            resemblance to the description, that he is the person named therein, and
                            the passport itself is in very bad condition.</p>
                        <p>He can not supply any of the information called for in the affidavit set
                            out in form No. 178, as he does not know the year of his father’s
                            naturalization or the date when his father emigrated from Russia. As the
                            passport was visaed April 14, 1894, by the consul-general at Berlin, and
                            as his description is accurate, I should have given him a new one had it
                            been within the two years. His appearance, his birthplace (Russia), and
                            his own statement that he has been in Siberia and recently came from
                            Spain led me to decline to issue a passport to him unless the records in
                            the State Department under passport No. 6410 show that at that time he
                            was able to give a satisfactory account of the naturalization of his
                            father and his own identity.</p>
                        <p>If the Department will inform me whether the records there show this fact
                            and that in consequence I am authorized to issue him a passport on
                            taking up the old one, I shall act accordingly.</p>

                            No. 24, of the 4th instant, in regard to the application of Elea
                            Luboschey for a passport.</p>
                        <p>The records of the Department show that Elea Luboschey received from it a
                            passport, dated January 6, 1894, and numbered 6410, on proof of his own
                            naturalization before the superior court of Illinois at Chicago on
                            November 14, 1893. It not infrequently happens that the son of a
                            naturalized citizen of the United States secures naturalization in his
                                <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0062"/>own right because of the
                            difficulty of proving his father’s naturalization. I inclose a copy of
                            the application of Mr. Luboschey on which the Department issued him a
                            passport, in order that you may examine carefully the applicant before
                            your legation. If his identity with the person who received the passport
                            from the Department is satisfactory to you, a new passport may be issued
                            to him if he be found entitled to it in other respects.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the stamped signature on his old passport, I have to
                            inform you that on all passports issued by Mr. Gresham the signature was
                            stamped. This was also the case with passports issued during the terms
                            of Secretaries Seward, Evarts, Blaine, Foster, and Olney, and is the
                            custom at the present time. On passports issued by Secretaries Fish and
                            Bayard the signature was in writing.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to report the following case in
                            order that the facts may be in the possession of the Department should
                            occasion arise to ask instructions:</p>
                        <p>Stephan E. Bayer presents himself, asking whether or no he is an American
                            citizen and entitled to the protection of a passport.</p>
                        <p>He shows his certificate of birth in Dresden in the year 1871, issued by
                            an Israelite rabbi. This certificate was not given until January 18,
                            1876, and recites that this child was the son of Elias Bayer, citizen of
                            New York, and of Elise, his wife. On the back of this certificate of
                            birth or “Geburtschein” is a certificate of the United State consul at
                            Dresden as to the genuineness of the rabbi’s signature, and in this
                            certificate the consul recites that both Elias Bayer and his wife are
                            citizens of the United States and residents of New York City. This
                            certificate is under the consular seal. The applicant further is in
                            possession of passport 13217, issued by the State Department to Elias
                            Bayer November 18, 1884, covering himself, his wife, and two minor
                            children. The applicant, who seems to speak with the utmost frankness,
                            says that Elias Bayer, the father, unmarried, went to America from
                            Germany in 1857 or 1858; that he came back to Dresden in 1869 or 1870,
                            and there, in 1870, married his wife; that he himself is one of the two
                            minor children spoken of in the passport, and his sister, now living, is
                            the other.</p>
                        <p>The father, Elias Bayer, went back to America alone in 1884, and stayed
                            three months, obtaining this passport at that time. Neither the mother
                            nor either of the two children has ever been to America, nor has their
                            father ever been back since 1884.</p>
                        <p>He states that his father always calls himself an American citizen, as he
                            himself has also always done; that at the age military service was due
                            from him to the German Government he was in Berlin, told the chief of
                            police that he was an American citizen, and in proof gave him the
                            “Geburtschein” and consular certificate that I have described. He says
                            that the chief of police retained the paper for some time; that when the
                            military authorities sought his service he referred them to the chief of
                            police, and finally this certificate was returned to him and <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0063"/>he never was troubled in the matter
                            further. He now comes to Brussels, has registered himself at the city
                            hall as an American citizen, saying that he can not call himself
                            anything else. Should he call himself a German, he may be pursued for
                            military service, and should he refuse to give any nationality he may be
                            expelled from Belgium.</p>
                        <p>I refused to issue him a passport.</p>
                        <p>From the nature of the case it is possible some future complication may
                            arise, and, as I stated, I thought it well that the matter should be in
                            possession of the Department for reference in case of
                            correspondence.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your No. 42, of the 26th ultimo, has been
                            received. You therein state the facts in the case of Stephan E. Bayer
                            upon which you have refused to issue to him a passport.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bayer asks whether he is an American citizen and whether he is
                            entitled to the protection of a passport. Determination of the fact of
                            citizenship is not an executive function. What is reserved to the
                            executive is the use of its proper discretion as to the protection of a
                            person abroad when the facts prima facie establish his citizenship by
                            origin or naturalization, and the issuance of a passport is part of the
                            exercise of that discretion. The question simply is whether the
                            circumstances of Stephan E. Bayer’s origin and residence abroad are
                            consonant with citizenship on the face of the facts and with continued
                            protection while he sojourns without the territory of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The essential fact to be ascertained is whether at the time of Stephan E.
                            Bayer’s birth abroad his father, Elias Bayer, was a citizen of the
                            United States, and entitled, while so residing in a foreign country, to
                            the continued protection of this Government.</p>
                        <p>The records show that Elias Bayer, the father, was naturalized before the
                            supreme court of New York on May 12, 1868. A few days thereafter he
                            received from the Department passport No. 37399, dated May 22, 1868.
                            Sixteen years later another passport (No. 13217) was issued to him by
                            the Department on November 18, 1884, upon surrender of the old one. No
                            record appears of the issuance of any other passport in his favor
                            between the dates mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Stephan E. Bayer was born in Dresden in 1871, only three years after the
                            naturalization and return to Germany of his father. There is nothing
                            adduced to suggest that the father, Elias, by unduly prolonged residence
                            abroad then—as has been seen, only about three years—or by any other
                            act, had renounced his acquired status. He is to be assumed to be an
                            American citizen by birth abroad of American parents, unless he has lost
                            such citizenship since he reached majority. Section 1993, Revised
                            Statutes, expressly meets the circumstances of a child so born abroad
                            never residing in the United States. Germany, it would seem, has never
                            made adverse claim to his allegiance, so that the abstract question of
                            his right of option between two conflicting allegiances upon reaching
                            majority is not material to the case. Under German law and treaty it
                            would seem that no proper claim to his allegiance can be made by
                            Germany. Belgium, the country of his present <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0064"/>residence, has obviously no claim thereto. The case is
                            to be treated precisely like that of a native-born citizen of the United
                            States who has gone abroad and remained six years—the time which has
                            elapsed since Stephan E. Bayer came of age. Such person would doubtless
                            be required to show, before a passport could be issued to him, that he
                            intended to return to the United States within some reasonably definite
                            period, or at least that he had a definite intention to return for the
                            purpose of residing here permanently. In other words, in such case, upon
                            compliance with the usual requirements, a passport would be granted,
                            warning the applicant of the necessity of properly conserving his
                            citizenship in the future.</p>
                        <p>If Stephan E. Bayer meets the presumption created against any valid
                            intent to come to the United States, resulting from the circumstances of
                            his long residence abroad, and fully complies with the prescribed
                            requirements, including declaration of intention to return to and reside
                            in the United States, there would seem to be no reason why a passport
                            should be refused to him unless his expressed intention be negatived by
                            facts or circumstances known to you.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to ask whether the facts
                            I submit to you can make a difference in the opinion of the Department
                            once given in the same case. Mrs. Marie Klugmann obtained a passport
                            from my predecessor, Mr. Ewing, April 1, 1895, which is numbered 45. She
                            applies to this legation, showing the former passport, in view of the
                            letter of the Department on this subject to Mr. Ewing, numbered 150,
                            bearing date of July 15, 1895. I had no alternative but to decline to
                            issue a new passport.</p>
                        <p>The following facts, however, would seem to appeal with great weight to
                            the discretion of the Department: Mrs. Klugmann was told at the time
                            when she took out her passport, in 1895, that she would always have the
                            right to a renewal of the same on the return of the former one. She was
                            never informed in any way of the view taken of her legal rights by the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>Last spring she left her husband and several children in Russia in order
                            to visit her married daughter at Lille, France. On her way there through
                            Brussels she expected to apply for a renewal of her passport, but got
                            the impression some way or other that the minister was not in town, and
                            consequently did not make the application. Her return to Brussels from
                            Lille in order to get a new passport was delayed by the birth of a
                            grandchild, and she has made no application until now, on the eve of her
                            departure to her home and family in Russia.</p>
                        <p>My inability to issue her a passport falls on her and her family as a
                            great misfortune, as well as an apparent injustice, since she can not
                            cross the Russian frontier without it. She states under oath that it is
                            the intention of her husband and herself to go with their children to
                            the United States in March next, where his sister and her family are now
                            living, and in this statement she is emphatically supported by the
                            affirmation of her son-in-law, a very intelligent French gentleman, <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0065"/>engaged in business in Lille and
                            well known in Brussels. They are people of large means in Russia and own
                            property in New York, but whether real or personal Mrs. Klugmann could
                            not inform me.</p>
                        <p>I am convinced of the truth of the statements made, and the case is one
                            in which it seems to me the Department might without risk make an
                            exception to its general ruling and instruct me to issue the passport.
                            Of course, in the force of the disapproval of the issuing of the first
                            passport, I can take no action except under instructions from you.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your No. 43, of the 26th ultimo, presents
                            anew the case of Mrs. Marie Klugmann, and, on the grounds therein
                            advanced, inquires whether the Department may not review its instruction
                            to your predecessor, No. 150, of July 15, 1895, and permit the issuance
                            to Mrs. Klugmann of the passport she needs in order to go to Russia,
                            there to rejoin her husband and children, with a view to the return of
                            the family to the United States in March next, as she states it is their
                            intention to do.</p>
                        <p>The case presents embarrassing features. Both the son, Adolph Klugmann,
                            and the wife, Marie, are declared in the applications upon which Mr.
                            Ewing granted them separate passports April 1, 1895, to have been born
                            in Russia, the son at Saratoff and the wife at St. Petersburg. The given
                            name of the husband is not stated, and nothing is reported by you
                            regarding him save that he would seem to have quitted the United States
                            soon after his naturalization and is now residing in Russia.</p>
                        <p>There are on file in this Department the oaths of allegiance upon which
                            separate passports were issued September 5, 1883, to Jacob Klugmann and
                            Marie Klugmann by the United States legation at St. Petersburg, but as
                            the regulations did not then require the transmission of duplicate
                            applications to the Department the facts upon which those passports were
                            granted can not now be ascertained, unless from that legation.</p>
                        <p>There are also on file applications upon which passports Nos. 1334 and
                            1335 were issued by the United States legation at Berlin December 10,
                            1891, to Jacob Klugmann and Marie Klugmann, respectively, in lieu of the
                            previous passports issued at St. Petersburg September 5, 1883. Jacob
                            Klugmann therein declares birth at Tilsit, Germany, naturalization at
                            New York October 20, 1868; last departure from New York in 1871,
                            residence at St. Petersburg, and purpose to return to the United States
                            within two years. His wife also declares like intent in the separate
                            application. She does not allege to have ever been in the United States,
                            and the application of the son, Adolph, in 1895, indicates the domicile
                            of his parents in Russia, at Saratoff, as early as February 7, 1875,
                            when he was born.</p>
                        <p>The right of Mrs. Klugmann to protection depends upon the like right of
                            her husband. On the face of the known facts he, a naturalized citizen,
                            has for twenty-six years withdrawn himself from the country of his
                            adoption and resided for most of that time in the country of his wife’s
                            origin. His last passport, obtained in 1891 through another <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0066"/>legation than in the country of his
                            residence, swears to the intent to return to the United States within
                            two years, which he has not done, although six years have since elapsed.
                            It would require very positive proof of fact to overcome the presumption
                            that Jacob Klugmann has long abandoned the right to protection while
                            residing abroad. If his application were under consideration on the
                            stated facts a passport would be refused.</p>
                        <p>The foreign-born wife can only claim protection through her husband’s
                            citizenship. It seems she has never been in the United States and can
                            claim no independent status as a citizen, notwithstanding what appears
                            to have been her systematic procurement of separate passports at various
                            missions outside of Russia, in each of which instances a purpose to come
                            to the United States within two years is declared on oath.</p>
                        <p>The case of the son, Adolph, is somewhat different. If it be established
                            that at the date of his birth in Russia, February 7, 1875, his father,
                            Jacob, was still a citizen in good standing, and as such entitled to
                            protection, Adolph Klugmann’s case may, and probably does, fall under
                            the provisions of section 1993, Revised Statutes, and although he has
                            passed his majority by nearly two years, he might be granted a passport
                            to enable him to come within the immediate future to the United States,
                            here to reside and fulfill the obligations of a citizen. If now in
                            Russia, his application should be made to the United States minister at
                            St. Petersburg, to whom copy of the correspondence in this case will be
                            sent for information.</p>
                        <p>If Jacob Klugmann, the husband, should make application to the legation
                            at St. Petersburg and establish facts in his favor to overcome the
                            adverse presumptions created by the circumstances of his prolonged
                            residence abroad, the issuance of a passport to him would include his
                            wife in the title to protection. But unless the status and right of the
                            husband be so established the Department can not authorize the issuance
                            of a fresh passport to the wife, Marie Klugmann.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It seems proper, before you enter upon the
                            duties of your post, to direct your especial attention to a matter
                            which, for a number of years past, has been the occasion of
                            correspondence between the Governments of the United States and Belgium,
                            and which, by reason of the obnoxious and differential treatment of the
                            matter in Belgium, has become a subject of grave concern to this
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>I refer to the prohibition of American cattle, sheep, and fresh beef by
                            Belgium, as being a serious and apparently arbitrary interference with
                            the trade of this country, which has been adopted and maintained without
                            any adequate reason.</p>
                        <p>The instructions on file in your legation will show the elaborate proof
                            submitted by this Government that no dangerous diseases of cattle and
                            sheep exist in this country which would endanger the live stock of
                            Belgium, and that no diseases have, in fact, been communicated by the
                                <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0067"/>cattle of this country to
                            those of Belgium. Even assuming, for argument’s sake, that such diseases
                            did exist here, or had been shown to be communicable, the regulations
                            adopted by Great Britain, whereby animals are allowed to be landed and
                            slaughtered at the wharves under quarantine restrictions would he a
                            complete protection. No such measure of relief is, however, afforded. On
                            the contrary, the Belgian prohibition goes much further, and extends to
                            dressed beef. This prohibition is entirely unnecessary in fact, and is
                            the more objectionable in as-much as the Government of the United States
                            inspects and certifies to the healthfulness of all beef which is
                            permitted shipment to all European countries. The subject is one of
                            obvious interest to both countries and the benefits of the trade are
                            mutual, as are the disadvantages of its prohibition. A populous country
                            like Belgium, of comparatively limited area, must necessarily look
                            abroad for a notable share of its food supplies and naturally must look
                            in the most healthful and cheapest market, which the United States are
                            prepared to furnish. An unrestricted trade in meat-producing animals and
                            other products, if they received fair treatment in the Belgian markets,
                            would doubtless soon develop and become an important item of our
                            agricultural exports, while the quality and price of such products would
                            benefit the Belgian consumer.</p>
                        <p>The immediate occasion of this instruction is found in a letter received
                            by me from the Secretary of Agriculture, under date of May 22, with
                            which is included a letter addressed by Messrs. Thomas Ronaldson &amp;
                            Co., of Antwerp, to their London house, in which certain statements in
                            the matter are said to have been made in the course of an interview of
                            the Antwerp Chamber of Commerce with Minister De Bruyn, at Brussels.
                            Copy of these is inclosed for your fuller information.</p>
                        <p>It is desired that as soon as practicable after you shall have entered on
                            the duties of your office you shall seek an interview with the minister
                            for foreign affairs, and, if possible, through his kindly intervention,
                            obtain opportunity to confer with the minister having charge of the
                            matter in question. You will endeavor to impress upon the Belgian
                            authorities the earnest conviction of the Government of the United
                            States that the exclusion of American cattle from Belgium is as
                            indefensible in point of fact as their prohibition of our meat products
                            is irrational. You will invite their attention to the fact that the
                            United States, notwithstanding their enormous area and the vast
                            production of marketable live stock, have accomplished what no European
                            government appears to have yet succeeded in doing under much more
                            favorable auspices, and have exterminated pleura-pneumonia in this
                            country. You will show the extraordinary precautions taken in the
                            transportation of cattle through our own territory, and in their
                            exportation therefrom, to insure absolute healthfulness at every stage
                            from the breeding farm to the ship. You will advert to the elaborate
                            measures adopted by this country to inspect all animal food products
                            before exportation, and to testify to the healthfulness thereof—a system
                            which, if it exists in any country in Europe, can not be more thoroughly
                            organized or effective than ours is. And, without appearing to make any
                            threatening prognosis, you will advert to the bad effects which the
                            continuance of this causeless Belgian prohibition of our meat animals
                            and meat products must invariably create in the minds of the national
                            legislators, and the danger that countervailing action of some kind may
                            be taken. It is the earnest desire of this Government to avoid all
                            retaliatory measures, as well as pretext for retaliation.</p>
                        <p>As the Belgian Government must abundantly know by this time, the United
                            States Government has gone out of its way to meet the technical <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0068"/>and often apparently unreasonable
                            objections of foreign governments and has adopted at great cost to
                            itself a Federal inspection of food products unequaled in thoroughness
                            and in the magnitude of its operations by any system of inspection known
                            in other countries; and that, through the concurrence of the national
                            Congress, laws have been passed giving to the executive officers of this
                            Government powers of inspection and repression which the domestic
                            interest of our farmers and consumers might not alone have sufficed to
                            accord. If the true objection in Belgium, or in any other quarter, be
                            not against a condition of the product which it is sought to export, but
                            against any exportation of food animals or food products from this
                            country to Belgium, it is but due to international comity that the facts
                            should be frankly viewed, in order that they may be dealt with in equal
                            frankness.</p>
                        <p>You will report from time to time the result of the representations you
                            are instructed to make, and should it be represented to you that the
                            prohibitory measures of Belgium rest upon or respond to the prohibitory
                            legislation of England, Germany, or any other country, you may confer
                            with the United States representatives in those countries, communicating
                            for their information such facts in this relation as you may be able to
                            obtain.</p>
                        <p>A copy of this instruction will be furnished to the United States
                            ambassadors at London and Berlin for their information.</p>

                                is a serious, and apparently arbitrary, interference with the trade
                                of this country, which has been adopted and maintained without any
                                adequate reason. No diseases have been communicated by the cattle of
                                this country to those of Belgium, and there are no dangerous
                                diseases of such animals existing here which would endanger the live
                                stock of that country. But even if there were such diseases the
                                regulations adopted by Great Britain, allowing animals to be landed
                                and slaughtered at the wharves, under quarantine restrictions, would
                                be a complete protection. The prohibition of dressed beef apparently
                                has no grounds for its support except the desire of the Agrarian
                                party to prevent competition. This is the more evident as our
                                Government inspects and certifies to the healthfulness of all beef
                                which is permitted shipment to European countries. A prohibition for
                                such a purpose ought not, however, to be tolerated by this
                                Government, and I would urge for your consideration the question as
                                to whether the time has <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0069"/>not
                                come when the Belgian Government should be plainly informed that the
                                prohibition of American products must inevitably and speedily lead
                                to the prohibition of Belgian products by this country.</p>
                            <p>It appears from the letter of Thomas Ronaldson &amp; Co., that
                                Minister De Bruyn would not be surprised at receiving such a
                                communication from this Government, and that it might lead to a
                                reconsideration of the orders now in force. An unrestricted trade in
                                meat-producing animals and their products, if it received fair
                                treatment in the Belgian markets, would soon develop and become a
                                very large item of our agricultural exports. I trust that the
                                Department of State will take up this matter and press it vigorously
                                until American exporters receive just and fair treatment in the
                                markets of Belgium.</p>
                            <p>Very respectfully,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sirs</hi>: Cattle prohibition: We beg to
                                advise you that in compliance with our persistent demands the
                                chamber of commerce have obtained an interview with Minister De
                                Bruyn at Brussels a day or two ago.</p>
                            <p>The deputation consisted of Mr. W. Linden, president, and Mr. Corty,
                                secretary, of the chamber; Mr. Morren, representing the importers
                                from the Plate; and Mr. Gregoir, representing the importers from the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>At the interview these gentlemen fully exposed the present position,
                                and obtained an expression of opinion from the minister which fully
                                confirms what we have always said, viz, that only direct pressure
                                from the Governments interested, in the shape of a threat of
                                retaliation, will bring about a withdrawal of the prohibitory
                                restrictions.</p>
                            <p>The Plate shippers are now interested, seeing that by a recent
                                ministerial order all cattle and sheep coming from the Plate or
                                elsewhere, except the United States and Canada, must be slaughtered
                                within three days of being landed here. In the case of the United
                                States and Canada cattle are, of course, absolutely prohibited: Now,
                                it is evident that this new restriction means total prohibition
                                against Plate importations, because to compel importers to slaughter
                                within three days would land them every time in a huge loss, as
                                there is no tremendous demand in this small country, as there is in
                                London, Liverpool, etc.</p>
                            <p>The minister stated that in regard to sheep he thought the measures
                                were too drastic, and that he would be prepared to assist importers
                                when the various shipments arrived, but this without making any
                                definite amendment of the law.</p>
                            <p>As to cattle, he stated that the pressure brought to bear upon him by
                                the agricultural party was such that he could not see his way to do
                                anything but strictly follow the law as laid down by the royal and
                                ministerial decrees.</p>
                            <p>When the deputation pointed out that it was illogical to close the
                                frontier against cattle coming from the River Plate, where diseases
                                had never been known, and from the United States and Canada, where
                                only one case (and that contested) of pleuro-pneumonia had ever been
                                stated, while the frontier was continually open for some time to
                                cattle coming from Holland and Germany, where pleuro-pneumonia and
                                foot-and-mouth disease were continually prevalent, he replied, “Yes,
                                it was illogical, but it was the law and he had to follow it.” He
                                added that until the countries interested made a direct threat of
                                retaliation, so that he might go to the agriculturists and show them
                                a good reason for reopening the frontier, nothing would be done.
                                This is what we have always said, and we are more than ever
                                convinced that until the Government at Washington do insist, nothing
                                will be done to relieve us of these scandalous prohibitory
                                restrictions.</p>
                            <p>We hand you herewith copy of a circular issued by Mr. Gregoir, which
                                confirms what we have now advised you as to the interview with
                                Minister DeBruyn. Please return this, as we wish to send it by

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am in receipt of your letter of the
                                10th instant in regard to the status of affairs in Belgium relative
                                to the trade in American agricultural products, and particularly to
                                animals and meats. It affords me pleasure to learn that you have
                                given the matter so much attention, and fully informed yourself as
                                to the present status of affairs. There is no doubt but that, so far
                                as the exportation of live animals to Belgium is concerned, the
                                trade should be satisfied with an extension of the time animals may
                                be held before slaughter. The present limit of three days is too
                                short a time and does not give an opportunity for the animals to
                                recover from the effects of the voyage, nor does it allow time to
                                find purchasers and dispose of the animals to advantage. The limit
                                should be two weeks instead of three days; or if two weeks can not
                                be obtained, then certainly ten days should be granted.</p>
                            <p>The Belgian Government should also be willing to admit American fresh
                                meats which have been inspected by this Department, and which bear
                                the inspection marks and are accompanied by certificates of
                                inspection. This inspection is made by our Government, and the
                                certificate is a Government certificate. The refusal to accept this
                                certificate and admit such inspected meats is an official
                                announcement that the Belgian Government is suspicious of this
                                inspection and of the guarantee <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0071"/>which our Government gives with, the meat. This
                                Government can hardly permit without emphatic protest such
                                questioning of its official work and such implied doubts as to its
                                good faith. I hope you will urge this matter upon the Belgian
                                Government, and endeavor to secure the concessions in regard to live
                                animals and fresh meats which are mentioned above.</p>
                            <p>There is every reason to desire friendly relations with the Belgian
                                Government, and that the arbitrary interference with trade which has
                                been begun by that Government may be stopped before it is necessary
                                to adopt retaliatory measures bearing upon Belgian exports to the
                                United States. It appears from our statistics that we receive over
                                $200,000 of meat products from Belgium annually, and nearly $200,000
                                worth of wines. If we continue to receive these products from the
                                Belgian farms without other restrictions than the regular tariffs
                                imposed by law, it will be expected by our people that the Belgian
                                Government should receive the products of our farms in the same
                                friendly manner. I hope you may be able to convince the Belgian
                                Government that an exchange of products upon this liberal basis is
                                only giving fair and just consideration to the international
                                traffic, and that arbitrary prohibitions under the form of sanitary
                                regulations which go beyond the steps necessary to guard against
                                disease are undesirable.</p>
                            <p>I note your statement that the Department of State has already
                                instructed you to give this matter early attention, and I hope that
                                you will present it as early and as vigorously as is possible.</p>
                            <p>Very respectfully,</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary of State</hi>: In accordance with

                            your excellency a request for the purpose of obtaining that the system
                            of favorable discrimination which is exercised in regard to tonnage dues
                            in the United States ports to vessels from German and Dutch ports be
                            extended to vessels arriving from the ports of Belgium.</p>
                        <p>My Government believes it has a right to this favorable discrimination,
                            based upon reciprocity, for the following reasons: <list>

                                    been very considerably reduced. At present they nowhere exceed

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On receipt of your dispatch No. 228 of
                            November 28, 1896, I addressed a letter to the minister for foreign
                            affairs in order to be furnished with full information as to the taxes
                            levied on vessels entering the Belgian ports, and expressed the desire
                            to be informed also whether there exists any discrimination between
                            American vessels and vessels of Belgian origin entering the said
                            ports.</p>
                        <p>I have just received, in reply to my communication, a note which, it is
                            claimed, contains complete information on the subject. A copy of this
                            note I inclose herewith, together with a translation into English.</p>

                        <p>In transmitting this note, which has been prepared by the minister of

                            marine) in collaboration with his colleague, the minister of finance,
                            the minister of foreign affairs desires to state that the taxes or
                            duties to be paid by vessels entering the Belgian ports represent in
                            fact the value of services rendered only, and that in levying such
                            duties no distinction is made between Belgian and American vessels. He
                            therefore expresses the hope that our Government, considering this fact,
                            will not hesitate to exempt from tonnage dues Belgian vessels entering

                            <p>In the ports of Antwerp, Ghent, and Ostend wharfage and dock dues are
                                levied conformably to the tariffs established for Antwerp by royal
                                decrees of January 25 and 29, 1896 (Annexes 1 and 2), for Ghent, by
                                a communal council order of March 21, 1893 (page 36 of Annex 3), and
                                for Ostend by a royal decree of January 31, 1896 (Annex 4).</p>
                            <p>In consequence of these duties, paid into the city treasuries,
                                vessels find at all hours of the day berths in deep water alongside
                                of quays, lighted, guarded, and provided with sheds and improved
                                machinery for unloading and loading; the docks, with a constant
                                water-level, are also provided with quays, lighted, guarded, and
                                furnished with necessary apparatus.</p>
                            <p>In Belgium, the communal administrations thus furnish to navigation
                                facilities and advantages that are furnished elsewhere by private
                                companies.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of Antwerp alone, the capital immobilized in the
                                construction of the various docks and quays of the Schelde—exclusive
                                of the expenses of the original establishment of special
                                services—amounts to about 120,000,000 francs. The maritime
                                establishments produced in 1896, from harbor dues, about 2,500,000
                                francs, from which 750,000 francs must be deducted for general
                                expenses. The net profit of the capital invested is thus a little
                                less than I£ per cent, while the average rate of interest on the
                                loans which furnished the greater part of the immobilized capital is
                                3.27 per cent.</p>
                            <p>In addition there exist at Antwerp certain optional dues: <list>

                            <p>The communal administration of Ghent also levies for the use of
                                sheds, dry docks, port apparatus, etc., the nonobligatory duties
                                detailed on pages 38 et seq., of Annex III.</p>
                            <p>From the preceding statements it results that the different duties,
                                obligatory or optional, to be paid by vessels in Belgian ports
                                constitute the price of services really rendered, and, that being
                                the case, it matters little, with regard to the interests of
                                navigation, whether these dues are collected by private enterprises
                                or by communal administrations.</p>
                            <p>The navigation duties levied by the State are confined to the
                                wharfage clues established for the outer harbor of Ostend by a royal
                                decree of December 24, 1895. (See the Moniteur of December 29, 1895,
                                Annex XI.) These dues, like those collected by the cities of
                                Antwerp, Ghent, and Ostend, represent the remuneration of the
                                expenses of construction and repair of the quays (Annex XII), and
                                for maritime police (Annex XIII), and to the fee to be paid for
                                issuing bills of health, under the application of the royal decree
                                of April 25, 1868 (see the Moniteur of April 27, 1868), their
                                designation proves that they do not constitute duties properly so
                                called, and can not therefore enter into consideration in the
                                examination of the question raised.</p>
                            <p>Finally, in the application of the various duties and taxes mentioned
                                above no distinction is made between Belgian and American
                                vessels.</p>

                            relative to the request of your Government for the exemption of the
                            vessels of Belgium (clearing from Belgian ports) from tonnage dues in

                            entering the United States from Belgian ports is section 11 of the act
                            of June 19, 1886, which reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    lighthouse dues, or other equivalent tax or taxes, imposed in

                                    in their coasting trade, or with the existence between such

                        <p>The Acting Secretary of the Treasury observes that under this law the
                            tonnage tax now imposed in the United States on vessels entering the
                            United States from Belgian ports is 6 cents per net ton, not to exceed
                            30 cents per annum, while article 1 of the royal Belgian decree, dated
                            January 25, 1896 (Annex 1, Stad Antwerpen, Scheepvaartrechten, 1896),
                            provides: “Seagoing vessels entering the docks will pay to the city <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0075"/>(Antwerp) for each voyage a tax
                            of fifty centimes per net ton Moorson, whatever the number of voyages
                            during the year may be,” and that, moreover, by article 3 vessels
                            discharging or taking on cargo, when not admitted to the docks, are
                            required to pay the same charges, and by the same article a reduction is
                            made in the tonnage dues in cases where the same vessel makes ten
                            voyages or more during the year.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary of the Treasury states, furthermore, that upon an
                            examination it appears to his Department: <list>
                                <item>First. That the tonnage taxes imposed at Antwerp are higher
                                    than those imposed in the United States, the former being about
                                    9 cents per net ton while the latter are but 6 cents; the former
                                    are imposed on each entry of a vessel while the latter are
                                    imposed on not to exceed five entries of the same vessel during
                                    the year.</item>
                                <item>Second. That the taxes are imposed by a foreign Government, as
                                    is shown by the royal sanction of the action of the local
                                    authorities at Antwerp.</item>
                                <item>Third. That the tonnage taxes levied at Antwerp can not be
                                    regarded as strictly dock charges, as they are imposed on
                                    vessels at anchor as well as on those admitted to the
                                    docks.</item>
                                <item>Fourth. That the tonnage taxes appear in effect to be “other
                                    equivalent taxes” to those imposed in the United States. The
                                    fact that tonnage taxes in the United States are devoted to the
                                    maintenance of the marine hospital, while in Belgium they are
                                    applied toward paying interest on extensive harbor improvements,
                                    does not appear to alter the fact that, should the exemption
                                    asked for be granted, vessels from Belgium would be exempted
                                    from taxation in the United States based on tonnage, while
                                    vessels from the United States would continue subject to
                                    taxation in Belgium, based on tonnage. The Government of the
                                    United States expends annually large sums of money to secure
                                    deep water in its harbors, for which no charge is imposed on
                                    vessels, American or foreign, entering those harbors.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In view of these considerations the Treasury Department is of the opinion
                            that the exemption from tonnage taxes of vessels entering the United
                            States from Belgium should not be granted, pursuant to section 11 of the
                            act of June 19, 1886.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Acting Secretary of the Treasury says that it is not
                            deemed necessary to review in detail the Belgian regulations for the
                            harbors of Ghent and Ostend, which are not in principle essentially
                            different from those at Antwerp, or to review optional charges, such as
                            employment of tugs, storage, etc., at Antwerp, which are not involved in
                            the consideration of the application in question.</p>

                            original of the ship’s articles to him for certification, and to be by
                            him affixed to the manifest.</p>
                        <p>As the ship’s articles were, in accordance with the laws and consular
                            regulations of the United States, deposited in the hands of our consular
                            officer at Buenos Aires, and could not be lawfully restored by him to
                            the captain until the latter had presented his manifests, bill of
                            health, duly certified by the Brazilian consular officer, and clearance
                            papers from the Argentine authorities, the captain offered to furnish
                            the Brazilian official with a certified copy of them. This he declined
                            to receive. To prevent detention of the ship, our minister advised the
                            captain and the vice-consul of the United States to present the original
                            to the consul-general, who attached the document, together with his
                            certificate as to its “genuineness,” to the ship’s manifest by a
                            card.</p>
                        <p>The ship’s articles or shipping articles are defined as containing all
                            the conditions of the contract with the crew as to service, pay, voyage,
                            and all other things, and, in accordance with paragraph 194 of the
                            United States Consular Regulations, must be produced by the master to
                            any consular officer of the United States, whenever the latter may think
                            it necessary to the discharge of his duty toward any seaman. They are
                            needed by the consular officer in the case of a dispute between the
                            master and seamen, and on many other occasions. The crew list, shipping
                            articles, and register constitute “the ship’s papers,” and are regarded
                            by international custom, sanctioned expressly or impliedly by most
                            modern commercial and consular treaties, as the national papers of the
                            ship, the originals of which should always be in the custody of the
                            master at sea, and in that of the consular officer of the nation in a
                            foreign port.</p>
                        <p>As above stated, the laws of the United States require, under a penalty
                            of $500, every master of a United States vessel which sails from a port
                            of the United States, on his arrival at a foreign port, to deposit his
                            register, his sea letter, and Mediterranean passport, if he has any,
                            with the consular officer of the United States at the port. Paragraph
                            175 of our Consular Regulations adds that— <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>It is usual also to deposit with the consular officer the crew
                                    list and shipping articles; and these documents, together with
                                    the register, are generally described as the “ship’s
                                    papers.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Article XXXI of the treaty of 1828 between the United States and Brazil
                            (which was abrogated in 1841) indicates that the Brazilian laws, <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0077"/>like our own, contemplated that
                            the ship’s papers, as national papers of the vessels, must be in the
                            hands of either the master or the consul.</p>
                        <p>It provided that the consuls shall have power to require the assistance
                            of the national authorities for the arrest of deserters, “proving by an
                            exhibition of the registers of the vessel, or ship’s roll, or other
                            public documents that those men were part of said crews.” The ship’s
                            articles form a part of this evidence. In the case under consideration
                            they could not have been presented to the Argentine authorities by our
                            consular officer if they had been in the hands of a Brazilian
                            official.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the strength of their evidence as “national” papers is impaired
                            when they bear a certification of their “genuineness” from the official
                            of a foreign nation.</p>
                        <p>In this connection it may be well for you to examine the laws of Brazil
                            in regard to ship’s papers. They are probably, as above indicated, very
                            similar to our own.</p>
                        <p>There has been at times an effort on the part of certain of the South
                            American Republics to require the master of a foreign vessel to deposit
                            the ship’s papers with the port authorities, instead of with the consul
                            of his nation. This contention has been uniformly resisted by the United
                            States, as well as by other governments, on the ground of its
                            inconvenience, its inconsistence with the spirit of international law
                            and with the express or implied stipulations of treaties. Colombia and
                            Venezuela both receded from their position. You will find the
                            correspondence with Colombia published in <ref target="frus1879">Foreign
                                Relations, 1879</ref> and <ref target="frus1880">1880</ref>; that

                            and <ref target="frus1883">1883</ref>.</p>
                        <p>You will observe from Mr. Buchanan’s dispatch that the Government of
                            France is understood to have protested at Rio de Janeiro against the
                            practice of the Brazilian consul general at Buenos Aires.</p>
                        <p>The Department will be glad to have you present its views on this subject
                            to the Government of Brazil, pointing out the inconvenience, if not
                            impropriety, of the course pursued by its officer, which it trusts will
                            be abandoned.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit under
                            separate cover the reports of the minister for foreign affairs and
                            minister of justice and interior presented to His Excellency the
                            President of the Republic on the 14th instant.</p>
                        <p>The report of the minister for foreign affairs treats principally of
                            negotiations with neighboring countries for the delineation and
                            establishment of boundaries. More or less progress has been made in
                            every case, but the most important and interesting have been those with
                            France, which culminated on the 10th ultimo with the acceptance and
                            signing of a treaty of arbitration by which the question of the boundary
                            line is to be submitted to the Government of the Swiss Confederation for
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>The question at issue, which includes the disputed territory of Amapa,
                            arises from different interpretations of article 8 of the treaty of
                            Utrecht, <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0078"/>the Brazilian Government
                            contending that by the River Japac, mentioned by the treaty, the Oyapoc
                            was intended, while the French Government maintains that the Araguary
                            was intended.</p>
                        <p>The arbiter is at liberty to select either of these rivers or any river
                            between the two.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the recent visit of the commission from the National
                            Association of Manufacturers, the report says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>In the report presented by my predecessor on April 30, 1896, it
                                    appears that some of the principal chambers of commerce of the
                                    United States of America had determined to send to Brazil
                                    delegates who, for their enlightenment and that of others,
                                    desired to inform themselves in regard to the resources of this
                                    country and of the proper way of developing the commercial
                                    relations with this country. The Government responded to an
                                    invitation from the American legation that those delegates would
                                    receive all possible aid for the happy and complete success of
                                    their mission, and they did so, returning well satisfied, as
                                    appears from the correspondence which accompanies this report.
                                    (Appendix No. 1.)</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It appears that the British legation has succeeded in arranging here for
                            the acceptance of certificates from the board of trade (British) as
                            satisfactory evidence of the tonnage of British vessels, thus obviating
                            the necessity of other admeasurements. It has occurred to me that some
                            similar arrangement should be made for our vessels, and I will
                            communicate with the consul-general to ascertain the present practice,
                            and if found arduous or burdensome on shipping interests, ask your
                            consideration of the question.</p>
                        <p>Other portions of the report refer to detail matter in which we have no

                            prepared a note, transmitting same, a copy of which I inclose, and
                            yesterday morning went to Rio de Janeiro and placed it in the hands of
                            the minister for foreign affairs, emphasizing, in our personal
                            interview, the fact that it was an expression of the sentiments of our
                            entire Government and people.</p>
                        <p>The minister thanked me, for himself and his Government, very cordially
                            for the friendly and sympathetic message, as well as for the note which
                            I had written him on the subject on the 6th instant, a copy of which I
                            also inclose.</p>
                        <p>I then called personally on the President, and expressed the
                            gratification of my Government—mentioning particularly the President and
                            the Secretary of State—over his fortunate escape and their profound
                            sympathy on account of the assassination of Marshal Bittencourt,
                            informing him that I had placed copy of my telegraphic instructions in
                            the hands of the minister for foreign affairs.</p>
                        <p>The President seemed to be most painfully affected over the situation,
                            especially over the fact that the Marshal’s life was given to save his.
                            He very feelingly received my expressions of congratulation and
                            condolence, and bade me, most heartily, to thank the President, the
                            Secretary of State, and all my people for their kind and friendly
                            expressions in this, the saddest occasion of his life.</p>
                        <p>On my return to Petropolis last night I found your telegram of the 9th
                            instant, and although I had construed the former telegram to include the
                            President, and so expressed myself in my personal interview with
                            President Moraes, yet I thought best to transmit an additional message,
                            which I immediately did by means of the note, a copy of which I
                            inclose.</p>
                        <p>I shall undoubtedy receive, in due time, formal acknowledgments of my
                            notes, and will then forward copies.</p>
                        <p>I should add, that immediately upon receiving the news of the attempted
                            assassination I joined with the members of the diplomatic corps,
                            resident in Petropolis, in sending to the minister for foreign affairs a
                            telegram, copy and translation of which is herewith inclosed. I have,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to confirm my cipher
                            telegram of the 5th instant.</p>
                        <p>About 1 o’clock of the afternoon of November 5 the President was
                            returning from on board the steamer <hi rend="italic">Espirito
                                Santo</hi>, where he had been, accompanied by his cabinet and
                            military and civil staff, to welcome a contingent of officers and troops
                            just returning victorious from the “Canudas war,” and had just landed at
                            the war arsenal, where there had gathered an immense crowd, composed of
                            friends and families of the returning soldiers, and the public
                            generally. As the crowd parted to make room for the Presidential party a
                            young soldier sprang quickly in front of the President and twice snapped
                            a pistol at him. The pistol failing to discharge, he instantly drew a
                            large knife or poignard and was about to plunge it into the President,
                            when Marshal Bittencourt, the minister of war, pushed the President
                            aside, grappled with the soldier, and himself received five serious
                            wounds, from which he died within ten minutes.</p>

                        <p>Col. Luiz Moraes, a nephew of the President and chief of his military
                            staff, in attempting to disarm the soldier and save the minister of war,
                            was seriously but not dangerously wounded.</p>
                        <p>The assassin was a young soldier of the Tenth Infantry by the name of
                            Marcelino Bispo de Mello, who was immediately incarcerated.</p>
                        <p>The same evening the President issued a proclamation “to the nation,” of
                            which I inclose a copy and translation.</p>
                        <p>On the 6th instant the minister of war was interred at the expense of the
                            Government, a large public burial being had and the President
                            accompanying the cortege to the cemetery.</p>

                                premeditated attempt against me, and which sacrificed one of the
                                most devoted servants of the nation, the brave Marshal Carlos
                                Machado Bittencourt, I must affirm in the most solemn manner that
                                this horrible crime will not have the effect of moving me one single
                                line from the obligation of my constitutional mission.</p>
                            <p>The precious blood of a Brazilian marshal, heroically shed in defense
                                of the person of the Chief Magistrate, gives a guaranty that those
                                charged with sustaining public authority and institutions will not
                                hesitate in the discharge of their duty, even when carried to the
                                extreme of sacrifice.</p>
                            <p>The sublime popular indignation manifested in this tragic moment, the
                                unquestionable proofs of support and solidarity given to the
                                President, fortifies me in the conviction that I can depend upon the
                                Brazilian people to sustain, with dignity and courage, the authority
                                with which I am invested by their spontaneous and sovereign
                                will.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 26th instant I received a visit
                            from the under secretary of foreign relations of Chile, Señor Ricardo
                            Phillips, who stated that the claim of the French citizen, Charles
                            Freraut, against Chile, based upon the confiscation of nitrate property
                            and machinery during the war with Peru, had been pending for a number of
                            years, and that the French legation had proposed its arbitration. The
                            Chilean Government, he continued, was disposed to accept this proposal,
                            and as an evidence of respect for the United States and appreciation for
                            myself he desired to know whether I would be willing to act as
                            arbitrator between the two Governments.</p>
                        <p>I replied that the task of an arbitrator was an ungrateful one, and that
                            I had no desire to act in that capacity. At the same time, as a last
                            resort, I should not feel justified in declining if the Governments of
                            France and Chile requested my Government to authorize me to act.</p>
                        <p>I suggested, however, that before deciding upon the arbitration, further
                            effort should be made in order to see whether a direct arrangement
                            between the two Governments might not be practicable.</p>
                        <p>I am since informed that in accordance with my suggestion a definite
                            proposition has been formulated by the Chilean Government which affords
                            a basis of settlement. I therefore hope that the arbitration will not be
                            necessary, and that the Department will not be addressed on the
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>In any case, I have regarded the incident as worthy of mention, as
                            showing the development of good feeling on the part of this Government
                            toward the United States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of the 6th instant, in which you state, under
                            telegraphic advice from your Government, that Mr. Edward H. Strobel, the
                            United States minister to Chile, has been in his private capacity
                            selected as umpire to arbitrate an old French claim against Chile, and,
                            inasmuch as Mr. Strobel is at the present time the diplomatic agent of
                            this country at Santiago, you request that he be authorized to accept
                            the office.</p>
                        <p>The South American mail which reached this Department on the 3d instant
                            brought a dispatch from Mr. Strobel reporting that the under secretary
                            for foreign relations of Chile had sounded him as to his acceptance of
                            the post of arbitrator, if jointly tendered on behalf of Chile and
                            France, and that he had expressed his willingness so to act if the
                            United States Government should approve; but had suggested further
                            efforts for a direct adjustment of the claim which, at the time of
                            writing, had been hopefully reopened.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Strobel’s successor, Mr. Henry L. Wilson, of the State of Washington,
                            was appointed and confirmed on June 9 ultimo to succeed Mr. Strobel, and
                            will shortly set out for his post of duty. As he will thus relieve Mr.
                            Strobel before the announced arbitration can be completed, if not indeed
                            before it can be actually begun, it is necessary to have a distinct
                            understanding in advance that the tender of the office of arbitrator
                            shall be made to and accepted by Mr. Edward H. Strobel in his individual
                            capacity, and is to be carried on to its finality by him in person,
                            without devolving upon his successor in office when he shall be relieved
                            in the near future. Assuming this understanding to be the purpose and
                            wish of the Chilean and French Governments, as your note indicates, I
                            have to-day telegraphed to Mr. Strobel authorizing him to accept the
                            office of arbitrator, if jointly tendered to him, upon the above-stated
                            condition.</p>
                        <p>It affords me much pleasure to acquiesce in this renewed application of
                            the salutary principle of arbitration in settlement of international
                            disputes.</p>

                            <p>For some time past there has been pending for the consideration of
                                the Government of Chile a claim of the French citizen, Charles
                                Freraut, supported by the legation of France.</p>
                            <p>The claimant bases his demand upon the failure to execute a contract
                                concluded on December 28, 1877, by the Government of Peru with
                                Thomas Hart &amp; Co., by whom the contract was assigned to him, the
                                subject of the contract being the nitrate works “Barrenechea,”
                                situated in the province of Tarapaca.</p>
                            <p>In 1882 the ministry of foreign relations transmitted the papers in
                                this claim to the ministry of finance, in order that an opinion
                                might be given by the latter department regarding the proposition
                                presented by Freraut for the settlement of his claim.</p>
                            <p>In the ministry of finance a detailed examination of the claim was
                                made, which resulted in establishing that the claim could not be
                                settled administratively, because there was an adverse decision of
                                the courts based on the provisions of the treaty of Ancon, and that
                                it must be referred to the National Congress for settlement.</p>
                            <p>In 1893 the claimant, in view of the above decision, presented
                                himself to Congress and requested its aid. The committee charged
                                with studying the petition decided that the Government of Chile,
                                through the minister of foreign relations, should be authorized to
                                make a definite arrangement with the claimant, taking as a basis
                                whatever justice and equity there was in the claim, and duly making
                                a report to Congress of the form of settlement.</p>
                            <p>As the different attempts which have been made since that date to
                                reach a direct agreement with the claimant have given no result, the
                                ministry of foreign relations, in order to arrive at some
                                conclusion, has believed it to be its duty to accept arbitration as
                                a means of settlement; and for this purpose, and proceeding in
                                accord with the legation of France, has conferred the office of
                                arbitrator upon Mr. Edward H. Strobel, in his individual character,
                                that he might decide the claim of Freraut in accordance with the
                                protocol signed in this capital on the 3d instant, which is
                                submitted for your approval, and which is accompanied herewith by a
                                duly-certified copy.</p>
                            <p>The responsible character and distinguished antecedents of the person
                                appointed, as well as the elevation and prudence with which he has
                                discharged the representation of the Government of the United States
                                in Chile, have been sufficient reasons to induce the Government of
                                Chile to intrust to Mr. Strobel this delicate mission of
                                confidence.</p>

                            duties in this connection, nor is it desirable that any instructions
                            which may have been given should be too literally followed. Your own
                            judgment and experience, the standing of the firms who seek your
                            assistance and of their agents, must all be given due weight and your
                            action shaped accordingly. Broadly speaking, you should employ all
                            proper methods for the extension of American commercial interests in
                            China, while refraining from advocating the projects of any one firm to
                            the exclusion of others.</p>
                        <p>In this connection it is proper to remark that the Department does not
                            consider it any part of your duty, or of that of the staff of your
                            legation, to devote so much time and labor as you state they do to
                            writing and translating papers for Americans desirous of submitting them
                            to the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>The Department trusts that you will keep it thoroughly advised as to all
                            American enterprises of which you may hear in China, as, with the
                            exception of the dispatch under acknowledgment, it has only received
                            one—No. 2534, of May 25 of this year—bearing upon this most interesting
                            and important subject, and it is not possible to fully understand the
                            scope of the “great plans” of the Americans which you state are now on
                            the eve of becoming assured. The Department would like to know something
                            more of the plans and the individuals connected therewith, if it is
                            practicable for you to send them.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that I had,
                            day before yesterday, an important interview with the Tsung-li Yamên. It
                            has been the practice of the Yamên to delegate one or two ministers to
                            receive the foreign representatives and discuss with them whatever
                            questions were raised.</p>
                        <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0091"/>
                        <p>On this occasion I desired to be received by Prince Kung and Weng
                            Tung-to, who are members of the grand council and the Yamên, as well as
                            by the more distinguished other members of the Yamên.</p>
                        <p>On the occasion of his New Year’s visit I saw Prince Kung and asked him
                            to be present at this interview. He said he would be unable to be there,
                            but asked me to state what my business was. I accordingly briefly told
                            him that I wished the Yamên to wire to Sheng Taotai, the director of
                            railroads, that he must treat the Americans fairly and make a contract
                            with them to build the Hankow-Pekin line of road. I do not now state the
                            entire conversation, because it will appear in full in my report of the
                            interview with the Yamên. The prince promised me that he would wire to
                            Sheng that he must treat the Americans favorably.</p>
                        <p>I found at the Yamên the following ministers: Prince Ching, Weng Tung-ho,
                            Li Hung Chang, Chang Yin-huan, Ching Hsin, and Ure Ting-fen. I stated
                            that I came to see the Yamên to discuss with them certain I questions in
                            which my countrymen were interested; that while I was not authorized by
                            my Government to demand of the Chinese Government contracts to build
                            railroads or to do any other work, yet it was, as I conceived, my duty
                            to see that the rights of my compatriots should be protected as well in
                            the matter of contracts as in other matters; that my Government had not
                            demanded any compensation, direct or indirect, for its services to
                            China, though all the gentlemen present well knew that to the Department
                            of State belonged the honor of having made peace for China; that the
                            services rendered by other powers were made possible only by our
                            proposal of and conducting to a successful termination the adoption of
                            peace negotiations; that other powers had demanded and received rewards
                            for their action; that to one power a large strip of territory on the
                            Mekong was ceded; that to another the right to build railroads in
                            Manchuria was granted; that with another a contract was made to buy
                            ships; that with all three powers advantageous loans were made; that it
                            was conceded by all the officials who had been consulted on railroad
                            questions that Americans could better than any other people build great
                            railroads; that the Government had been distinctly advised on all sides
                            to treat with Americans for building its great lines of railroads; that
                            it had gone out all over the world that contracts would be made with
                            Americans; that from a political point of view it was conceded on all
                            hands that the work of developing China should be conceded to Americans,
                            because the United States had and could have no ulterior designs on
                            Asiatic territory; that to refuse now to grant contracts to Americans
                            might develop a bad feeling among our people at home and make them less
                            friendly than they always had been to China; that a few weeks ago it was
                            understood that the contract for building the Hankow-Pekin line was
                            actually let to Americans—a preliminary contract had been made with the
                            American China Development Company; that this company was composed of
                            men who were worth several hundred millions of taels; that it was beyond
                            all peradventure able to execute any contract it might make; that at the
                            instance of Sheng Taotai and other distinguished persons (meaning Li
                            Hung Chang) well-known experts and financiers had come to Shanghai; that
                            they were there in consultation with Sheng, and they had represented to
                            me that Sheng was not disposed to treat them fairly; that it would be a
                            breach of good faith to fail to make a contract with these
                            representatives of American interests, and I had to demand that they
                            wire to Sheng to contract with the American company for the building of
                            the Hankow-Pekin line; that I did not desire to go into details of the
                            contracts to be made, but would leave them to the parties concerned.</p>
                        <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0092"/>
                        <p>The Yamên replied to me that Sheng had been appointed director-general of
                            railroads and had the sole control of all the questions involved. I said
                            I knew he had been so appointed, but it was idle to say that the
                            Government of China did not control him. It controlled absolutely all
                            its officials. Sheng had been favorable to the Americans, as everybody
                            knew, until he was recently attacked in the English newspapers. He was
                            afraid of their denunciation. His hands must be strengthened. He must be
                            told to pay no attention to newspaper talk and to act in a
                            straightforward, business way.</p>
                        <p>Li Hung Chang said the important question was the rate of interest at
                            which money was to be furnished; that they could get money at 3 per
                            cent. I said that nobody would loan money to China at 3 per cent, and
                            especially to a railroad company, but that the rate of interest depended
                            on the granting of the right of constructing the railroad; that if the
                            contract to build the railroad and furnish the material were granted to
                            Americans the rate of interest could be satisfactorily arranged; that
                            certainly without these conditions nobody could loan money to a railroad
                            company without a government indorsement.</p>
                        <p>Li then said that it must be understood that there must be no concession,
                            meaning no ownership by a foreign company of the railroad. I said it was
                            understood that the railroad would not become the property of any
                            foreign company, but that, of course, proper measures would be taken to
                            secure any loan that was made.</p>
                        <p>There were frequent interruptions of this conversation by Weng Tung-ho,
                            Prince Ching, Chang Yin-huan, and Li Hung Chang. It was finally
                            understood that the Yamên was to report the substance of this interview
                            to Sheng and was to recommend that he come to terms with the American
                            company, and I was to advise the company to be conciliatory and
                            liberal.</p>
                        <p>As my instructions on the question of assisting my fellow-citizens in
                            industrial enterprises are somewhat strict, I beg to say that I did not
                            conceive that I exceeded their fair scope in taking the action above set
                            out. I have not felt authorized to demand, as a compensation for any
                            services rendered by the Department of State, any concessions. On the
                            other hand, I have found myself unable to maintain absolute silence,
                            which would be construed into indifference. I have not participated in
                            the actual making of contracts, though, as an old lawyer, I have
                            confidentially advised applicants as to the measures to be adopted; but
                            when a preliminary contract is made I believe it to be my duty to insist
                            on the rights of my fellow-citizens. The Department approved my conduct
                            in the matter of securing to the Baldwin Locomotive Works a contract to
                            which it was fairly entitled, and I hope it will approve my conduct as
                            above set out.</p>
                        <p>There are at Shanghai several Americans engaged in discussing with Sheng
                            the terms of a contract for building railroads. Among them are
                            ex-Senator Washburn, Messrs. Whitney, Cary, Bash, Dodd, Rich, and
                            Kennedy. Senator Washburn came to China at the instance of Li Hung Chang
                            and so wired Li asking his assistance, and Li answered that he could do
                            nothing, as the matter was left to Sheng. I made Li understand that I
                            knew of this incident and he felt his responsibility and was
                            comparatively quiet.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the interview herein reported will exercise a beneficial
                            influence on American interests in China, and venture to hope that you
                            will not conceive that I have exceeded my instructions.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your dispatch No. 1376, of December 19 last, wherein you set
                            forth certain instructions relative to the promotion of American
                            enterprises in China. In this connection I beg to refer to my dispatch
                            No. 2671, of January 10 last, wherein I report an account of an
                            interview with the Tsung-li Yamên. It will appear therefrom, I think,
                            that I correctly apprehended your previous instructions.</p>
                        <p>Divers Americans have visited China with the purpose of constructing
                            railroads, establishing banks, and developing mines. None have made any
                            long stay, nor any persistent effort, except the American-China
                            Development Company, which was represented by Mr. A. W. Bash. This
                            gentleman remained here more than a year and energetically labored to
                            secure contracts for building railroads, and he was rendered all
                            possible assistance by this legation. Recently his attention was more
                            particularly directed to securing the contract to construct the line
                            from Hankow to Pekin. On the 1st of November last he made a preliminary
                            contract with Sheng Taotai, who is director-general of railroads. Mr.
                            Bash was not authorized by his company to conclude a contract, so the
                            final making thereof was laid over until the arrival at Shanghai of a
                            committee of the American-China Development Company. Messrs. W. D.
                            Washburn, Clarence Cary, and others constituted such committee. They
                            arrived at Shanghai on December 28 last, and proceeded to negotiate with
                            Sheng Taotai.</p>
                        <p>At the time I wrote the dispatch No. 2632, of November 5, to which your
                            dispatch No. 1376 is an answer, I had strong grounds to hope—having seen
                            the preliminary contract—that the American syndicate would succeed in
                            making a contract with Sheng which would give complete control over
                            national progress in China. The latest advices that I have received
                            leave the question of securing a contract to build the Pekin-Hankow line
                            in doubt, but it appears that several American engineers have been
                            employed, and there is no doubt that considerable material will be
                            furnished by American manufacturers.</p>

                            2671, of January 10 last, reporting an interview had by you with the
                            Yamên on the subject of railroads in China, whereat you urged upon them
                            the making of contracts with Americans to build the Hankow-Pekin line of
                            road.</p>
                        <p>The Department commends the interest you take in the advancement of
                            American enterprises in China and the efforts made by you in their
                            behalf with the Chinese foreign office, but you should be cautious in
                            giving what might be understood as this Government’s indorsement of the
                            financial standing of the persons seeking contracts with that of China.
                            In the present case it appears from your dispatch that you <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0094"/>told the Tsung-li Yamên that the
                            American-China Development Company “was composed of men who were worth
                            several hundred millions of taels.” The Department understands that the
                            said company is a limited liability company, with a very small capital.
                            The individual financial standing of the various persons composing the
                            company has, consequently, little to do with the matter.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In your dispatch No: 1368,<note n="1" xml:id="d64fn1">See <ref target="frus1896#pg_67">Foreign Relations,
                                    1896, p. 67</ref>.</note> of November 25 last, you inclose a
                            draft of a communication relating to antiforeign riots, and embodying
                            suggestions as to steps to be taken for the prevention of their
                            recurrence.</p>
                        <p>This paper was duly presented to the Yamên, and I have now the honor to
                            inclose a translation of the Yamên’s answer thereto.</p>
                        <p>As the inauguration of this discussion originated with the Department, I
                            deem it proper to submit the answer to the draft above mentioned to you
                            before replying thereto. I beg to observe, however, that the inclosure
                            bears signs of having been hastily prepared, perhaps owing to the fact
                            that it was written during the vacation incidental to the Chinese New
                            Year, when business is mostly suspended.</p>
                        <p>I observe, also, that the gravity of the subject-matter may be more
                            strongly enforced by a personal interview than in written
                            correspondence, and that I contemplate having an oral discussion with
                            the Yamên before a final result is reached. In the Department’s draft
                            the first demand is: “Recognition by the issuance of a formal
                            declaration in an Imperial decree that American missionaries have the
                            right to reside in the interior of China.”</p>
                        <p>The Yamên answers that this right is provided for by treaty, and mentions
                            that various decrees recognizing it have been issued. This is a valuable
                            admission, as treaties, except the Berthemy convention, are silent on
                            the question of residence in the interior.</p>
                        <p>A direct and positive recognition of this right, however, made in
                            connection with a statement as to the measure to be taken to prevent
                            riots, would be valuable, and, indeed, necessary for the complete
                            apprehension of any decree relating to the subject. As to the second
                            point, the right of American missionaries to buy land in the interior,
                            the Yamên simply states that “American missionaries should be treated in
                            this matter the same as the French missionaries.”</p>
                        <p>Here again the desired purpose is not accomplished. What is wanted is not
                            a recognition of this right by the Tsung-li Yamên in a communication
                            addressed to this legation, but an open and notorious publication in an
                            Imperial decree that the right exists, and the communication thereof
                            authoritatively to all the local officials all over China.</p>
                        <p>Such action would probable prevent the ever-recurring troubles which
                            confront our missionaries in their efforts to secure land for stations
                            in the interior.</p>
                        <p>The third suggestion of the Department goes to the responsibility of <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0095"/>the higher officials in the
                            localities in which riots occur for the acts or omissions of their
                            subordinates. The Yamên does not seem to have apprehended the point of
                            this specification.</p>
                        <p>The Yamên concedes that if the local officials “do not take precautionary
                            measures to prevent trouble * * *” they should be punished 5 but it does
                            reply to the suggestion, which is the gist of the paragraph, that “the
                            viceroy or governor of the province in which it (a riot) has occurred,
                            who is directly responsible to the Throne for the acts and omissions of
                            every one of his subordinates, although his only fault may be
                            ignorance,” should be held responsible for the acts or omissions of his
                            subordinates.</p>
                        <p>This paragraph embodies the most important suggestion in the Department’s
                            paper.</p>
                        <p>The whole discussion leads up to the idea expressed specifically on page
                            4 of that paper, to the effect that “the main remedy for existing evils
                            and the surest prevention of riots will be holding of the local
                            officials to a personal accountability for every outrage against
                            foreigners that may occur in their jurisdiction.”</p>
                        <p>What is wanted is an Imperial decree embodying this idea. Paragraph 4 of
                            the Department’s specifications goes to the proposition that officials
                            found guilty of negligence or connivance with rioters should be
                            punished, in addition to suffering degradation or deprivation of
                            office.</p>
                        <p>The Yamên does not see its way clear to carry out the Department’s
                            suggestions. It is conceded that the question of the punishment of
                            officials, who are practically supreme in their provinces, for
                            negligence is difficult of solution, but no difficulty is found in
                            awarding suitable punishment for crimes committed against the Throne,
                            and, if possible, China must be made to learn that the murder of
                            foreigners and the destruction of their property are “offenses of a very
                            grave nature.”</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: On the 11th of February
                                instant the princes and ministers had the honor to receive a
                                communication from the United States minister, wherein he states
                                that on the 21st day of September last he had the honor, by
                                direction of his Government, to address the Yamên a communication to
                                the effect that his Government was carefully considering the subject
                                of antiforeign riots in China, with the view to present to the Yamên
                                thereafter another communication embodying its views on the measures
                                that it is desired to see adopted in order to prevent the recurrence
                                of these lamentable outrages on foreign residents in China. Your
                                excellency further states that the best means to prevent the
                                recurrence of antiforeign riots in China would be to adopt certain
                                measures, so that the good relations existing between the two
                                countries maybe confirmed and strengthened.</p>
                            <p>On receiving your excellency’s communication of the 21st of September
                                the Yamên replied that it is only necessary that both Chinese and
                                foreigners should be commanded to observe the treaties, and if the
                                plan decided upon is not in contravention to treaty stipulations,
                                China will certainly come to a suitable decision.</p>
                            <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0096"/>
                            <p>From the tenor of your excellency’s communication the local officials
                                should be held responsible when outrages against foreigners occur in
                                their jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency proposes the following measures:</p>
                            <p>First. Recognition by the issuance of a formal declaration in an
                                Imperial decree that American missionaries have the right to reside
                                in the interior of China. It may be observed that this right is
                                provided for by treaty. Imperial decrees have already been issued
                                commanding that due protection should be given to United States
                                citizens residing in China.</p>
                            <p>It is the duty of China to adopt every means to give proper
                                protection to Americans living in China, as pointed out by your
                                excellency. It is therefore not necessary to dwell at length on that
                                point.</p>
                            <p>Second. Your excellency states that the declaration in such decree
                                should be that American missionaries have the right to buy land in
                                the interior of China; that they have all the privileges of the
                                Berthemy convention, and that deeds taken by them shall be in the
                                name of the missionary society or church which buys the land, as
                                that convention provides.”</p>
                            <p>The princes and ministers beg to state that while the treaties
                                between the United States and China do not provide for this, still
                                the American missionaries should be treated in this matter the same
                                as the French missionaries.</p>
                            <p>Third. The determination of and formal declaration by China by
                                Imperial decree to’ hold responsible and properly punish not only
                                all individuals or minor officials directly or remotely involved
                                upon the occurrence of any riot whereby peaceable American citizens
                                have been affected in person or property or injured in their
                                established rights, but also the viceroy or governor of the province
                                in which it has occurred, etc.</p>
                            <p>It may be observed that all cases of outrages against missionaries
                                and their property are the acts of bad characters. Take, for
                                instance, the riots in Szechuan and Kutien. These were caused by
                                outlaws, a fact duly supported by evidence. The local authorities
                                are charged with the duties of looking after the people and seeing
                                that tranquillity prevails within their jurisdiction. If they do not
                                take precautionary measures to prevent trouble, or after trouble has
                                arisen if they fail to act properly, they are guilty of an offense
                                and should be punished.</p>
                            <p>The viceroys and governors are responsible for the provinces, and if
                                the local authorities fail to do their duty they can not repudiate
                                the charge intrusted to them.</p>
                            <p>Fourth. That the punishment of officials found guilty of negligence
                                in case of a riot, or of connivance with rioters, shall not simply
                                be degradation from or deprivation of office, but that they shall
                                be, in addition, rendered forever incapable of holding office, and
                                shall also be punished by death, imprisonment, confiscation of
                                property, banishment, or in some other manner under the laws of
                                China in proportion to the enormity of their offense.</p>
                            <p>To this the princes and ministers would observe that as to the
                                punishment inflicted on delinquent officials—those who fail to meet
                                their liabilities to the Government—have their property confiscated
                                by order of the Emperor. Other offenses, such as officials taking
                                bribes or violating the statutes, are merely punished by deprivation
                                of office.</p>
                            <p>The punishment of “forever holding office again” is inflicted only
                                for offenses of a very grave nature. The punishment by death,
                                banishment, or imprisonment for the above offenses is not provided
                                for by the penal code. If such severe punishment were to be
                                inflicted on officials <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0097"/>who
                                have failed to deal properly with, missionary cases, it is feared
                                that the people would treat them with contempt; besides, outlaws who
                                entertain a grudge against local officials might some day say that
                                the officials who have punished us are now in turn being punished
                                themselves. Should this feeling of contempt increase serious
                                complications might arise. The princes and ministers, therefore, do
                                not see their way clear to carry out the above suggestions.</p>
                            <p>Fifth. Your excellency suggests that the Imperial decree embodying
                                the above provision shall be prominently put up and displayed in
                                every Yamên in China.</p>
                            <p>To this the princes and ministers would state that during the past
                                few years the Yamên has frequently instructed the high officials in
                                the provinces to act as already decreed by the Emperor, and it does
                                not seem necessary to discuss this point.</p>
                            <p>In a word: Whenever missionary cases have occurred of recent years
                                the Yamên has always taken action in good earnest. Everything has
                                been done in cases that have not interfered with the internal
                                administration of China, or have not been in violation of treaty
                                stipulations.</p>
                            <p>The friendly relations existing between the United States and China
                                have always been staunch and firm. The princes and ministers believe
                                that the minister of the United States will be considerate in this
                                matter, and hope he will send a copy of this communication for the
                                information of the honorable Secretary of State.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch No. 2707,<note n="1" xml:id="d65fn1">Not printed.</note> of the 11th instant, I inclosed
                            a copy of a paper sent by me to the Tsung-li Yamên, embodying the
                            renewal of the demand heretofore made, that cognizance should be taken
                            of the conduct of certain officials relative to the antiforeign riots
                            which occurred at Kutien in August, 1895. I have now the honor to
                            inclose a translation of a communication from the Yamên of the 26th
                            instant in reply to the above-mentioned paper.</p>
                        <p>As is usual in Chinese state papers, the Yamên recapitulates the
                            substance of my communication. It then proceeds to observe that the
                            questions at issue concern both the British Government and our own; that
                            on the 22d of November, 1895, the viceroy at Foochow reported to the
                            Throne that the case had been settled on terms stated, involving the
                            decapitation of twenty and more persons, the punishment in other modes
                            of twenty and more others, and the degradation of three officials.</p>
                        <p>The Yamên proceeds to observe that the calamity which befell the English
                            missionaries was severe, and that we suffered very little, but,
                            nevertheless, the British representative made no objection to the
                            settlement of the case. It claims that justice has been
                            administered.</p>
                        <p>The action of the United States in the Rockspring case is adverted to by
                            way of comparison.</p>
                        <p>It is objected to holding the local officials responsible; that in all
                            cases it is first necessary to ascertain who is guilty, and that unless
                            officers have tailed to do their duty they should not be punished when a
                            riot occurs.</p>
                        <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0098"/>
                        <p>The Yamên observes that offenders against foreigners are more severely
                            punished than in purely Chinese cases.</p>
                        <p>The Yamên repeats that it is difficult now to punish the officials
                            mentioned.</p>
                        <p>From this summary of the Yamên’s communication it is apparent that
                            considerable stress is placed on the fact that the British Government
                            has contented itself with the action taken by the Chinese Government,
                            although its subjects were almost the only sufferers. From reports that
                            have reached me, it appears that in the locality in which the massacre
                            occurred there has been a great Christian revival, which is ascribed to
                            the forbearance of Great Britain in not insisting on severer treatment
                            of the case, and in not demanding damages. This circumstance, taken in
                            connection with the length of time that has elapsed since the riot
                            occurred, and the great difficulty under the Chinese system of
                            government of opening up a matter which has been reported to the Throne
                            as settled, induces me to suggest that you reconsider the original
                            purpose to press for specific action against the accused officials as a
                            separate and distinct contention.</p>
                        <p>It is more important for us now to devise and put in force safe and
                            efficient means to prevent future riots than it is to secure the
                            punishment of officials who may have been negligent in the past.</p>
                        <p>We have pending a discussion with the Yamên on the means to be adopted by
                            China to prevent antiforeign riots. (See Department’s dispatch No. 1368,
                            of November 25, 1898, for the draft of our demands.)</p>
                        <p>I most respectfully submit for your consideration that the proposition to
                            secure the adoption of general preventive measures applicable to the
                            future, and the proposition to punish the Kutien officials might be
                            blended together in a discussion with the Yamên, and that I might be
                            authorized to accept as a final settlement the putting in execution of
                            the measures set out in the dispatch cited, or other measures analogous
                            thereto.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: On the 11th instant the
                                princes and ministers had the honor to receive a communication from
                                the minister of the United States stating that on the 23d of
                                November last he brought to the attention of the Yamên a demand on
                                the part of his Government that cognizance should be taken of the
                                conduct of certain officials, relating to the antiforeign riots
                                which occurred at Kutien, and that proper and suitable punishment be
                                decreed against them; that the princes and ministers sent an answer
                                to the above communication, wherein they stated that the viceroy at
                                Foochow had reported that twenty and more of the offenders had
                                suffered the death penalty by decapitation, and twenty and more
                                other offenders, whose offenses were not of so grave a character,
                                had also been punished; some to banishment to the frontier military
                                posts and others to imprisonment for life in the jails of various
                                magistrates; that Tang Yao-te, Wang Yu-lin, Wang Yu-yung, mentioned
                                in Commander Newell’s report, had been degraded; that a year had
                                elapsed since the case was settled and that “it is not convenient
                                now to pursue the matter any further;” that in regard to <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0099"/>the claim of Miss Hartford he had
                                received information that it had been paid, and for the promptness
                                in discharging this liability he returned thanks.</p>
                            <p>The minister of the United States further stated that he transmitted
                                to the honorable Secretary of State a translation of the Yamên’s
                                previous communication and had received from him instructions to
                                insist by all proper methods on the punishment of the officials
                                mentioned in Commander Newell’s report; that it is not too late to
                                investigate the conduct of the delinquent officials and to punish
                                them for their connivance or negligence; that he could not too often
                                repeat that the only way to prevent the recurrence of antiforeign
                                riots in China is to hold the officials responsible for acts of
                                violence perpetrated in their respective jurisdictions, and what he
                                asks is simply to treat with the same rigor crimes against
                                foreigners as crimes against Chinese subjects are treated—a question
                                under the treaties foreigners have the right to demand it, etc.</p>
                            <p>In reply, the princes and ministers beg to observe that the case in
                                question concerns both the American and British Governments. On the
                                22d of November, 1895, a memorial from the viceroy at Fuchau was
                                received and presented to His Majesty the Emperor, stating that the
                                Kutien case had been settled, that twenty and more of the chief
                                offenders had suffered the death penalty by decapitation, and twenty
                                and more other offenders had been banished to the frontier military
                                posts and imprisoned for life in the jails of various magistrates,
                                and that Tang Yao-te, Wang Yu-lin, and Wang Yu-yung, mentioned in
                                Commander Newell’s report as being guilty of culpable neglect in the
                                discharge of their duty as local officials, have been denounced to
                                the Throne and degraded.</p>
                            <p>In viewing the circumstances connected with this case it may be
                                observed that the calamity which had befallen the English
                                missionaries was of a most violent nature. The Americans suffered a
                                very little.</p>
                            <p>After the memorial had been presented to the Throne announcing that
                                the case had been settled, the British charge d’affaires had no
                                objection to make. The case had been decided justly, and based upon
                                the true facts a proper punishment has been inflicted upon the
                                guilty. It is apparent throughout the whole case that no injustice
                                has been done or leniency shown. The honorable Secretary of State
                                insists that other officials mentioned by Commander Newell should be
                                punished for their neglect of duty. To this the princes and
                                ministers would beg to observe that as China has dealt fairly and
                                justly with the case in question she can not take further severe
                                action as requested.</p>
                            <p>It may be further observed that China has dealt with this case in a
                                more severe manner than the United States did in Rockspring and Huai
                                Hua-yuan cases. When these cases were settled there is ample
                                evidence to show that no local officer was punished. There is
                                decidedly a great difference in the manner in which these cases were
                                dealt with.</p>
                            <p>As to the remark that in order to prevent riots against foreigners
                                the only way is to hold the local authorities responsible, to this
                                remark it may be stated that it is necessary to first ascertain who
                                is guilty of neglect of duty. If the local officer is found to have
                                been negligent in the discharge of his duty he should be punished,
                                but in the case of an officer who has not failed to do his duty, and
                                if he is to be punished, when a riot occurs who is to suppress the
                                people and offer protection to the missionaries?</p>
                            <p>If severe punishment is to be inflicted on worthy officers who
                                perform their duties properly, then, in that case, loafers and bad
                                characters would <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0100"/>cause more
                                trouble and defy the local authorities. This is very much to be
                                feared.</p>
                            <p>As to the question that under the treaties foreigners have the right
                                to demand the same treatment as Chinese, it may be observed that it
                                is well known among the officials and people of the provinces that
                                when crimes are committed against foreigners by Chinese the
                                offenders are more severely dealt with than in purely Chinese
                                cases.</p>
                            <p>In this case the Chinese offenders have been dealt with in this way;
                                no favor has been shown.</p>
                            <p>The request made that punishment should be inflicted on the other
                                officials mentioned is one which the princes and ministers find
                                difficult to comply with. They beg that the minister of the United
                                States will transmit this communication for the information of the
                                honorable Secretary of State.</p>

                            No. 2722, of March 24 last, with which you inclose the reply made by the
                            Tsung-li Yamên refusing to comply with your renewed demand for the
                            punishment of the delinquent officials concerned in the Kutien riots in
                            August, 1895, and in which you suggest that the matter, as a separate
                            and distinct contention, be dropped, and that it be blended together
                            with the proposition to secure the adoption of general preventive
                            measures applicable to the future.</p>
                        <p>In furtherance of the policy outlined in the Department’s No. 1312 of
                            July 28, 1896, concerning the prevention of antiforeign riots, it was
                            the duty of this Government to insist, in every case, on the punishment
                            of all officials found guilty in any degree in connection with such
                            occurrences. The failure of Great Britain to act on the same lines in
                            the Kutien case, to which the Yamên refers, made it only the more
                            necessary for the United States, even though their people and interests
                            had suffered but little in that riot, to clearly indicate that this
                            policy was to be urged on China whenever a riot happened. This was done
                            not only in the Kutien, but in the Kiang Yin case as well. However, in
                            view of your suggestion and the arguments in support thereof, and <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0101"/>considering that the discussion
                            with the Yamên of the general question of antiforeign riots is now open,
                            you are instructed not to press, for the present, for the punishment of
                            the Fukien officials implicated in the Kutien affair unless you fail to
                            obtain the Chinese Government’s approval of the propositions embodied in
                            your note to the Yamên (a draft of which was inclosed in the
                            Department’s No. 1368 of November 25, 1896), and the promulgation by
                            official decrees of the measures therein proposed, or analogous ones, by

                            21st September, 1896, I had the honor to address to you a communication,
                            wherein I informed you that my Government proposed to make to you
                            certain representations touching the prevention of the recurrence of
                            anti-foreign riots in China.</p>
                        <p>On the 24th of September, 1896, you answered as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Yamên appreciates very much indeed the idea of the honorable
                                    Secretary of State devising a plan which may prove beneficial to
                                    both countries, and if the plan decided upon is not in
                                    contravention to treaty stipulations China will certainly in a
                                    spirit of friendliness come to a suitable decision.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Continuing this correspondence, I sent to you on the 11th February, 1897,
                            an elaborate paper, which had been prepared by the honorable Secretary
                            of State and approved by him, wherein the question of the plan for
                            preventing antiforeign riots was discussed. In that paper five prominent
                            points were enumerated as demanding action at your hands, which may be
                            briefly summarized as follows: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>Formal recognition of the fact that American missionaries have

                                <item>The determination of China to hold her officials, including
                                    viceroys and governors, responsible for outrages on
                                    foreigners.</item>

                                <label>(5)</label>
                                <item>The posting of an Imperial decree embodying these provisions
                                    in every Yamên in China.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>On the 19th February, 1897, you answered the above mentioned paper
                            substantially as follows:</p>
                        <p>As to the first point you admitted that the right to reside in the
                            interior existed by treaty, and you deemed it useless to issue any
                            formal decree.</p>
                        <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0102"/>
                        <p>As to the second point, you conceded that the American missionaries
                            should be treated like the French missionaries.</p>
                        <p>As to the third point, you conceded that the local authorities should be
                            punished for not taking precautionary measures to prevent riots, but you
                            did not concede in treating this and the next point that governors and
                            viceroys should be punished when antiforeign riots occur in their
                            jurisdictions.</p>
                        <p>You argue that if “severe punishment were to be inflicted on officials
                            who have failed to deal properly with missionary cases, it is feared
                            that the people would treat them with contempt,” and you declined to
                            carry out the suggestions presented to you.</p>
                        <p>In this connection it is proper to refer to the demand made by me
                            November 23, 1896, that certain delinquent officials who failed to do
                            their duty in the matter of the Kutien riots, which took place August 1,
                            1895, should be punished.</p>
                        <p>Acting under the instructions of my Government, I demanded that suitable
                            punishment should be awarded to those officials.</p>
                        <p>On the 29th November, 1896, you replied that “it is not convenient now to
                            pursue the matter any further.”</p>
                        <p>Thus curtly and cavalierly you disposed of the demand made by my
                            Government. In spite of this inconsiderate treatment, I am disposed to
                            consider the question of foreign riots as one chiefly relating to the
                            future, and if I can secure at your hands a proper treatment of the
                            matter of prevention of antiforeign riots, I might consent to drop ‘the
                            consideration of the punishment of officials who have been heretofore
                            delinquent, else I shall be compelled to keep the question open, subject
                            to such action as international occurrences may require.</p>
                        <p>What I desire China to do is to make antiforeign riots impossible. Her
                            character, credit, and standing before the world greatly depends on her
                            action in this regard. She no longer occupies a position of seclusion.
                            She has gone into the markets of the world as a borrower. She has
                            undertaken great works of internal improvement. It is a new China which
                            is appearing to the gaze of mankind, and she is to all intents and
                            purposes a member of the family of nations. Yet day by day riots occur.
                            Every newspaper contains an account of outrages perpetrated on
                            foreigners.</p>
                        <p>On the silliest of pretexts whole, communities are thrown into terror,
                            and ships of war are summoned to be ready to protect the foreigners
                            against rioters.</p>
                        <p>As a friend of China, as well as a representative of some of these
                            foreigners, I am looking around for remedial and preventive action that
                            may secure peace and tranquillity. It is worth your while to join
                            seriously in this discussion, because ultimately your Government suffers
                            in loss of character, influence, public respect, as well pecuniarily, by
                            riots. You can no longer, as in the past, regard the opinion of the
                            world as valueless. Your financial credit is at stake. Why, then, will
                            you not do the simple things I ask you to do? Why will you not hold your
                            viceroys and governors responsible for outrages on foreigners as you
                            hold them responsible for outrages on Chinese subjects? Why will you not
                            procure an Imperial decree to be issued stating the simple determination
                            to hold viceroys, governors, and all officials responsible for riots and
                            denouncing suitable punishment against all officials in whose
                            jurisdiction riots occur?</p>
                        <p>Such a decree would put an end to the occurrence of antiforeign riots in
                            China. It would show that you are in earnest in your desire to prevent
                            riots. You have tried for many years the old policy of paying <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0103"/>damages and cutting off the heads of a
                            few coolies. Riots have increased instead of diminishing. The people
                            care nothing for the payment of damages, and little for the executions
                            of the coolies. The people do not believe that the local officials are
                            in earnest in reprobating riots, and many foreigners are of the same
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>The season of riots, the summer time, is on us. The time to act is
                            now.</p>
                        <p>A ringing, earnest proclamation sent to every Yamên in China that not
                            only degradation from office, but condign punishment will be awarded to
                            every official, high and low, in whose jurisdiction an anti-foreign riot
                            shall occur, would be hailed by the world with joy, and would insure
                            peace, and would save you in future annoyances and loss.</p>
                        <p>Not neglecting the other points made, this is the chief of all. You have
                            your opportunity and your warning. I have had long experience in China.
                            I have seen the terrible evils of riots. I have seen murders, arsons,
                            and the driving of scores of innocent people from their homes while
                            infuriated men chased them like rats. I have seen men lose their health
                            and women made crazy by the perils and sufferings put upon them by mobs.
                            For China and for humanity I am anxious to do something to stop these
                            ever-recurring outrages. The stroke of a pen can accomplish it to the
                            honor and glory of China, and to the injury of no human being. Your
                            viceroys and your governors have the undoubted power to prevent riots,
                            if only His Majesty the Emporer will make them understand that their
                            lives will pay the forfeit of their negligence.</p>

                            dispatch from the consul-general wherein he brings to my attention a
                            proclamation issued at Soochow forbidding Chinese to sell land to
                            foreigners outside of the concession; also, the fact that the Chinese
                            authorities at the open port of Hangchow oppose foreigners residing in
                            the native city of Hang-chow for purposes of trade.</p>
                        <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0104"/>
                        <p>I inclose also a copy of my answer to the consul-general, which will

                            the area of likin exemption as affecting Fuchau is discussed. As no
                            specific case affecting Americans has arisen at Soochow, I have deemed
                            it best to direct the consul-general to send a protest to the Chinese
                            authorities at that port against the proclamation mentioned. The whole
                            question will have to be taken up at Peking by the diplomatic body, or
                            as many of the members thereof as will act in concert, but as nearly all
                            the ministers are now residing at the hills near Peking it will be
                            difficult to procure any action until the autumn.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that
                                the Chinese authorities at the port of Soochow have issued a
                                proclamation forbidding Chinese to sell land to foreigners outside
                                of the concession, and that the Chinese authorities at the open port
                                of Hangchow oppose foreigners residing in the native city of
                                Hangchow for purposes of trade. The positions taken by the Chinese
                                authorities at Soochow and Hangchow are thought to be untenable by
                                many of the consuls-general here, and when approached by the Chinese
                                on the subject I have answered that I would refer the matter to you.
                                I understand that the other consuls-general have submitted, or will
                                submit, the question to their respective ministers. It occurs to me
                                that if the port is an open port a foreigner ought to reside and
                                trade anywhere he wishes within the boundary of the port, as well as
                                have the right to own property within such limits.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am in receipt of your dispatch No.
                                357, of the 17th instant, wherein you inform me that the Chinese
                                authorities at the open port of Soochow have issued a proclamation
                                forbidding Chinese to sell land to foreigners outside of the
                                concession, and that the Chinese authorities at the open port of
                                Hangchow oppose foreigners residing in the native city of Hangchow
                                for purposes of trade. This latter question was brought to your
                                attention in my dispatch No. 556, of July 12.</p>
                            <p>The question of port area and of exemption from likin dues has
                                already arisen at Foochow, as you are aware, and I have addressed
                                the Yamên in the sense that the city of Foochow is within the area
                                of likin exemption.</p>
                            <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0105"/>
                            <p>The questions submitted by you are analogous to the Fuchau question,
                                and they will all have to be taken up and settled by the diplomatic
                                body at Peking.</p>
                            <p>The contention that these questions are settled by the Chefoo
                                convention is untenable.</p>
                            <p>Clauses 1 and 2 of section 3 of that convention are not in force.</p>
                            <p>There is no specific case affecting Americans, except the one at
                                Hang-chow, on which I await your report now pending.</p>
                            <p>You can not well take up the discussion of the right of an American
                                to buy land in the city of Soochow, but outside of the concession,
                                until an actual case shall arise, but you are instructed as a matter
                                of precaution to protest against the proclamation mentioned, and to
                                claim in general that the city of Soochow and the settlements are
                                all in the area of the port and are all opened to foreign trade, and
                                that land can be bought by foreigners in the city under the
                                treaties.</p>
                            <p>As this question affects all nationalities alike, it would be well to
                                consult with your colleagues and secure, if possible, unanimous
                                action.</p>
                            <p>I understand from the British minister that the English consul at
                                Soochow has already referred the question to Sir N. J. Hannen. You
                                will please send to me a copy of the proclamation mentioned and a
                                copy of your protest against it.</p>

                                358, of the 19th instant, wherein you make some observations
                                touching the rights of foreigners at Hangchow and Soochow.</p>
                            <p>As to the ports mentioned, we derive our rights under the

                            <p>The contention of the foreigner has always been that under analogous
                                treaty stipulations the towns and cities named, respectively, were
                                opened to trade and residence, although this result has not always
                                happened, owing to the establishment of settlements near certain
                                cities and the gradual abandonment of the cities as places of
                                residence. This has occurred at Fuchau, and practically wherever
                                there is a concession. For this treaty see Chronicle and Directory,
                                1897, page 105.</p>
                            <p>We will now look at the treaty of commerce and navigation made with
                                Japan July 21, 1896, page 359, same book.</p>
                            <p>Article IV of that treaty reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>Japanese subjects may, with their families, employés, and
                                        servants, frequent, reside, and carry on trade, industries,
                                        and manufactures, or pursue any other lawful avocations in
                                        all the ports, cities, and towns of China which are now or
                                        may hereafter be opened to foreign residence and trade. They
                                        are at liberty to proceed to or from any of the open ports
                                        with their merchandise and effects and within the localities
                                        at those places which have already or may hereafter be set
                                        apart for the use and occupation of foreigners. They are
                                        allowed to rent or purchase houses, rent or lease lands, and
                                        to build churches, cemeteries, and hospitals, enjoying in
                                        all respects the same privileges and immunities as are now
                                        or may hereafter be granted to the subjects or citizens of
                                        the most-favored nation.</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>I understand that it is under this last clause that China claims that
                                the right to buy land is restricted “within the localities at those
                                places which have already or may hereafter be set apart for the use
                                and occupation of foreigners,” and the right to rent and build,
                                etc., is also confined to such localities.</p>
                            <p>The first and last clauses of the Article IV cited are not
                                inconsistent or repugnant. The former grants the rights of residence
                                in all the towns and cities that are opened, with the broadest right
                                of trade, etc., and the latter grants the same rights to the
                                localities especially set apart to foreigners.</p>
                            <p>There is no language in the last clause qualifying the former
                                clause.</p>
                            <p>How can a person reside and carry on business in a place in China
                                unless he can either buy or rent a house? All the treaties granted
                                the right of residence and of renting and buying land in the ports
                                opened to foreign commerce. (See Art. XII, treaty of 1858, United
                                States with China.)</p>
                            <p>It seems to me, therefore, that we must take the ground that the
                                second paragraph of Article IV is simply cumulative.</p>
                            <p>As the rights accruing from what is called a “concession” had not
                                been specifically stated, the last clause, defining such rights, was
                                added.</p>
                            <p>On the general question of foreign right of residence in cities
                                opened to trade, it may be said that to-day foreigners reside and do
                                business in the native cities of Chungking, Ichang, Chinkiang, Wuhu,
                                Kiukiang, and Peking, though it is not technically open to foreign
                                trade.</p>
                            <p>For various reasons it will take some time to settle these questions.
                                In order that we might not appear to waive any right, I deem it best
                                to instruct you to protest against the Soochow proclamation.</p>
                            <p>In the matter of the residence of the insurance agent at Hangchow, I
                                must insist that he has the right to reside in the city. I hope,
                                however, that he will be prudent and that he will avoid any occasion
                                for a riot.</p>

                            <p>I have informed the Yamên that I will not consent to the expulsion of
                                the American from Hangchow, and that the question will be submitted
                                to my Government as soon as I can learn the grounds on which it
                                claims the right to exclude foreigners from Hangchow.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose a translation
                            of a dispatch received from the Tsung-li Yamên on the question of the
                            right of an American citizen to reside at the city of Hangchow. I
                            inclose also a copy of my dispatch in answer thereto.</p>
                        <p>I have treated this question in several dispatches to you, being Nos.
                            2785, of the 28th of July, and 2787, of the 31st of July, to which
                            reference is made.</p>
                        <p>Extended argument on this question is not necessary. The treaty of
                            Shimonoseki, which will be found in the Chronicle and Directory of 1897
                            at page 107, confers the right of residence in the city of Hangchow. The
                            commercial treaty between Japan and China, which will be found at page
                            359 of the same book, confers the same right. Article IV of that treaty
                            distinctly confers that right, and the latter clause thereof grants the
                            same right in the localities which may be set apart for the use and
                            occupation of foreigners. I regard this latter clause as simply
                            cumulative. All the old treaties contained the same right.</p>
                        <p>I refer to Article XIV of the treaty of 1858 with the United States,
                            which is in accord with the treaties made with all the other powers. I
                            do not feel authorized to consent that American citizens shall be denied
                            the right of residence in the cities which were opened to trade and
                            residence by the Shimonoseki treaty. A question of this importance
                            should, it seems to me, be presented to you for determination.</p>
                        <p>I accordingly request that you will instruct me as to the line of action
                            to be adopted. As the Chinese Government is strongly urging the subject
                            upon me, instruction by telegraph might be sent to me if, in your
                            opinion, it is feasible and desirable to do so.</p>

                                the governor of Chekiang, embodying a report from the taotais of the
                                board of foreign affairs as under: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>In regard to the American merchant opening a life insurance
                                        office at a place called Yu Sheng Kuan Chiang, the office of
                                        foreign affairs addressed a communication to the United
                                        States consul requesting that instructions be issued to have
                                        the said office removed from the city, but no reply has been
                                        received to said communication.</p>
                                    <p>It appears that at Hangchow, in addition to the Japanese
                                        settlement, a large tract of land has been set apart at the
                                        Hung Chien Bridge as a trading place for foreigners. The
                                        land has been tilled in, roads made, and the banks of the
                                        river repaired. Police have been employed, and the outlay of
                                        money has been heavy. This has been done for the purpose of
                                        treating foreigners kindly and giving them due protection in
                                        carrying on their business. It can not be said that they
                                        have not been treated in a generous and liberal manner.</p>
                                    <p>The said American has established, in violation of treaty, an
                                        office in the city of Hangchow.</p>
                                    <p>Of the foreign trading ports in China, Shanghai dates the
                                        very earliest. It is situated on the Yang King Pan, and has
                                        been opened for over fifty years. It has never been heard of
                                        foreign merchants establishing hongs in the city of
                                        Shanghai. There is ample proof that foreign, hongs have not
                                        been established at the treaty ports of Chinkiang, Tientsin,
                                        and Foochow.</p>
                                    <p>In the first year of the reign of Tung Chih, the English firm
                                        styled Li Cha Su Yo(?) established an office at Kalgan. The
                                        Tsung-li Yamên addressed the British minister in regard to
                                        the matter, and received a reply that British merchants must
                                        confine themselves to the treaty ports; they are not
                                        permitted to open mercantile houses in the interior. There
                                        is no rule against their doing business at the open ports.
                                        The said American, in opening a life insurance office in the
                                        city of Hangchow, is in violation of treaty.</p>

                            <p>The gentry of the city of Hangchow have also petitioned as follows:
                                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>The trading port has been fixed and decided on. It is
                                        situated at Hung Chien Bridge. Foreign merchants have stated
                                        that when their hongs have been built in the settlement they
                                        will at once move from the city; still mercantile signboards
                                        have been put out and it would seem that they are not merely
                                        doing business temporarily in the city.</p>
                                    <p>The people have their suspicions. Besides, the autumn
                                        examinations for the second degree will take place, at which
                                        a large concourse of students will appear, and it is to be
                                        greatly feared that some unexpected misfortune may
                                        occur.</p>
                                    <p>It would seem that the treaty is violated by establishing
                                        foreign firms in the city of Hangchow, as there is no
                                        boundary or fixed limit there. In the first place, foreign
                                        business should not be conducted there, and in the second
                                        place, it is to be feared that the people would not be
                                        orderly and quiet, and trouble would ensue, involving
                                        foreigners, and it is to be apprehended that it would be no
                                        easy matter to give adequate protection to them.</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>The governor would observe that a settlement has been marked off at
                                Hangchow, at a place called Hung Chien Bridge, where foreigners can
                                carry on trade, purchase land, and erect mercantile establishments.
                                Hangchow is a city divided into sections. There are a great many
                                Chinese doing business there. If foreign merchants are also to do
                                business there, they will be right among the Chinese.</p>
                            <p>The governor further states that it is his duty to keep order in
                                Hangchow, and nothing has been said about the city being opened as a
                                trading place for foreigners. Further, the benefits that would
                                accrue to foreign trade in the settlement would be best.</p>
                            <p>The request is made that the minister of the United States be
                                communicated with, asking him to issue instructions to have the said
                                life insurance office removed from the city of Hangchow, and that no
                                passports be issued to American merchants to establish business
                                offices in the city of Hangchow.</p>
                            <p>The Yamên would observe that the foreign settlements are not a
                                dwelling place for both Chinese and foreign merchants. They are
                                separated, and hence peace and quiet prevail among them. This is in
                                    <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0109"/>accordance with treaty as
                                well as precedent, and both foreigners and natives should conform
                                thereto. A foreign settlement has been marked off and limits denned
                                at a place called Hung Chien Bridge at Hangchow, and it is right
                                that the said life insurance company should open its office within
                                the limits of said settlement.</p>
                            <p>The representations of the governor of Chekiang are in conformity to
                                treaty stipulations, and his object is that foreigners and natives
                                should live in peace and quiet, and trouble thus be avoided.</p>
                            <p>The Yamên, in presenting the governor’s report, would again ask the
                                minister of the United States to issue instructions to the consul
                                concerned for the immediate removal of the office of said life
                                insurance company from the city of Hangchow; and the request is also
                                made that no passport issue to American merchants who wish to
                                establish their business places in said city, in order to have a
                                clearly defined limit where foreign merchants may do business, and
                                thus give due observance to treaty stipulations.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Highnesses and Your Excellencies</hi>: I
                                have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your dispatch of the
                                28th ultimo, relating to the residence of an American citizen in the
                                city of Hangchow. You therein set forth a communication from the
                                governor of Chekiang embodying a report from the taotais of the
                                board of foreign affairs, from which it appears that, in addition to
                                the Japanese settlement, a large tract of land has been set apart at
                                the Hung Chien Bridge as a trading place for foreigners. You further
                                state that an American has established, in violation of treaty, an
                                office in the city of Hangchow, and you ask that I direct him to
                                remove from said city. I am unable to see any reason why, under the
                                treaties, the said American, or any other foreigner, has not the
                                right to reside in Hangchow. This right of residence is secured by
                                the sixth article of the Shimoneseki Treaty as to the four towns
                                which were opened by that treaty. The right of residence is
                                guaranteed in cities which are opened to trade in all treaties made
                                between China and foreign powers.</p>
                            <p>The right of residence is allowed in many cities of China, among
                                which are Chinkiang, Kiukiang, Wuhu, Ichang, Chungking, and Swatow.
                                It existed also as to Canton and Foochow.</p>
                            <p>The question involved touches the interest of all nationalities
                                having treaties with China. It does not come within the purview of
                                my duty to arbitrarily settle this question. I have referred it to
                                my Government, and I request you to avoid taking any action thereon
                                until I shall have received instructions on the subject. I suggest
                                also that this question is a suitable one to be brought before the
                                diplomatic body for its action thereon. At this season the members
                                of the diplomatic corps are scattered in the country, at some
                                distance from Peking, and one is in Japan. The weather and the
                                condition of the roads make it difficult to secure a meeting of the
                                foreign representatives immediately. I will take measures to secure
                                such a meeting as soon as I can. I respectfully request that you
                                suspend all action until such meeting can be had.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch No. 2789, of the 5th
                            instant I submitted to the Department a dispatch from the Chinese
                            Government concerning the right of an American citizen to establish
                            business quarters in the city of Hangchow, out of the limits of the
                            foreign concessions, and a copy of my reply thereto. In this reply I
                            expressed the opinion that foreigners had the right to reside in
                            Hangchow under Article VI of the Shimonoseki treaty, but I stated that
                            the question as regards Americans had been referred to you, and I
                            requested that pending your instructions no action be taken.</p>
                        <p>I am now informed that the Japanese Government does not regard the
                            Shimonoseki treaty as conferring on Japanese the right of residence at
                            Hangchow and Soochow beyond the limits of the Japanese concessions. I
                            learn also that England and other powers will acquiesce in the
                            contention of China that foreigners shall establish their business
                            premises within the concessions designated for them at these cities. In
                            my dispatch to you above referred to I stated that I did not feel
                            authorized to consent that Americans should be denied the right of
                            residence in the cities open to trade. It is evident, however, that it
                            is inadvisable for this legation to insist on privileges under Japanese
                            treaties which the Japanese themselves waive and which are not asserted
                            in behalf of the citizens of the other powers. Unless, therefore, the
                            diplomatic body unites in a demand for unrestricted residence at the
                            above cities, or unless the right of residence should be exercised by

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department’s instruction to you (No.
                            1502, of the 16th ultimo) acknowledged the receipt of your dispatch No.
                            2794, of the 30th of August last, concerning the right of an American
                            citizen to establish business quarters in the city of Hangchow outside
                            of the limits of foreign concessions, and acquiesced in your conclusion,
                            that in view of the attitude of the other powers on the question you
                            would refrain from further insistence upon such rights in behalf of
                            American citizens, unless the diplomatic body should unite in a demand
                            for unrestricted residence in cities open to trade, or unless the right
                            of residence should be exercised by citizens of other powers.</p>
                        <p>The circumstances of the question which had regard to the right of
                            residence at Soochow and Hangchow, two of the cities recently opened to
                            foreign residence under the treaty of Shimonoseki, of April, 17, 1895
                            (printed in <ref target="frus1895p1#pg_200">Foreign Relations, 1895, pp
                                200</ref>–<ref target="frus1895p1#pg_203">203</ref>), had been
                            presented in your previous dispatches, Nos. 2785, 2787, and 2789, and
                            were made the occasion of an exhaustive examination by the Solicitor of
                            this Department, with the conclusion that the circumstances would not
                            warrant insistence by this Government upon a contention for the
                            unrestricted residence of American citizens outside of those foreign <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0111"/>concessions, unless the privilege
                            claimed by them be claimed for and conceded to the subjects of Japan or
                            of other nations, in which event this Government would be in a position
                            to claim it under the operation of the most favored nation clause. This
                            conclusion is reached by the necessary correlation of the relevant
                            article of the treaty of peace of April 17, 1895, with article 4 of the
                            later China-Japan treaty of commerce and navigation, signed at Pekin,
                            July 21, 1896 (a copy of which was transmitted to the Department with
                            Minister Dun’s dispatch No. 430, dated Tokyo, December 2, 1896). The
                            comprehensive views expressed by you in your letter to Consul-General
                            Jernigan of July 30, 1897 (of which copy accompanied your No. 2787),
                            appear to have rested upon your cumulative interpretation of the latter
                            fourth article of 1896.</p>
                        <p>It now, however, appears from your No. 2794, of August 30, 1897, that you
                            have independently reached the views here entertained as to the
                            doubtfulness of the construction which you had theretofore placed on the
                            Shimonoseki treaty. A copy of the opinion of the Solicitor is,
                            therefore, inclosed for your information.</p>
                        <p>It is presumed that, in view of Japan’s action in not claiming for
                            Japanese subjects privileges of residence outside of foreign concessions
                            in the recently opened treaty ports, and of the reported disinclination
                            of Great Britain and other powers to raise such issue in regard to their
                            subjects, you will have appropriately modified your instruction to the
                            consul-general, reported in your No. 2785 of July 28 last, whereby you
                            directed him to enter protest with the Chinese authorities at Soochow
                            against their proclamation forbidding Chinese to sell land to foreigners
                            outside of the foreign concession at Soochow, where the case is the same
                            as at Hangchow.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully, etc.,</p>

                                other port or place hereafter by treaty with other powers or with
                                the United States opened to commerce, and to reside with their
                                families and trade there.”</p>

                            <p>In a note dated July 28, 1897, addressed to Minister Denby, the
                                Tsung-li Yamên asked that instructions be issued to have the office
                                of the American Life Insurance Company removed from the city of Hang
                                Chow, stating that “at Hang Chow, in addition to the Japanese
                                settlement, a large tract of land has been set apart at the Hung
                                Chien Bridge as a trading place for foreigners; that the said
                                American has established in violation of treaty an office in said
                                city; that the trading port has been fixed and decided on; it is
                                situated at Hung Chien Bridge.* * * The land has been filled in,
                                roads made, police have been employed, and the banks of the river
                                repaired;” that this has been done for the purpose of treating
                                foreigners kindly, and giving them due protection in their business;
                                that foreign settlements are not a dwelling place for both Chinese
                                and foreign merchants, that they are separated, and hence peace and
                                quiet prevail among them) that a foreign settlement has been marked
                                off and limits defined at said bridge, and that said life insurance
                                company should open its office within the limits of said settlement;
                                that of foreign trading ports Shanghai is the oldest, over 50 years
                                old; that foreign merchants have never established hongs in the city
                                of Shanghai; that under the last clause of article 4 of the treaty
                                of commerce the right of American citizens is restricted within the
                                localities at those places which have already or may hereafter be
                                set apart for the use and occupation of foreigners.</p>
                            <p>Minister Denby’s contention is, first, that the said Shimoneseki
                                treaty confers upon American citizens the right to reside and trade
                                in cities opened by the Shimoneseki treaty pursuant to article 14 of
                                the said treaty of 1858; second, that the said commercial treaty
                                between China and Japan confers the same right; that article 4
                                distinctly confers that right, and the latter clause thereof grants
                                the same right in the localities which may be set apart for the use
                                and occupation of foreigners, and the latter clause is simply
                                cumulative, as all the old treaties contain the same right; that by
                                said article 6 the right of residence is guaranteed in cities which
                                are opened to trade in all treaties made between China and foreign
                                powers$ that the right of residence is allowed in many cities of
                                China, among which several are specified by name by Mr. Denby.</p>
                            <p>The only issue of fact made between Minister Denby and the Tsung-li
                                Yamên is the assertion of the Yamên that in the foreign trading
                                ports foreign merchants have never established hongs in the city of
                                Shanghai, which is cited as an example, and the contrary assertion
                                by Mr. Denby that this right of residence is allowed in many cities
                                of China, among which he names Ching Hiang, Kiukiang, and several
                                others.</p>
                            <p>For the purpose of considering this question the statement of fact
                                made by Minister Denby is accepted as the correct one.</p>

                            <p rend="center">CONSIDERATIONS.</p>
                            <p>Under the most-favored-nation clause of the treaty of 1858 citizens
                                of the United States are entitled to frequent and reside at any port
                                open to commerce by treaty with any power. The solution of the
                                question, therefore, depends on the construction—on the extent and
                                limitation—of the concession made in the two treaties between Japan
                                and China. By the treaty of peace the concession is limited to “the
                                same conditions and with the same privileges and facilities as exist
                                at the present open cities, towns, and ports of China.” Mr. Denby
                                says that “the right of residence is allowed in many cities of
                                China.” But whether such residence arises by bare license, or as a
                                mere matter of grace, or by strict treaty right, is not shown, and
                                in the absence of such specific information it does not seem prudent
                                to predicate the construction of the treaty by reference to such
                                fact.</p>
                            <p>The question seems to be complicated by further provisions in article
                                6 of the treaty of peace, not mentioned in the package of
                                correspondence of Mr. Denby. It provides: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>All treaties between Japan and China having come to an end,
                                        in consequence of war, China engages, immediately upon the
                                        exchange of the ratifications of this act, to appoint
                                        plenipotentiaries to conclude, with the Japanese
                                        plenipotentiaries, a treaty of commerce and navigation and a
                                        convention to regulate frontier intercourse and trade. The
                                        treaties, conventions, and regulations now existing between
                                        China and European powers shall serve as a basis for the
                                        said treaty and convention between Japan and China. From the
                                        date of the exchange of the ratifications of this act until
                                        the said treaty and convention are brought into actual
                                        operation the Japanese Government, its officials, commerce,
                                        navigation, frontier intercourse and trade, industries,
                                        ships, and subjects shall in every respect be accorded by
                                        China most-favored-nation treatment.</p>

                            <p>Then follows the above-quoted provision, beginning: “China makes, in
                                addition, the following concessions,” etc. The article concludes as
                                follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>In the event additional rules and regulations are necessary
                                        in connection with these concessions, they shall be embodied
                                        in the treaty of commerce and navigation provided for by
                                        this article.</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>It would seem that article 6 of the treaty of peace, by which the
                                concessions are granted, in effect provides for the making of
                                further rules and regulations in that behalf; and therefore article
                                6 is to be construed in connection with article 4 of the subsequent
                                treaty of commerce. The first clause of this article grants to
                                Japanese subjects the right to reside and carry on trade in the said
                                city. But the last clause of that article restricts the right to and
                                “within the localities at those places which have already or may
                                hereafter be set apart for the use and occupation of foreigners.”
                                Considering together the two treaties between Japan and China, it
                                would seem that the Japanese subjects were clearly intended to be so
                                restricted, since any other construction would make the last clause
                                meaningless. But it may be said that while this restriction might
                                operate against the subjects of Japan, it would not operate against
                                the citizens of the United States, inasmuch as the treaty of 1858
                                contains no such restriction, and therefore, whenever such ports are
                                opened by treaty between China and any other nation, the concession
                                takes place under the treaty of 1858 in an unrestricted form.</p>
                            <p>But is that a fair and reasonable construction?</p>
                            <p>Clause 1 of article 6 of the treaty of peace grants to Japanese
                                subjects the treatment of the most favored nation. And this article
                                stipulates <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0114"/>expressly for the
                                future conclusion between the contracting parties of a treaty of
                                commerce and navigation, the basis of which should be the treaties,
                                conventions, and regulations now subsisting between China and
                                European powers, and stipulates ad interim for the
                                most-favored-nation treatment of Japanese subjects. Did Japan,
                                therefore, in the final treaty—in the treaty of commerce and
                                navigation—surrender the most-favored-nation treatment which she
                                obtained by the treaty of peace? If she did not (and it is presumed
                                that she did not), then other nations, under the most-favored-nation
                                clause, take the concessions subject to the same restrictions as
                                Japan. If, on the other hand, they take without restrictions, then
                                Japan also enjoys without restrictions; which would render
                                meaningless the last clause of article 4 of the treaty of commerce.
                                If, however, Japan is bound by the restriction made in said article,
                                it would seem that the delimitation of the concession to Japan
                                measures and delimits it to other nations.</p>
                            <p>The contention that the said last clause is merely cumulative would
                                seem inadmissible, since it violates a leading canon of
                                construction, that the instrument be so construed as that all parts
                                of it shall have a meaning; which would be the case if the last
                                clause simply qualifies and restricts the generality of the
                                preceding grant.</p>
                            <p>The motive for the provision exists in reasons of domestic policy,
                                thus making the Chinese contention an apparently reasonable one.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            No. 2629, of November 3 last. It presents a case which has arisen where
                            a citizen of the United States charged with the commission of a crime in
                            one consular district in China has gone to another district. It is
                            essential that he should be arrested and brought to trial in the
                            consular district in which the crime is alleged to have been committed.
                            There seeming to exist at present no authority under which this can be
                            done, you propose to make a decree or regulation providing that when a
                            criminal action is pending in any consular district in China against an
                            American citizen who may be found in any other consular district in
                            China, it may be lawful for the consul before whom the action is pending
                            to issue his warrant for the arrest of such person wherever he may be
                            found in China, and that such warrant shall be viséed by the consul in
                            whose district the accused may be found, and thereupon the accused may
                            be arrested and transported to the consular district in which the case
                            is pending, for trial before the consular court thereof.</p>
                        <p>For this proposal you ask the Department’s approval.</p>
                        <p>Our treaty with China granting extraterritoriality to citizens of the
                            United States provides that— <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p rend="flushleft">citizens of the United States who may commit any
                                    crime in China be subject to be tried and punished only by the
                                    consul or other public functionary of the United States thereto
                                    authorized according to the laws of the United States, (Treaty
                                    of 1844, article 21.)</p>

                        <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0115"/>
                        <p>To carry the provisions of the treaty into effect the act of June 22,
                            1860, was passed, investing with judicial authority the minister and
                            consuls duly appointed to reside in China. (Sec. 4083, Rev. Stat.) Each
                            of the consuls at the port for which he is appointed is authorized to
                            issue his warrant for the arrest of any citizen of the United States
                            charged with committing in the country an offense against law, and to
                            arraign, try, and sentence such offender. (Rev. Stat., 4087.)</p>
                        <p>There is no express provision in the law which declares that warrants
                            issued by consuls shall or shall not have effect beyond the limits of
                            their consular districts. The President is authorized to appoint
                            marshals for consular courts. (Rev. Stat., 4111.) It is declared to be
                            the duty of the marshal to execute all process issued by the minister or
                            by the consul at the port at which they reside, and to conform in all
                            respects to the regulations prescribed by the ministers, respectively,
                            in regard to their duties.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State in 1892 requested the opinion of the
                            Attorney-General on the question of the extent of the jurisdiction of
                            consular courts. Attorney-General Miller declined to express an opinion,
                            on the ground that the question was a judicial one, subject to review by
                            regular appeal provided by statute, and that any opinion thereon would
                            be beyond the power conferred upon him. He added that as no case
                            appeared to have arisen requiring a decision of the question, it seemed
                            to be purely hypothetical. He held, however, that a sentence of
                            imprisonment imposed in any of the regular courts of China may be served
                            out in any portion of China, and not necessarily within the limits of
                            the consul’s ordinary jurisdiction. (20 Opinions, 391.)</p>
                        <p>It seems to be well understood that a consul can not take jurisdiction of
                            general consular business beyond the limits of his district (par. 30,
                            Consular Regulations), and it is apprehended that the same rule applies
                            to the exercise of judicial functions in the present state of the law.
                            Assuming, then, that there is at present no provision for the
                            apprehension and bringing to trial of persons charged with committing
                            crime in one consular district who are found in another district, the
                            question arises, Can this defect be supplied in the manner proposed by
                            you?</p>
                        <p>Section 4086, Revised Statutes, provides that— <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Jurisdiction in both criminal and civil matters shall, in all

                                    to execute such treaties, respectively, and so far as they are
                                    suitable to carry the same into effect, extended over all
                                    citizens of the United States in those countries, and over all
                                    others to the extent that the terms of the treaties,
                                    respectively, justify or require. But in all cases where such
                                    laws are adapted to the object, or are deficient in the
                                    provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies, the common
                                    law and the law of equity and admiralty shall be extended in
                                    like manner over such citizens and others in those countries;
                                    and if neither the common law, nor the law of equity or
                                    admiralty, nor the statutes of the United States, furnish

                        <p>It would seem that these provisions of law were intended to meet just
                            such a contingency as that which has arisen. The right to try and punish
                            all citizens of the United States for crimes committed in China is
                            clearly given by treaty to our ministers and consuls. Our <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0116"/>statute passed to carry the treaty
                            provisions into effect prescribes how the jurisdiction conferred by the
                            treaty shall be exercised. It is to be exercised in conformity with (1)
                            the laws of the United States and (2) the common law.</p>
                        <p>It being seen that deficiencies might be found to exist in the laws of
                            the United States and in the common law, it was wisely provided (3) that
                            if these laws do not furnish appropriate and sufficient remedies, the
                            ministers shall, by decrees and regulations having the force of law,
                            supply such defects and deficiencies.</p>
                        <p>The power of the minister to make such decrees and regulations is limited
                            to furnishing “sufficient and appropriate remedies.” The regulation
                            proposed clearly relates to the furnishing of a remedy which is now
                            lacking, and it would seem that the authority of the minister to supply
                            this defect is ample. The form of the regulation as suggested by you
                            seems well adapted to meet the purpose, and your proposal is
                            approved.</p>

                            prevented from entering the Government examinations and competing for

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>; I had the honor of addressing
                                your excellency last year in regard to our trouble in the Southern
                                part of the province of Hunan, which was most satisfactorily
                                settled.</p>
                            <p>I now take the liberty of addressing you again, upon a subject which
                                has troubled and hindered us in our work here for years; namely,
                                Christians being prevented from entering the Government
                                examinations. They have gone up year after year, but have never been
                                allowed to enter the examinations and compete for honors. I have
                                gone in person and seen the magistrate of this prefecture in regard
                                to the matter. I stated to him that these Christians were being
                                deprived of their rights as citizens of China, and were branded as
                                outcasts; that we were hindered in our work by being accused of
                                teaching a religion which was so bad that whoever became a convert
                                to it lost his rights as a citizen. I have seen the magistrate
                                repeatedly about this. He always acknowledges to me the rights of
                                the Christians to enter the examinations, but said he could do
                                nothing to compel the Ling Pao, or examiners, to admit them.</p>
                            <p>We have petitioned the viceroy of Kwangtung, through our American
                                consul in Canton, year after year, but have secured nothing,
                                excepting replies that Christians could compete in the
                                examinations.</p>
                            <p>We know they have the right, but in this prefecture they have never
                                been permitted to enjoy that right.</p>
                            <p>The magistrate acknowledges their rights, and so has the viceroy, in
                                every reply to our petitions, and still all Christians are debarred
                                from entering the examination halls. We as American citizens are
                                accused of teaching a religion which is so vile that the Chinese
                                Government will not permit anyone who becomes a Christian to compete
                                for honors. We are thus greatly hindered in our work.</p>
                            <p>Every scholar in China aspires to honors and a government position.
                                The scholars are kept from uniting with the church and entering our
                                schools on account of this barrier.</p>
                            <p>I appeal to your excellency to help us in this matter. There is no
                                need of my appealing to the magistrate and petitioning the viceroy
                                any longer. Can we not have some stringent order from higher
                                authority that Christians are not to be hindered from entering the
                                examinations at the prefecture of Lien Chou and have the order
                                executed?</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Highnesses and Your Excellencies</hi>: I
                                have the honor to inform you that I have received a letter from an
                                American missionary at Lien Chou, in Kwangtung, in which he states
                                that Chinese converts to the Christian religion in that prefecture
                                are not allowed to compete at the Government examinations. The
                                matter has been frequently reported to the magistrate of the
                                prefecture by the missionaries, <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0118"/>but, while admitting that Christians have the right
                                to enter the examinations, he states that he can do nothing to
                                compel the examiners (Ling Pao) to admit them. The viceroy has year
                                after year been appealed to, through the American consul at Canton,
                                in behalf of the converts. His reply has uniformly been that
                                Christians may compete, but this has had no effect in removing the
                                prohibitions under which they suffer at Lien Chou.</p>
                            <p>The principle of religious toleration has been accepted by the
                                Chinese Government in treaties with many, if not all, western
                                powers. It is expressly declared in Article XXIX of the treaty made
                                with the United States in 1858 that those who quietly profess
                                Christian doctrines shall in no case be molested. In Article XII of
                                the treaty with France of the same year the Chinese Government
                                formally abrogates all that has heretofore been officially
                                proclaimed or published against the Christian religion, and this
                                abrogation was reaffirmed less than two years ago in an arrangement
                                entered into by your highnesses and your excellencies with the
                                French minister at Peking. The principle of religious toleration has
                                been repeatedly proclaimed by the Emperor and there is no question
                                that an attempt to place Chinese converts to Christianity under
                                civil disabilities, because of their faith, is a violation of the
                                laws of China as well as of the treaties with foreign powers. So
                                freely is this principle accepted by the Government and high
                                officials of China that the defiance of it by obscure local
                                officials in Kwangtung is presumption meriting the most severe
                                punishment.</p>
                            <p>I request you to issue stringent orders to the authorities at Lien
                                Chou that no Christian qualified to present himself at any
                                examination shall be hindered or discriminated against because of
                                his religious belief.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Highnesses and Your Excellencies</hi>: The
                                23d of November last I brought to your attention a demand on the
                                part of my Government that you should take cognizance of the conduct
                                of certain officials, who were named by me, relating to the
                                antiforeign riots which occurred at Kutien the 1st day of August,
                                1895, and that proper and suitable punishment be decreed against
                                them.</p>
                            <p>The 28th day of November last I had the honor to receive from your
                                highnesses and your excellencies an answer to the above-mentioned
                                communication. You therein state that on the 22d day of November,
                                1895, the viceroy at Foochow reported that twenty and more of the
                                offenders had suffered the death penalty, and twenty more had been
                                variously punished; that three officials mentioned in Commander
                                Newell’s report had been degraded; that a year had elapsed since the
                                case was settled, and that “it is not convenient now to pursue the
                                matter any further.”</p>
                            <p>You further state that the claim of Miss Hartford for injuries and
                                loss of property should be paid.</p>
                            <p>It is proper to state that I have received information that this
                                claim has been paid, and in regard to your promptness in discharging
                                this liability I return thanks.</p>
                            <p>I transmitted to the honorable Secretary of State a translation of
                                the communication of your highnesses and your excellencies, and have
                                received from him instructions to insist by all proper methods on
                                the punishment of the officials mentioned.</p>
                            <p>The honorable Secretary remarks that the “argument that it is a year
                                since the case was settled’ is most extraordinary, and thus (your)
                                dismissing the subject because it is not convenient to pursue the
                                matter any further’ is hardly the way this Government would have
                                expected that of China to endeavor to dispose of such an important
                                matter.”</p>
                            <p>I submit to you that it is not too late to investigate the conduct of
                                the delinquent officials and to punish them for their connivance or
                                negligence.</p>
                            <p>I can not too often repeat to you that the only way, or at least the
                                most efficacious way, to prevent the recurrence of antiforeign riots
                                in China—which I am sure you desire to prevent—is to hold the
                                officials responsible for acts of violence perpetrated in their
                                respective jurisdictions. As long as nothing is done but to pay
                                damages for injuries done to foreigners, riots will continue. The
                                payment of damages constitutes no penalty against the rioters. They
                                may be said even to be benefited by riots which involve destruction
                                of property, because the repairing of <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0120"/>damages furnishes many of them work. If the
                                officials are not punished, the people conclude that you and the
                                Government of China approve of the riots. This conclusion, indeed,
                                is inevitable, because in all matters affecting the Government of
                                China, or the individual subject thereof, a rigid official
                                accountability is insisted on. What I ask you to do is simply to
                                treat with the same rigor crimes against foreigners as you now treat
                                crimes against Chinese subjects.</p>
                            <p>There is no question but that under the treaties foreigners have the
                                right to demand such equal treatment, and the sooner China openly
                                admits this principle to be correct and puts it into practice the
                                better it will be both for the Government and the people of China
                                and for the foreigners dwelling in its borders.</p>

                            last, I informed you that I would transmit the written answer of the
                            Tsung-li Yamên to your request that the Rules for the Prevention of

                        <p>It will be seen that the application of the rules is limited to two

                            native junk does not come within the operation of these rules. There are
                            many of these vessels plying between the northern and southern ports.
                            They are not within the jurisdiction of the inspector-general of
                            customs. I beg to be informed if it be your desire to endeavor to extend

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: In the matter of the rules
                                for the prevention of collisions at sea the princes and ministers
                                have received repeated communications from the minister of the
                                United States inquiring whether China would accept them or not, and
                                asking for an early reply in order that he might telegraph his
                                Government on the subject.</p>
                            <p>The Yamên communicated with the ministers superintendent of northern
                                and southern trade, as well as instructed the inspector-general of
                                customs to consider the rules and report on them.</p>
                            <p>Sir Robert Hart, inspector-general of customs, has now reported that
                                the rules for the prevention of collisions at sea were considered
                                and proposed at an international conference. The United States and
                                Great Britain made some slight alterations and amendments in them
                                and they have now been decided upon as the international rules to be
                                carried into effect.</p>
                            <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0121"/>
                            <p>All the great powers have agreed to them, and China should act in
                                concert with them and also agree to them. The inspector-general
                                proposes, however, that China should agree to the rules now as being
                                applicable to two classes of vessels—men of war and merchant vessels
                                of foreign type—and they should be adopted at the date fixed. To
                                this end he requests that the Yamên instruct the ministers
                                superintendent of northern and southern trade to issue proclamations
                                so that due preparation may be made for giving effect to the rules
                                at the time named.</p>
                            <p>The inspector-general submits the above for the consideration of the
                                Yamên as to whether the rules should be adopted by China or not.</p>
                            <p>The princes and ministers would observe that the suggestions of the
                                inpector-general of customs are opportune, and as the rules have
                                been satisfactorily modified by the United States and Great Britain
                                and agreed to by those powers they will certainly prove advantageous
                                and beneficial to commerce. China is also willing and agrees to
                                adopt them.</p>
                            <p>The princes and ministers would further state that they have
                                addressed the ministers superintendent of northern and southern
                                trade to have the rules carried into effect at the date fixed and
                                instructed them to issue proclamations ordering Chinese war vessels
                                and merchant vessels of foreign type to comply with them.</p>
                            <p>In sending this’ reply the princes and ministers beg that the
                                minister of the United States will communicate the above for the
                                information of the honorable Secretary of State.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch No. 2614, of October 18
                            last, I inclosed a copy of a communication sent by me, as dean of the
                            corps diplomatique, to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, wherein
                            it was stated that the foreign representatives acquiesced in the
                            suggestion for the appointment of a committee of merchants to inquire
                            into and report on the taxation of foreign trade in China.</p>
                        <p>This suggestion was adopted by the chamber of commerce. A committee was
                            formed, including representatives of every branch of commerce, and was
                            divided into subcommittees. These subcommittees are now engaged in
                            compiling materials for sectional reports. To these reports will be
                            added such further information as may be obtained from the chambers of
                            commerce at the treaty ports.</p>
                        <p>The chamber has adopted the plan of forwarding to the foreign
                            representatives copies of each sectional report as soon as it is
                            prepared. I have received the report of the sectional committee on
                            cotton mills, and I inclose a copy thereof herewith. This report sets
                            forth the reasons and arguments on which foreign cotton mill owners in
                            Shanghai base their claim to moderate taxation of their manufactures.
                            The question of raising the tariff rate is left out of consideration.
                            This question can not be entirely eliminated from a discussion on
                            taxation. The sole purpose of China is to raise more revenue, of which
                            it stands in great need. Whether such revenue shall be raised by
                            increasing the tariff only, or by local taxation, or by both means, must
                            be discussed and decided.</p>
                        <p>The report under consideration assumes that, under the fourth clause of
                            the second section of Article VI of the Shimoneseki treaty, articles
                            manufactured in China were to stand on the same footing as imported
                            articles. It concedes that this provision has been surrendered by Japan
                            (see 2616 of October 20, 1896), but it claims that the cotton mills,
                            which were organized before the annulment of this clause, and on the
                            assumption that they would be exempt from taxation, are entitled to
                            exemption. How this contention might affect claims for damages need not
                            now be discussed, but that it would legally bar the levy of any tax can
                            not be admitted, more especially as China always disputed the Japanese
                            construction of the clause as to taxation.</p>
                        <p>This portion of the report is, therefore, not entitled to any
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>The first principle enunciated is that the cotton industry should be
                            fostered by freedom from taxation, but if that be impossible, “the duty
                            or excise should never exceed the duty levied upon imported yarn <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0123"/>less the transit duty paid upon
                            the raw cotton which enters into its manufacture.”</p>
                        <p>For the argument on this subject I refer to the report itself.</p>
                        <p>The second suggestion is that raw cotton purchased in the interior for
                            treatment in the mills shall pay transit duty as if destined for export,
                            and no other duty.</p>
                        <p>The third suggestion is that all imported cotton should be free from
                            duty.</p>
                        <p>The fourth suggestion is that foreign-owned mills shall enjoy the same
                            privileges as native mills.</p>
                        <p>The committee proceeds to state that any higher taxation than that
                            suggested will result in the loss of China’s advantageous position as a
                            manufacturing country. The committee enlarges on the advantages of cheap
                            labor and raw material, the value of the trade to China, the absence of
                            taxation on cotton in India and America, the injustice of a 10 per cent
                            tax, and other matters going to support the argument in favor of a low
                            taxation.</p>
                        <p>It is apparent from this report that the committee looks chiefly to
                            securing benefits for the foreign mill owner operating in China.
                            Incidentally the benefits to accrue to China are considered. Nowhere,
                            however, is any question raised as to the interests of the manufacturers
                            in the United States and in Europe. As I have repeatedly stated in
                            former dispatches, I am unable to see how the interests of my own
                            country are to be forwarded by fostering cotton manufacturing in China.
                            I believe, also, that all questions affecting taxation of foreign goods
                            should be treated together.</p>
                        <p>I await your instructions on the questions involved.</p>

                                manufactures.</hi></head>
                            <p>In the communication addressed to the doyen of the corps
                                diplomatique, at Pekin, by the chamber of commerce on 17th September
                                were contained certain suggestions as to the taxation of locally
                                spun yarns, together with an outline of the procedure which, in the
                                chamber’s opinion, would best serve to foster a new industry and, at
                                the same time, benefit the Imperial revenue. Those suggestions were
                                put forward, however, upon the supposition that a revision of the
                                treaty tariff was under contemplation, and the chamber of commerce
                                was, at that date, unacquainted with the since-published text of the
                                treaty of commerce and navigation between China and Japan. But
                                since, by Article XXVI of that treaty, the question of tariff
                                revision appears to be removed from the necessity of immediate
                                consideration, the suggestions submitted by the chamber, so far as
                                they are based on that expectation, are no longer pertinent. This
                                committee begs, therefore, to reopen the subject and, putting aside
                                all question of increased import duties, to deal with the position
                                of Shanghai foreign-owned cotton mills.</p>
                            <p>And first this committee would point out that, though the importation
                                of industrial machinery was not excluded under treaty rights, all
                                doubt on the subject was removed on the concession by China of
                                manufacturing rights under the Shimonoseki treaty, and the
                                commencement of foreign-owned mills was the result. The terms of
                                that concession have, it is true, been materially affected since
                                then by the protocol of 19th October (Article III), but it was owing
                                to the nature of the terms set forth in the Shimonoseki treaty that
                                capital was forthcoming to establish these enterprises, and this
                                committee ventures to submit that, howsoever those terms may have
                                been modified by subsequent negotiations between China and Japan,
                                all mills built before the publication of the protocol are morally
                                entitled to such advantages as they would have enjoyed under the
                                terms of the treaty itself. The existing mills <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0124"/>were established and much capital
                                invested therein on the assumption that they would be exempt from
                                taxation; and to impose a high rate of duty now would, in this
                                committee’s opinion, be an act not only highly prejudicial, but one
                                from which the Government would derive no lasting benefit.</p>
                            <p>After mature deliberation on the subject, the committee urges as
                                conditions essential to the prosperity of the cotton industry in
                                China:</p>
                            <p>1. That the industry should be fostered by freedom from taxation, but
                                if this be impossible and the Chinese Government determined to tax
                                it, the duty, or excise, should never exceed the duty levied upon
                                imported yarn less the transit duty paid upon the raw cotton which
                                enters into its manufacture.</p>
                            <p>Cotton in imported yarn does not yield revenue to the Chinese
                                Government as cotton, and were locally spun yarn to be taxed at the
                                same rate as imported yarn the cotton in it would be twice taxed,
                                first as cotton and secondly in yarn. Upon the scale of duty the
                                excise upon locally spun yarn would therefore be: <table rows="4" cols="2">

                                transit duty as upon cotton destined for export, this payment
                                freeing it absolutely from all likin and other exactions en route,
                                and it is suggested that the amount collected in this way might be
                                devoted to the use of the provincial authorities concerned in its
                                levy.</p>

                                mills, i.e., that there shall be no differential taxation of any
                                sort. (N. B.—Article III of the Tokyo protocol provides for
                                condition.)</p>
                            <p>This committee is firmly convinced, by careful study of facts and
                                figures, that any attempt on the part of the Chinese Government to
                                provide a large immediate revenue by higher taxation of yarn than
                                that suggested above can have but one result, viz, the loss of
                                China’s advantageous position as a manufacturing country. Cheap
                                labor and raw material can enable her to compete with foreign
                                countries in the cotton manufacturing industry only so long as she
                                does not hamper that industry by impolitic and excessive taxation.
                                This committee would therefore urge the vital necessity which exists
                                for the Peking Government to restrain the provincial authorities
                                from imposing levies on the raw material which would check
                                production.</p>
                            <p>There can be little doubt that the manufacture of yarn in China, if
                                wisely safeguarded and developed, must rapidly produce a volume of
                                trade that will greatly contribute to the prosperity of the country,
                                compared to which the amount that might be levied by impolitic
                                taxation is a matter of insignificance; a trade which would not only
                                enrich the Imperial treasury, but which would give employment to
                                large and increasing numbers of the laboring classes. An unwise
                                fiscal policy at this juncture on the part of China will simply
                                result in benefiting other manufacturing countries at her expense,
                                and a new industry of great promise will be destroyed at its very
                                outset.</p>
                            <p>In foreign countries, such as India and America, which compete with
                                China as producers of the raw material, no taxes are imposed on
                                cotton. Similarly, in India and Japan (China’s competitors in the
                                yarn manufacture) no taxes are levied on the product of the mills.
                                The only charges, therefore, which Indian or Japanese yarns incur
                                are freight, insurance, and import duty.</p>
                            <p>Freight is a variable charge. From India it has been as low as 7 mace
                                per bale, and is at present the equivalent of 1.05 haikwan taels per
                                bale. Insurance is about 25 candareens per bale. Import duty is 2.10
                                haikwan taels per bale.</p>
                            <p>The total charge on Indian yarn varies, therefore, between 3.05 and
                                3.40 haikwan taels per bale, and on Japanese yarn, spun from Indian
                                and American cotton, it may be set down as being very little
                                higher.</p>
                            <p>In a recent proclamation, issued by the governor of Chekiang, new
                                cotton likin regulations are published. Amongst them is set forth
                                that the tax (likin) on seed cotton sent to Shanghai from that
                                province will be 40 cents a bale, which amounts to a tax of 2.65
                                haikwan taels on the quantity of cleaned cotton required to make a
                                bale of yarn and the average charges on Indian yarn, exclusive of
                                duty, being, say, <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0125"/>1.12
                                haikwan taels per bale, it is evident that under these regulations
                                the Shanghai spinner would be placed at considerable disadvantage.
                                If, in addition to this, the Tsung-li Yamên’s proposed 10 per cent
                                tax be imposed, the total taxation on locally-made yarn would amount
                                to 8.85 haikwan taels per bale, as against 2.10 haikwan taels, the
                                duty on imported yarn. In other words, foreign industry would be
                                protected against native to the extent of 6.75 haikwan taels per
                                bale. Such a policy could have but one result—native spinning being
                                rendered unprofitable, the industry would soon cease to exist.</p>
                            <p>It is the desire of this committee, and one for which they venture to
                                ask the earnest cooperation and support of the diplomatic body in
                                Pekin, that the tax on raw cotton in transit from the interior be
                                met by one payment of transit pass duty, such payment freeing the
                                cotton from likin and all other exactions, and that the central
                                Government be strongly urged to make and enforce a regulation to
                                this effect. Such transit duty, together with the proposed excise of
                                1.50 haikwan taels, as shown in paragraph 1, would amount to a total
                                payment of 2.10 haikwan taels per bale, against 2.10 haikwan taels
                                levied on foreign yarn, a tax which the mill-owners have some hope
                                that the industry could pay without endangering the financial
                                success of their enterprise.</p>
                            <p>At present Shanghai native-spun yarns pay no duty, so that by the
                                imposition of a reasonable tax on all mills, native and foreign, a
                                large and immediate increase will accrue to the Imperial revenue
                                without injury to manufacturing and commercial interests.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, the committee feels that it can not do better than
                                quote the following just and reasonable words from the Tsung-li
                                Yamên’s memorial to the Throne (August, 1895):</p>
                            <p>“It is very necessary to settle uniform tariff regulations without
                                making distinctions by virtue of which some pay heavier and others
                                lighter duties, so that it may be easy for all to conform
                                therewith.”</p>
                            <p>It is the committee’s earnest hope that only such moderate and
                                equitable taxation may be imposed as shall tend to the mutual
                                benefit of the Imperial treasury and of the commercial enterprises
                                whose interests the committee represents.</p>

                            are to be forwarded by fostering cotton industry in China, and that, in
                            your opinion, all questions affecting taxation of foreign goods should
                            be treated together.</p>
                        <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0126"/>
                        <p>In these remarks the Department concurs.</p>
                        <p>Our treaty right is to introduce into China, for sale to Chinese,
                            American manufactures at as low a duty and likin as the most favored
                            nation, and to export Chinese productions with as little export taxation
                            as possible. In order to export Chinese staples we should be allowed to
                            conduct all necessary processes to that end—that is, set up
                            silk-throwing mills, tea-packing hongs, etc.</p>
                        <p>It is not seen that the treaties give us a just claim to embark in
                            competition with native factories to supply the native markets. Neither
                            is it seen how we could, claim the right to set up cotton mills in China
                            in order to make Indian cotton into cheap cloths for Chinese
                            consumption.</p>
                        <p>The report of the committee is in favor of local manufactories (it
                            matters not whether set up by Chinese or foreign capital) for the
                            purpose of competing on the cheap-labor basis with foreign importations.
                            Our interest is to keep foreign markets open for our manufactures.</p>
                        <p>There is, therefore, no occasion for you to advocate the views set out by
                            the chamber of commerce, but you will continue to keep the Department
                            advised of the views of your colleagues and the mercantile communities
                            on this and kindred subjects touching the taxation of foreign trade in
                            China.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose copies of the
                            following sectional reports compiled by the special committee on
                            taxation at Shanghai: (1) Report on the piece-goods trade; (2) Sundry
                            imports; (3) General exports. I inclose a copy of a letter from the
                            chairman, C. J. Dudgeon, esq., covering these reports.</p>
                        <p>In the present condition of the questions involved it is not necessary to
                            make a minute comment on these reports.</p>
                        <p>I concur with the chairman in the statement that “so long as the present
                            system of arbitrary and unlimited provincial taxation continues, the
                            satisfactory development of the resources of the China trade must He a
                            matter of impossibility.”</p>
                        <p>The true theory is the substitution of one fixed duty payment for the
                            irregular and vexatious levies in force in China. It is plain that if as
                            soon as goods are landed and pass into the hands of a native consignee
                            they can be taxed inimitably, the trade in such goods is as injuriously
                            affected as if the tariff were increased to the amount of the local tax.
                            I have had several occasions to present this question to the Tsung-li
                            Yamên, and have succeeded twice in procuring a reduction of local
                            taxation, but such concessions were matters of grace. China still
                            asserts that she has the right to control at her own will her internal
                            taxation. Within certain limits she has this right, but the local tax
                            should not be prohibitory, and, of course, should affect all
                            nationalities alike.</p>
                        <p>Whether she has this right or not is not now the question. It is
                            understood that she desires to increase the existing tariff so as to put
                            duties on a gold basis.</p>
                        <p>The reports now submitted and others heretofore transmitted grew out of
                            the idea that when China makes application to the treaty powers <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0127"/>for a revision or an increase of
                            the tariff the powers might well demand, in consideration of their
                            consenting to an increase, the inauguration of certain reforms in the
                            treatment of foreign trade. These reforms are fully set forth in the
                            reports made by the committee on taxation, and will be minutely
                            discussed by me should there be occasion to do so.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor, as chairman of the
                                special committee on taxation, to forward herewith inclosed copies
                                (in duplicate) of the following sectional reports compiled by this
                                committee: (1) Report on the piece-goods trade; (2) Report on sundry
                                imports; and (3) Report on general exports.</p>
                            <p>With these reports the work of the committee ends, in so far as it
                                bears upon the general subject of taxation and possible tariff
                                revision; in forwarding these documents I would therefore venture,
                                on behalf of my colleagues and myself, to express the hope that the
                                result of the committee’s labors may serve to throw some light upon
                                the obstacles which chiefly stand in the way of commercial progress
                                in China, and to point out those measures which seem best calculated
                                to remove the disadvantages now affecting the Empire’s foreign
                                trade.</p>
                            <p>Putting aside for the moment the subject of tariff revision as a
                                matter upon the initiative of the Chinese Government, this committee
                                would point out that the general question of internal taxation is
                                one which per se calls urgently for reform. While it is fully
                                realized that, in the interest of the Chinese producer, certain
                                remedial measures—notably as regards the preparation of tea and
                                silk—are highly necessary for the stimulation of exports, the
                                keynote of each sectional report will be found in the conclusion
                                that so long as the present system of arbitrary and unlimited
                                taxation continues the satisfactory development of the resources of
                                the China trade must be a matter of impossibility.</p>
                            <p>Without going into the history of a question which has occupied the
                                attention of diplomatists at Pekin for forty years, there can be no
                                doubt that the object held in view by the framers of the Tientsin
                                Treaty was the substitution of one fixed duty payment for the
                                irregular and vexatious levies even then in force. This is
                                sufficiently proved by the correspondence which took place between
                                Lord Elgin and the foreign office in November, 1858, wherein this
                                object was unmistakably set forth. From the date of the Tientsin
                                treaty, however, until the present day, this important point has
                                been but imperfectly upheld in the face of the continual evasions
                                and complications wherewith the Chinese Government has surrounded
                                both the spirit and the letter of the treaty itself. Many years have
                                elapsed in the fruitless discussion of points which are undoubtedly
                                beside the main and vital principle; and the original intention of
                                Article XXVIII of the treaty, which was evidently to protect foreign
                                    <hi rend="italic">goods</hi>, irrespective of ownership, has
                                been too frequently lost sight of.</p>
                            <p>At the present time, although the protection afforded by the transit
                                pass system has been extended, such levies as grower’s taxes,
                                loti-shui, <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0128"/>and other forms of
                                local and terminal taxation show a distinct tendency to increase.
                                The right claimed by the Chinese provincial authorities to impose
                                such charges as they may think fit, both upon native produce before
                                it reaches the foreigner’s hands and upon foreign goods when they
                                have passed into possession of the native purchaser, must result in
                                restricting, if not frustrating, the objects for which the treaties
                                were made. To the foreign merchant it is a matter of indifference
                                from what class of natives—i.e., whether traders or
                                consumers—illegal levies are exacted. For him the essential point is
                                that they shall not be levied at all, and that his goods, having
                                paid the treaty duties leviable thereon, shall thereafter be free to
                                circulate throughout the length and breadth of China.</p>
                            <p>Around this question, therefore, center the grievances and
                                difficulties under which the foreign mercantile community labors
                                to-day, and upon its solution are founded this committee’s hopes of
                                a development of the China trade commensurate with the resources of
                                the Empire. It is the opinion of this committee that if any local,
                                terminal, or other taxation is recognizedly leviable by the
                                provincial authorities, such levies should be commuted once and for
                                all by a clearly defined increase in the existing tariff duties, and
                                that, this addition having been made, foreign trade should
                                henceforward be exempt from all further taxation whatsoever. The
                                question of assessing the proportion of the increased tariff duties
                                to be put aside for the compensation of provincial exchequers is one
                                with which the Chinese Government should be fully able to deal. Vide
                                the successful working of the opium Lekin collection by the I. M.
                                customs.</p>
                            <p>Hopefully commending to your consideration the work and aims of this
                                committee, I have, etc.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to state that upon my
                            receipt, in June, 1894, of a petition from the Chinese residents in
                            Bluefields, Nicaragua, proposing the appointment of Mr. Ferdinand Beer,
                            an American citizen, as a consular representative of China there, I
                            addressed a note to your Department, asking its good offices in
                            obtaining information regarding the character and standing of the said
                            Mr. Beer, which it did in due course by transmitting me copy of a note
                            from the United States minister to Nicaragua, speaking favorably of that
                            gentleman. It would have been a matter of gratification to me to bring
                            about the appointment of Mr. Beer as a consular agent of China, but the
                            nonexistence of treaty relations between China and Nicaragua precluded
                            the possibility of taking such a step. As there are diplomatic and
                            consular representatives of the United States in Nicaragua—and taking
                            for a precedent the case of Guatemala, where the United States minister,
                            by courtesy of his Government toward that of China, is permitted to
                            exercise his good offices on behalf of Chinese residing in that
                            Republic—I am led again to invoke the friendly offices of the United
                            States Government, <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0129"/>by which the
                            minister and consuls of the United States may be invested with the
                            proper authority to afford protection to those Chinese who may reside in
                            that country, and to ask that you will kindly direct the honorable
                            minister to obtain the assent of the Nicaraguan Government to the
                            proposed arrangement.</p>
                        <p>I further have the honor to state that I am in receipt of another
                            petition, received in March last from Chinese subjects residing in San
                            Salvador, requesting that the friendly offices of a representative of
                            the United States be obtained, by which the interests of Chinese in that
                            Republic may be cared for. As I find that your diplomatic representative
                            to Nicaragua is accredited in a like capacity to San Salvador, I beg to
                            invoke the same friendly offices of your Government as accorded in the
                            case of Guatemala and as above requested in the case of Nicaragua,
                            asking at the same time that your minister be directed to obtain the
                            assent of the Government of San Salvador to the arrangement above
                            proposed.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, permit me to say that the above proposals are made after
                            due advisement with my home Government, and that your favorable
                            consideration of the same would place me under deeper obligations to
                            your many kindnesses, and would be further evidence of the very friendly
                            relations existing between the Government of China and that of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Be pleased to accept, etc.,</p>

                            the minister of foreign affairs of Salvador to the chargé d’affaires of
                            the United States, to the effect that the Government of Salvador will
                            allow the diplomatic and consular officers of the United States to
                            exercise their good offices, unofficially, in behalf of Chinese
                            subjects, when necessary to protect their persons or property, I have
                            the honor to state that the Chinese residents of Salvador were duly
                            notified of the completion of the arrangement above referred to; and in
                            pursuance of my instructions a delegation was sent to call on your
                            Government’s representatives in Salvador to express the grateful thanks
                            of the Chinese community for their extreme courtesy and great kindness
                            in consenting to exercise their good offices in their behalf when
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the interview the delegation was informed that your
                            representatives deem it necessary to receive explicit instructions from
                            this Government before they would feel authorized to exercise their good
                            offices when desired. As the Chinese residents have intimated their
                            urgent need of the protection sought for, and inasmuch as your legation
                            has obtained the courteous acquiescence of the Government of Salvador to
                            the said arrangement, for which I feel profound gratitude, I beg to
                            request that you will be so good as to issue such instructions as you
                            may deem necessary to your representatives in Salvador upon the subject,
                            so that they may begin at once to exercise their friendly offices in
                            behalf of the Chinese residing in that Republic.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the Department’s No. 470,
                                of July 3 last, respecting the exercise of the good offices of our
                                diplomatic and consular officers to Chinese subjects residing in
                                Nicaragua and Salvador, and to your No. 693, of September 4 last,
                                reporting that Salvador will allow the representatives of the United
                                States to exercise their good offices unofficially in behalf of
                                Chinese subjects, I inclose herewith copy of a note from the Chinese
                                minister at this capital, stating that a delegation of Chinese who
                                called upon the consul at San Salvador was informed by him that he
                                deemed it necessary to receive explicit instructions from this
                                Government before he would feel authorized to exercise his good
                                offices.</p>
                            <p>The terms upon which protection is granted, at the request of the
                                Chinese Government, and with the acquiescence of that of Salvador,
                                are stated in the correspondence had with your legation, and the
                                Government of Salvador has been informed of the scope of such
                                protection, good offices being extended in behalf of Chinese persons
                                by you and the consular officers without assumption of any
                                representative functions as agents of China. It of course follows
                                that our officers so acting can not originally certify to the fact
                                of Chinese citizenship for a passport or other documentary
                                attestation to that end, which could only be issued by a responsible
                                agent of the Chinese Government.</p>
                            <p>This being so, a form of certificate to be used by you and the consul
                                at San Salvador should be prepared in consultation with the Salvador
                                minister of foreign affairs, in order that it may correctly express
                                the character of the protection afforded and the degree to which it
                                is recognized by Salvador. Something like this would probably
                                suffice: “I * * * , of the United States of America, certify that *
                                * * claims to be a subject of the Emperor of China, resident in
                                Salvador, and that upon proving his status as such Chinese subject
                                he is under the protection of the Government of the United States
                                and entitled to the good offices of the diplomatic and consular
                                officers thereof in case of need, in pursuance of an understanding
                                between the Governments of Salvador and China to that end.”</p>
                            <p>Similar action should be taken as regards Nicaragua, who your No.
                                687, of August 21 last, reported had likewise conceded the exercise
                                of your good offices.</p>

                        <p>The subject-matter is of growing importance. American travelers, and
                            especially missionaries, are traversing China in every direction. There
                            can not be the least objection on our part to their doing so provided
                            that in their journeying they exercise common prudence, and do not
                            recklessly or ostentatiously rush into localities such as the Mantsz
                            country, which are almost savage, and are scarcely under the firm
                            control of the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>I have deemed it to be my duty to issue a word of warning on this
                            subject, and submit what I have written for your approval.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received your dispatch No. 4,
                                of February 11 wherein, you bring to my attention a letter sent by
                                the foreign office at Chengtu to Rev. Mr. Cady.</p>
                            <p>This letter states that “there is at hand from the Kien Chang taotai
                                an official letter saying that Ta Shu Pao is on the great road and
                                missionaries of every country constantly pass along that way. At
                                present in going to Yueh She they will not go by Chin Che, but go
                                around by Whang Muh Chang, all the way a by-road. This is under the
                                Pien official and is full of Mantsz, a wild, mountainous road
                                distant from Pao five or six day’s journey, and it is not convenient
                                to send an escort and there is no place to change the escort. Also
                                from Chin Che to Kien Chang they will not go by the great road, but
                                according to their own will go by Ta Tien Pah, which is a nest of
                                Mantsz and there is no one to receive and relieve the escort.”</p>
                            <p>It is further stated that “Yueh Shi Ting is all Mantsz land and has
                                not intercourse with Kien Chang, and all the small roads are through
                                Mantsz country, and for the most part destitute of constables to
                                control the people.”</p>
                            <p>The purport of the whole letter is that missionaries traveling in
                                Kien Chang should go by the great road and should show their
                                passports to the local officials, and then an escort will be sent,
                                and they are on no account “to go by the small roads or enter the
                                Mantsz country or disturbed districts and bring upon themselves
                                trouble.”</p>
                            <p>In commenting on this letter Mr. Cady in a letter to you says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>First, let me say that I know of no American who has been
                                        traveling in the district of Kien Chang. The letter assumes
                                        that the treaty obliges travelers to go by the main roads
                                        and inform the officials of the proposed journey and obtain
                                        from them an escort. Of course you know that the treaties
                                        contain no such provision. * * *</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0133"/>
                            <p>As to the exhibition of passports Mr. Cady is correct. This question
                                is governed by Article IX of the British (Tientsin) treaty of 1858,
                                which provides: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>The passports must he produced for examination in the
                                        localities passed through.</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>The foreign representatives have construed that clause to mean that
                                on proper demand by a proper official passports must be exhibited,
                                but the traveler need not voluntarily show his passport, nor go out
                                of the way to hunt up an official for the purpose of showing his
                                passport.</p>
                            <p>As to the routes to be followed in traversing districts occupied by
                                the Mantsz, or any other disturbed districts, much must be left to
                                your discretion. If you consider any district to be dangerous, you
                                should inform the American citizen who proposes to travel therein of
                                his danger, and you should advise him not to venture in such
                                locality, and you should at all times furnish whatever information
                                you possess as to the safety of roads or routes.</p>
                            <p>It is not within your power to control the movements of your
                                fellow-citizens, but I am sure that our Government will not sanction
                                the needless incurring of risk of great danger by its citizens, and
                                there can be no doubt that in consideration of the protection
                                afforded by the Government it has the right to demand and will
                                demand the exercise of prudence and discretion from its
                                beneficiaries.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: By the instructions of the Department,
                            Consul Jones was directed to refer the question of dismissing the Kiang
                            Yin magistrate, Lin Yan-Kwang, from office to me if he failed in
                            securing his dismissal by the local authorities. Consul has now
                            transmitted the case to this legation.</p>
                        <p>It will be remembered that after the riot at Kiang Yin, which occurred
                            during my absence in Japan, the magistrate, Lin, was ordered to be
                            dismissed from office. At the urgent request of the taotai, Consul Jones
                            consented that Lin should be put back in his place temporarily, to give
                            him a chance to pay the indemnity which had been advanced for him by the
                            taotai. As sufficient time has elapsed for that purpose to be
                            accomplished, I instructed the consul to demand that the original
                            sentence be put in force. He made this demand of the governor of
                            Kiang-su, who resides at Soochow, and compliance was refused.</p>

                                consented that he should be put back temporarily in his place to
                                give him a chance to pay the indemnity which had been advanced for
                                him by the taotai.</p>
                            <p>Eight months have elapsed. Ample time has intervened to enable him to
                                pay the indemnity. By the instructions of his Government the consul
                                of the United States recently demanded of the governor of Kiang-su
                                that the original sentence be carried out; that is to say, that the
                                magistrate be dismissed from office. The governor refused to accede
                                to this demand.</p>
                            <p>I now bring the matter to your attention, and I request you to issue
                                orders to the governor of Kiang-su that the magistrate Liu be
                                immediately dismissed from office.</p>
                            <p>If you desire to prevent riots in China, you must see to it that
                                delinquent officials are punished. Especially, it will not do to
                                retain an official in office after he has been ordered to be
                                dismissed. Such treatment offers a premium for connivance at
                                lawlessness.</p>

                                investigation of the Kiang-yin riot last year, and the dismissal

                                dismissed at once, but the governor refused to accede to the
                                demand.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency requests the Yamên to issue orders to the governor of
                                Kiangsu that the magistrate, Liu, be immediately dismissed from
                                office, etc.</p>
                            <p>We have the honor to state that, in regard to this case, last year
                                perpetrators of the crime were punished, and indemnity for losses
                                sustained was paid and the matter settled—the money being paid to
                                the United States consul, who, at the time of receiving it, made not
                                the slightest objection.</p>
                            <p>We transmitted to your excellency on the 9th September, 1896, a
                                report on this case from the minister superintendent of southern
                                trades, stating that it had been closed. This is on record.</p>
                            <p>Now, having received your excellency’s note under acknowledgment, we
                                have the honor to state that we have looked through the records of
                                this case in the Yamên, but can not find any reference to the
                                question of the dismissal from office of Magistrate Liu.</p>
                            <p>We find it, therefore, difficult from our archives to guess or form
                                an opinion as to how the question arose, whether or not it was
                                talked of between the taotai and consul, or whether or not it was
                                presented clearly before the governor. The Yamên has written to the
                                governor of Kiangsu, presenting your excellency’s statements, and
                                requested an investigation to be made.</p>
                            <p>In the meantime, we send this note for your excellency’s

                                of his duty, was in the 1st moon dismissed from office and ordered

                            of a communication from the Tsung-li Yamên relating to the exhibition of
                            passports by travelers in China and matters connected therewith, also a
                            copy of my answer thereto.</p>
                        <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0137"/>
                        <p>The questions discussed come up periodically after every fresh outrage in
                            the interior. The provocation in this case was probably the recent
                            killing of a French-priest in the south.</p>
                        <p>It will be seen that I do not concede that Americans should hunt up the
                            local authorities in every town they pass through in order to exhibit
                            their passports. They are required by the British treaty of 1858, which
                            we have adopted as the rule on this subject, to exhibit them only when
                            their exhibition is demanded.</p>
                        <p>The demand of the Yamên that passports should be countersigned by the
                            local authorities applies to passports issued by consuls. As our consuls
                            do not issue passports there can be no application to us in the
                            statement made as to this matter.</p>
                        <p>It is reasonable, I think, to warn Americans not to travel in remote
                            localities infested by banditti.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: The princes and ministers
                                have the honor to inform the minister of the United States that on
                                the 8th of June last they received a communication from the governor
                                of Kwangsi stating that under the provisions of treaty when
                                foreigners travel in the interior of China they should have
                                passports issued either by their ministers or consuls, the passports
                                seating where they propose to travel and to be countersigned by the
                                local authorities.</p>
                            <p>The passports, if demanded by the local authorities, must be produced
                                for examination in the localities passed through.</p>
                            <p>Missionaries traveling in the provinces for the purpose of preaching
                                should conform to the rule laid down.</p>
                            <p>Recently cases have transpired of foreigners visiting Kwangsi who
                                have failed to exhibit their passports to the local authorities for
                                examination, and hence no trace of their movements could be
                                ascertained and due protection afforded them. This is in violation
                                of treaty, which requires that due protection be accorded them.</p>
                            <p>The Government requests that the foreign representatives at Pekin be
                                asked to instruct their consuls in the matter and that the viceroys
                                and governors of the various provinces should communicate with the
                                foreign consuls, asking them to instruct their missionaries to
                                present their passports for examination in the localities through
                                which they pass, to the end that due protection may be accorded them
                                as provided by treaty.</p>
                            <p>By the French treaty Frenchmen may reside permanently or move about
                                at their pleasure at the treaty ports or in places adjacent thereto
                                without passports, the same as natives residing in the interior.
                                Although the interior of Kwangsi can not be regarded in the same
                                light as a treaty port, still French missionaries have established
                                chapels and mission stations there, and some have permanently
                                resided there, while others have traveled at their pleasure, the
                                same as natives, in the interior.</p>
                            <p>It can not be said for certain when bad characters in the interior
                                and wandering banditti may appear, and when missionaries travel from
                                one place to another, and they do not inform the local authorities
                                    <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0138"/>of their whereabouts,
                                so that men may be deputed to protect, perhaps they might suddenly
                                find themselves confronted with banditti, and the officials in that
                                case would be put off their guard.</p>
                            <p>The governor requests that in accordance with the provisions of the
                                French treaty French officials will not deliver passports to their
                                nationals when they are applied for, except for places not infested
                                by banditti. He asks that in future all foreign missionaries be
                                instructed when traveling in the interior to avoid visiting places
                                inhabited by banditti, and also the impoverished and remote places
                                on the frontier.</p>
                            <p>In their travels they should also be instructed to present their
                                passports to the local authorities for examination, so that men may
                                be deputed to protect them and proper care be taken to avoid any
                                mishap to them.</p>
                            <p>The Yamên would observe that the representations made by the governor
                                of Kwangsi are based upon the treaties and for due protection to the
                                missionaries and foreign travelers.</p>
                            <p>Communications have been sent to the various viceroys and governors
                                on the subject, and as in duty bound, the princes and ministers send
                                this communication to the minister of the United States for his
                                action in the premises.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Highnesses and Your Excellencies</hi>: I
                                have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of
                                the 2d instant, relating to the exhibition of passports by travelers
                                in China and matters connected therewith.</p>
                            <p>This matter was elaborately discussed about three years ago. I
                                concede that Americans traveling in the interior should have
                                passports. I think they always have. I concede also that “these
                                passports if demanded must be produced for examination in the
                                localities passed through.”</p>
                            <p>This is the language of Article IX of the British treaty of 1858. I
                                do not concede that the traveler must exhibit his passport unless it
                                is demanded.</p>
                            <p>The passports should state the names of the provinces in which the
                                bearer thereof proposes to travel. It is impracticable to state the
                                route that he will follow. He secures the right to travel in four
                                provinces, and it is scarcely possible to state in advance what
                                routes he will take.</p>
                            <p>Different systems prevail in the various countries as to issuing
                                passports. Under our system the passports are issued by the minister
                                only. They are sent to you and are countersigned by the governor of
                                the city of Pekin. It is not necessary or practicable that any other
                                authority should countersign them.</p>
                            <p>It is true that Article IX, above cited, states that “passports will
                                be issued by their consuls (meaning British consuls) and
                                countersigned by the local authorities.”</p>
                            <p>As our consuls do not issue passports, this phrase has no application
                                to us. As nobody can countersign passports issued by this legation
                                except the governor of the city of Pekin, it is presumed that you
                                had no intention to refer to the United States in this matter.</p>
                            <p>You further state that all foreign missionaries should be instructed
                                not to visit places infested by banditti. I see no objection to this
                                suggestion. <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0139"/>I have warned
                                our consuls to represent to American travelers that there was danger
                                in traveling routes infested by banditti, and that such routes
                                should be avoided.</p>
                            <p>It will always afford me pleasure to cooperate with you in any
                                practicable suggestions as to rules governing passports, but it must
                                be borne in mind that in this matter the treaties control. They do
                                not require travelers to exhibit their passports unless they are
                                demanded, and I can not change the treaties. It is presumed that
                                they would be exhibited readily in case protection were needed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose herewith a
                            copy of a letter which I have received from a missionary residing at Tao
                            Cheo, Kansuh, on the borders of Thibet. He therein asks for information
                            on the question whether he can lawfully engage in “agriculture, stock
                            raising, or trading, in order to self-support while laboring as a
                            missionary among the Thibetan border tribes.”</p>
                        <p>This question is one of first impression in China. To my knowledge it has
                            not been raised by the Chinese Government. The treaties originally
                            permitted foreigners to reside at the open ports. They provided that the
                            professors of the Christian religion should not be harassed or
                            persecuted on account of their faith. Under the Berthemy convention the
                            right to reside in the interior and to buy land for residential purposes
                            was secured to missionaries. In no convention or treaty is anything said
                            about the right to carry on by foreigners residing there any regular
                            employment in the interior. In practice, however, it is a common thing
                            for missionaries all over China to engage in many species of employments
                            which are considered as aids or adjuncts to their religious and
                            charitable work. They have printing establishments, book binderies,
                            industrial schools, workshops, stores, dispensaries. They are doctors,
                            colporteurs, newspaper correspondents; one of them living here lodges
                            and boards strangers. All kinds of furniture is manufactured here and
                            publicly sold by missionaries. Washing and sewing are done by the
                            Catholic missionaries. In fact, there is complete tolerance of all <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0140"/>kinds of work. It is
                            understood, of course, that the profits of these various enterprises go
                            to the general fund of the mission, and are used to promote religious
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>In answering Mr. Simpson, I have not been able to draw the line between
                            pursuits thus permitted and agriculture, stock raising, or trading. Of
                            course much would depend on the manner that such pursuits were carried
                            on. The question of the right to engage in trade or commerce seems to
                            depend entirely on tolerance. If the particular enterprise engaged in in
                            any locality is not prohibited by the officials and is allowed to be
                            prosecuted without objection, it would finally be sanctioned by usage,
                            and might be entitled to protection of the treaty powers.</p>
                        <p>I have sent to Mr. Simpson an unofficial answer embodying the views above
                            stated.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch No. 2678, of February 3
                            last, relative to an inquiry addressed to you by a missionary residing
                            at Tao Cheo, Kansuh, as to whether he can, as a landowner, lawfully
                            engage in “agriculture, stock raising, or trading in order to
                            self-support while laboring as a missionary among the Thibetan border
                            tribes,” has been received.</p>
                        <p>Your views on the general question appear to be discreet. The secular
                            operations which you report as having been engaged in by various foreign
                            missionary establishments in China appear to be partly direct or
                            analogous adjuncts of their beneficent work and partly contributory to
                            its support. Some of them, as the manufacture of furniture, laundry
                            work, and sewing, are not, obviously, part of the privilege of
                            residence, and even if they were for any reason opposed, that
                            circumstance would not impair the argument which it is conceived might
                            be validly advanced, the case arising that the residential privilege
                            embraces all normal uses to which the ground and its belongings can be
                                <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0141"/>applied. Residence upon a
                            tract of agricultural land presupposes the devotion of the soil to its
                            natural use. The permitted purchase of such land carries with it the
                            right to till it for the owner’s support and advantage. Viewed in this
                            light, the rights accompanying the ownership of a farm seem to be more
                            unquestionably evident than the rights pertaining to the possession of a
                            dwelling house, since the use of the latter as a factory or shop is not
                            a positive necessity, such as is the raising of produce where farm lands
                            are held.</p>
                        <p>The matter is, however, as you intimate, one of tolerant custom, and if
                            attempt be at any time made to restrict the existing usage, the
                            propositions herein outlined would afford ground upon which to base
                            remonstrance and conduct suitable argument.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: The princes and ministers
                                have the honor to inform the minister of the United States that on
                                the 28th of May, 1807, they received a communication from the
                                Tartar-General of Foochow, embodying a report from the officials of
                                the board of foreign affairs in the matter of the casting of silver
                                coins. The board observes that recently there have been several
                                cases of arrests of persons in Amoy and in the Min district who have
                                counterfeited coins; that these dishonest persons have circulated
                                false reports that the silver dollars coined by the Provincial
                                Government of Foochow are not fit for circulation, and if prompt
                                measures are not taken to arrest this evil the present good method
                                in force of coining will come to a stop, as the people in general
                                will entertain suspicions.</p>
                            <p>It is only requisite that severe punishment be inflicted on the
                                offenders; then the legitimate coins will be in circulation to
                                advantage and the populace will be satisfied.</p>
                            <p>In the coining of counterfeit money it is necessary that machinery be
                                used. It is right that instructions be issued that coining machinery
                                made in China should not be sold to the people. As to machinery <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0142"/>made in foreign countries,
                                it seems proper that the Tsung-li Yamên should address the foreign
                                ministers at Pekin, requesting them to inform their secretaries of
                                state, or foreign offices, that in future it will be necessary that
                                all coining machinery imported into China must be accompanied by a
                                permit issued either by a commissioner of customs or a customs’
                                taotai. Further, the machinery must not be sold privately to
                                Chinese. A fine will be inflicted for violating this rule. It is
                                further suggested that instructions be issued to the ministers
                                superintendent of trade for the north and south, as well as to all
                                the commissioners of customs and the naval authorities at the
                                various ports, to take action in good earnest in searching all
                                vessels entering the ports, and if coining machinery is found on
                                board without a proper permit the importer will be arrested and
                                punished and the machinery confiscated.</p>
                            <p>The Yamên would observe that the counterfeiting of silver dollars is
                                detrimental to foreigners and Chinese alike.</p>
                            <p>Last year some of the foreign ministers were most concerned in regard
                                to the exportation from China of counterfeit coins, as the traffic
                                was very injurious to trade, and the Yamên was requested to take
                                active steps in the matter and to arrest and punish the
                                offenders.</p>
                            <p>The request made by the Tartar General of Foochow in regard to
                                prohibiting the importation of coining machinery is to preserve the
                                purity of coins, which your excellency will quite understand and
                                agree to.</p>
                            <p>Instructions have been issued to the ministers superintendent of
                                trade for the north and south, as well as to the inspector-general
                                of customs, to take action accordingly, and in addressing the
                                minister of the United States the princes and ministers express the
                                hope that he will take action in like manner.</p>

                            dispatch No. 2765, of the 19th ultimo, inclosing a request from the
                            Tsung-li Yamên asking your cooperation to prevent the importation into
                            China of machinery to be used for counterfeiting.</p>

                        <p>In reply I have to say that your instructions to our consuls will
                            apparently meet the requirements of the case in Chinese ports.</p>
                        <p>As to precautions against the exportation of counterfeiting machiney from
                            American ports, it is questionable if our laws permit such surveillance
                            over exported goods as would detect machinery of this character. The act
                            approved February 10, 1891, by its second section punishes the
                            possession with fraudulent intent of any die, hub, or mold of a foreign
                            coin. I inclose a copy of that act. Its enforcement lies with the
                            Secretary of the Treasury, to whom a copy of your dispatch will be
                            sent.</p>

                            <p>(1) According to the Ch’unch’iu (or Spring and Autumn
                                Annals—Translator) it has been stated that an eclipse of the sun on
                                the first day of “the year betokens an impending calamity, hence the
                                sovereigns of every dynasty which has preceded us have always made
                                it a point, whenever an eclipse of the sun is prognosticated, to
                                undergo self-abasement and humble themselves before heaven in order
                                to avert the wrath from above. In the case of our own imperial
                                dynasty, for instance, during the reigns of Their Majesties K’ang
                                Hsi and Ch’ien Lung (1662–1794) there were observed two eclipses of
                                the sun which fell on a New Year’s Day; and now, according to the
                                board of astronomy, the first day of the twenty-fourth year of our
                                reign (22d January, 1898) there will be yet another eclipse of the
                                sun. We are filled with forebodings at this news and hasten to seek
                                within ourselves for sins which may have thus brought the wrath of
                                high heaven upon the land. We further command that the ceremonies of
                                congratulation usually held on New Year’s Day in the Taiho throne
                                hall be curtailed and only ordinary obeisances be made, the place
                                being changed to the Ch’ientsing throne hall. The banquet usually
                                given to imperial clansmen on New Year’s Day must also be stopped,
                                and when the eclipse occurs let all the members of the court wear
                                sober garments and assemble in the inner palace before the altar set
                                up to heaven, to pray for forbearance and mercy to the country at
                                large. This is so far as shall concern ourselves, to show our desire
                                to propitiate high heaven; but, as Her Majesty the Empress Dowager
                                is an elder and senior, it is but right that the full ceremonies be
                                observed in paying the court’s obeisances to her majesty on New
                                Year’s Day. Let all the Yamêns concerned take note.</p>

                            Nicaragua, is to decide the points of disagreement that may arise
                            between such commissions, pursuant to the stipulations of said

                            questions which Costa Rica has constantly and unremittingly endeavored
                            to settle through just and honorable means; this act being all the more
                            appreciated by my country since thereby the step proposed by my
                            Government to that of Nicaragua ever since November 20, 1892, has been
                            achieved.</p>

                            legation, in regard to the appointment by His Excellency the President

                            commissions of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, is to decide the points of
                            disagreement that may arise between such commissions; and in
                            consideration of the attention kindly given by the Government of the

                            honor to inform your excellency that the work of tracing and marking the
                            boundary line between the two countries was commenced, and after some
                            discussion about the exact point where the said line enters from the
                            Caribbean Sea, the engineer arbiter decided this first point of

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen</hi>: In pursuance of the duties
                                assigned me by my commission as engineer arbitor to your two bodies,
                                with the power to decide finally any points of difference that may
                                arise in tracing and marking out the boundary line between the two
                                Republics, I have given careful study and consideration to all
                                arguments, counterarguments, maps, and documents submitted to me in
                                the matter of the proper location of the initial point of the said
                                boundary line upon the Caribbean coast.</p>
                            <p>The conclusion at which I have arrived and the award I am about to
                                make do not accord with the views of either commission.</p>
                            <p>So, in deference to the very excellent and earnest arguments, so
                                faithfully and loyally urged by each commission for its respective
                                side, I will indicate briefly my line of thought and the
                                considerations which have seemed to me to be paramount in
                                determining the question.</p>
                            <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0148"/>
                            <p>And of these considerations the principal, and the controlling one,
                                is that we are to interpret and give effect to the treaty of April
                                15, 1858, in the way in which it was mutually understood at the time
                                by its makers.</p>
                            <p>Each commission has presented an elaborate and well-argued contention
                                that the language of that treaty is consistent with its claim for a
                                location of the initial point of the boundary line at a place which
                                would give to its country great advantages. These points are over 6
                                miles apart, and are indicated on the map accompanying this
                                award.</p>
                            <p>The Costa Rican claim is located on the left-hand shore or west
                                headland of the harbor; the Nicaraguan on the east headland of the
                                mouth of the Taura branch.</p>
                            <p>Without attempting to reply in detail to every argument advanced by
                                either side in support of its respective claim, all will be met, and
                                sufficiently answered by showing that those who made the treaty
                                mutually understood and had in view another point, to wit, the
                                eastern headland at the mouth of the harbor.</p>
                            <p>It is the meaning of the men who framed the treaty which we are to
                                seek, rather than some possible meaning which can be forced upon
                                isolated words or sentences. And this meaning of the men seems to me
                                abundantly plain and obvious.</p>
                            <p>The treaty was not made hastily or carelessly. Each State had been
                                wrought up, by years of fruitless negotiations, to a state of
                                readiness for war in defense of what it considered its rights, as is
                                set forth in Article I.</p>
                            <p>In fact, war had actually been declared by Nicaragua, on November 25,
                                1857, when through the mediation of the Republic of Salvador a final
                                effort to avert it was made, another convention was held, and this
                                treaty resulted.</p>
                            <p>Now, we may arrive at the mutual understanding finally reached by its
                                framers, by first seeking in the treaty as a whole for the general
                                idea, or scheme of compromise, upon which they were able to
                                agree.</p>
                            <p>Next, we must see that this general idea of the treaty as a whole
                                harmonizes fully with any description of the line given in detail,
                                and the proper names of all the localities used, or not used, in
                                connection therewith; for the nonuse of some names may be as
                                significant as the use of others.</p>
                            <p>Now, from the general consideration of the treaty as a whole, the
                                scheme of compromise stands out clear and simple.</p>
                            <p>Costa Rica was to have as a boundary line the right or southwest bank
                                of the river, considered as an outlet for commerce, from a point 3
                                miles below Castillo to the sea.</p>
                            <p>Nicaragua was to have her prized “sumo imperio” of all the waters of
                                this same outlet for commerce, also unbroken to the sea.</p>
                            <p>It is to be noted that this division implied also, of course, the
                                ownership of all islands in the river and of the left or northwest
                                bank and headland by Nicaragua.</p>
                            <p>This division brings the boundary line (supposing it to be traced
                                downward along the right bank, from the point near Castillo) across
                                both the Colorado and the Taura branches.</p>
                            <p>It can not follow either of them, for neither is an outlet for
                                commerce, as neither has a harbor at its mouth.</p>
                            <p>It must follow the remaining branch, the one called the Lower San
                                Juan, through its harbor and into the sea.</p>
                            <p>The natural terminus of that line is the right-hand headland of the
                                Harbor Mouth.</p>
                            <p>Next, let us note the language of description used in the treaty,
                                telling whence the line is to start and how it is to run, leaving
                                out for the moment the proper name applied to the initial point. It
                                is to start “at the mouth of the river San Juan de Nicaragua, and
                                shall continue following the right bank of the said river to a point
                                3 English miles from Castillo Viejo.”</p>
                            <p>This language is carefully considered and precise, and there is but
                                one starting point possible for such a line and that is at the right
                                headland of the bay.</p>
                            <p>Lastly, we come to the proper name applied to the starting point,
                                “the extremity of Punta de Castilla.”</p>
                            <p>This name, Punta Castilla, does not appear upon a single one of all
                                the original maps of the Bay of San Juan which have been presented
                                by either side, and which seem to include all that were ever
                                published before the treaty or since.</p>
                            <p>This is a significant fact, and its meaning is obvious. Punta de
                                Castilla must have been, and must have remained, a point of no
                                importance, political or commercial.</p>
                            <p>Otherwise it could not possibly have so utterly escaped note or
                                mention upon the maps. This agrees entirely with the characteristics
                                of the mainland and the headland on the right of the bay.</p>
                            <p>It remains until to-day obscure and unoccupied, except by the hut of
                                a fisherman.</p>
                            <p>But the identification of the locality is still further put beyond
                                all question by incidental mention, in another article of the treaty
                                itself, of the name Punta de Castilla.</p>
                            <p>In Article V Costa Rica agrees temporarily to permit Nicaragua to use
                                Costa Rica’s side of the harbor without payment of port dues, and
                                the name Punta de Castilla is plainly applied to it.</p>
                            <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0149"/>
                            <p>Thus we have, concurring, the general idea of compromise in the
                                treaty as a whole, the literal description of the line in detail,
                                and the verification of the name applied to the initial point by its
                                incidental mention in another portion of the treaty, and by the
                                concurrent testimony of every map maker of every nation, both before
                                the treaty and since, in excluding this name from all other portions
                                of the harbor.</p>
                            <p>This might seem to be sufficient argument upon the subject, but it
                                will present the whole situation in a still clearer light to give a
                                brief explanation of the local geography and of one special
                                peculiarity of this Bay of San Juan.</p>
                            <p>The great feature in the local geography of this bay, since our
                                earliest accounts of it, has been the existence of an island in its
                                outlet, called on some early maps the Island of San Juan. It was an
                                island of such importance as to have been mentioned in 1820 by two
                                distinguished authors, quoted in the Costa Rican reply to
                                Nicaragua’s argument (p. 12), and it is an island to-day, and so
                                appears in the map accompanying this award.</p>
                            <p>The peculiarity of this bay to be noted is that the river brings down
                                very little water during the annual dry season.</p>
                            <p>When that happens, particularly of late years, sand bars, dry at all
                                ordinary tides, but submerged, more or less, and broken over by the
                                waves at all high ones, are formed, frequently reaching the adjacent
                                headlands, so that a man might cross dry-shod.</p>
                            <p>Now, the whole claim of Costa Rica is based upon the assumption that
                                on April 15, 1858, the date of the treaty, a connection existed
                                between the island and the eastern headland, and that this converted
                                the island into mainland and carried the initial point of the
                                boundary over to the western extremity of the island.</p>
                            <p>To this claim there are at least two replies, either one seeming to
                                me conclusive.</p>
                            <p>First, the exact state of the bar on that day can not be definitely
                                proven, which would seem to be necessary before drawing important
                                conclusions.</p>
                            <p>However, as the date was near the end of the dry season, it is most
                                probable that there was such a connection between the island and the
                                eastern or Costa Rican shore as has been described.</p>
                            <p>But even if that be true, it would be unreasonable to suppose that
                                such temporary connection could operate to change permanently the
                                geographical character and political ownership of the island.</p>
                            <p>The same principle, if allowed, would give to Costa Rica every island
                                in the river to which sand bars from her shore had made out during
                                that dry season.</p>
                            <p>But throughout the treaty, the river is treated and regarded as an
                                outlet of commerce. This implies that it is to be considered as in
                                average condition of water, in which condition alone is it
                                navigable.</p>
                            <p>But the overwhelming consideration in the matter is that by the use
                                of the name Punta de Castilla for the starting point, instead of the
                                name Punta Arenas, the makers of the treaty intended to designate
                                the mainland on the east of the harbor.</p>
                            <p>This has already been discussed, but no direct reply was made to the
                                argument of Costa Rica quoting three authors as applying the name
                                Punta de Castilla to the western extremity of the before-mentioned
                                island, the point invariably called Point Arenas by all naval and
                                other officers, surveyors, and engineers whoever mapped it.</p>
                            <p>These authors are L. Montufar, a Guatemalan, in 1887; J. D. Gamez, a
                                Nicaraguan, in 1889; and E. G. Squier, an American, date not given
                                exactly, but subsequent to the treaty. Even of these, the last two
                                merely used, once each, the name Punta de Castilla as an alternate
                                for Punta Arenas.</p>
                            <p>Against this array of authenticity we have, first, an innumerable
                                number of other writers clearly far more entitled to confidence;
                                second, the original makers of all the maps, as before pointed out;
                                and third, the framers of the treaty itself, by their use of Punta
                                de Castilla in Article V.</p>
                            <p>It must be borne in mind that, for some years before the making of
                                this treaty, Punta Arenas had been by far the most important and
                                conspicuous point in the bay. On it were located the wharves,
                                workshops, offices, etc., of Vanderbilt’s great transit company,
                                conducting the through line from New York to San Francisco during
                                the gold excitement of the early fifties. Here ocean and river
                                steamers met and exchanged passengers and cargo.</p>
                            <p>This was the point sought to be controlled by Walker and the
                                filibusters.</p>
                            <p>The village of San Juan cut no figure at all in comparison, and it
                                would doubtless be easy to produce by hundreds references to this
                                point as Punta Arenas by naval and diplomatic officers of all
                                prominent nations, by prominent residents and officials, and by
                                engineers and surveyors constantly investigating the canal problem,
                                and all having personal knowledge of the locality.</p>
                            <p>In view of all these circumstances—the jealousy with which each party
                                to the treaty defined what it gave up and what it kept, the
                                prominence and importance of the locality, the concurrence of all
                                the original maps in the name, and its universal notoriety—I find it
                                impossible to conceive that Nicaragua had conceded this extensive
                                    <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0150"/>and important territory
                                to Costa Rica, and that the latter’s representative had failed to
                                have the name Punta Arenas appear anywhere in the treaty.</p>
                            <p>And for reasons so similar that it is unnecessary to repeat them, it
                                is also impossible to conceive that Costa Rica should have accepted
                                the Taura as her boundary, and that Nicaragua’s representative
                                should have entirely failed to have the name appear anywhere in the
                                treaty.</p>
                            <p>Having, then, designated generally the mainland east of Harbor Head
                                as the location of the initial point of the boundary line, it now
                                becomes necessary to specify more minutely, in order that the said
                                line may be exactly located and permanently marked.</p>
                            <p>The exact location of the initial point is given in President
                                Cleveland’s award as the “extremity of Punta de Castilla, at the
                                mouth of the San Juan de Nicaragua River, as they both existed on
                                the 15th of April, 1858.”</p>
                            <p>A careful study of all available maps, and comparisons between those
                                made before the treaty and those of recent date made by boards of
                                engineers and officers of the canal company, and one of to-day made
                                by yourselves to accompany this award, makes very clear the
                                fact.</p>
                            <p>The exact spot which was the extremity of the headland of Punta de
                                Castilla, April 15, 1858, has long been swept over by the Caribbean
                                Sea, and there is too little concurrence in the shore outline of the
                                old maps to permit any certainty of statement of distance or exact
                                direction to it from the present headland. It was somewhere to the
                                northeastward, and probably between 600 and 1,600 feet distant, but
                                it can not now be certainly located.</p>
                            <p>Under these circumstances, it best fulfills the demands of the treaty
                                and of President Cleveland’s award to adopt what is, practically,
                                the headland of to-day; or the northwestern extremity of what seems
                                to be the solid land, on the east side of the Harbor Head
                                Lagoon.</p>
                            <p>I have accordingly made a personal inspection of this ground, and
                                declare the initial line of the boundary to run as follows, to
                                wit:</p>
                            <p>Its direction shall be due northeast and southwest, across the bank
                                of sand, from the Caribbean Sea into the waters of Harbor Head
                                Lagoon.</p>
                            <p>It shall pass, at its nearest point, 300 feet on the northwest side
                                from the small hut now standing in that vicinity.</p>
                            <p>On reaching the waters of Harbor Head Lagoon the boundary line shall
                                turn to the left, or southwestward, and shall follow the water’s
                                edge around the harbor until it reaches the river proper by the
                                first channel met.</p>
                            <p>Up this channel and up the river proper the line shall continue to
                                ascend as directed in the treaty.</p>
                            <p>I am, gentlemen, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                            the 18th instant, I have the honor to return, duly authenticated by the
                            secretary of state of the State of New York, the certificate you sent me
                            of the naturalization of Jens A. E. Sorensen by the county court of
                            Kings County on the 20th day of October, 1891.</p>
                        <p>It would appear from your note that the purpose of your inquiry touching
                            the authenticity and competent issuance of the certificate in question
                            is to ascertain the truth of Mr. Sorensen’s allegation of United States
                            citizenship, in view of the charge of violation of the military-service
                            law of Denmark which has been laid against him. While the naturalization
                            of aliens in this country is by the laws here of a function of any State
                            court of record having a seal, a passport issued by or by authority of
                            the Secretary of State is by statute the only certification of
                            citizenship that may be granted by the Federal branch for use abroad in
                            attestation of the party’s rights to protection as a citizen.</p>
                        <p>It does not appear that Mr. Sorenson has applied to the United States
                            legation at Copenhagen for protection, or that the representative of the
                            United States has been notified of the charge against this man. A copy
                            of your note and of the reply will be sent to the legation in order that
                            it may, upon Mr. Sorenson’s application, issue to him a passport, <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0152"/>should the facts establish his
                            right to protection as a citizen of the United States while he continues
                            to reside abroad.</p>
                        <p>I beg to suggest that in the present instance the proceeding would have
                            been greatly simplified and shortened had the legation been promptly
                            advised of Mr. Sorensen’s allegation of United States citizenship, so
                            that the accused could have duly established without delay his right to
                            protection.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I inclose for your information copy of a
                            note from the Danish minister at this capital, under date of the 18th
                            instant, inquiring as to the authenticity and competent issuance of a
                            certificate of naturalization by the county court of Kings County, N.
                            Y., to one Jens Anton Edvard Sorensen, who, having been arrested on
                            charge of violating the military-service law of Denmark, has alleged his
                            American citizenship. I also inclose a copy of my reply to Mr. Brun.</p>
                        <p>The Danish minister’s request implies a purpose to regard this
                            certificate not only as the evidence of acquisition of United States
                            citizenship, which is in fact, but also as the evidence of the holder’s
                            right to protection as a citizen while residing abroad. A passport is,
                            however, the proper prima facie evidence to that end, and I have so
                            intimated to the minister, adding that you would be instructed as to
                            issuing a passport, should the facts warrant it, upon Mr. Sorensen’s
                            application. This course is necessary because, while the fact that Mr.
                            Sorensen acquired American citizenship five years ago appears to be
                            completely established, it is not equally established whether the
                            circumstances of his departure from this country, return, as would
                            appear, to the country of his original allegiance, and residence therein
                            are compatible with his claim to continued protection as a citizen while
                            so residing abroad. These are the facts and circumstances to be
                            ascertained by the legation, taking into account our existing treaty
                            with Denmark.</p>
                        <p>It is much to be regretted that the inquiry has taken this indirect
                            course, as the determination of Mr. Sorensen’s case has thereby probably
                            been needlessly prolonged.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your dispatch No. 153, dated
                            November 28, 1896, relating to the case of Jens Anton Edvard Sorensen, a
                            naturalized citizen of the United States of America, I have the honor to
                            report that I have had a correspondence with him, and subsequently he
                            has called at this legation and presented the usual application for a
                            passport, supported by affidavit, identification, oral examination,
                            court records, and other documentary proofs (which will be forwarded
                            with the regular quarterly report of passports); by all of which I am
                            satisfied that he was born in Varde, Denmark, in 1865, immigrated to New
                            York in <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0153"/>March, 1886, and was
                            duly naturalized as a citizen of the United States on the 20th of
                            October, 1891. He returned to Denmark in August, 1894, bringing with him
                            his wife, whom he had married in America, and two children, both born in
                            that country, for the purpose of making a visit to his family and to aid
                            his mother in settling the estate of his father, who had died the
                            previous year; that while so engaged an aunt of his died in 1895 at
                            Varde, leaving by will the whole of her small estate to him, and he has
                            since been employed in settling the same. I am entirely satisfied from
                            his statement and proofs that he came back to Denmark with the intention
                            of returning to the United States and residing and performing the duties
                            of a citizen therein, and that he would have returned before this but
                            for the circumstances above referred to. The business which has detained
                            him here is now nearly settled, and he states that it is his intention
                            to return to America between this date and the 1st of April next.</p>
                        <p>In August last, whence had been back in Denmark barely two years, the
                            authorities of the town or district of Yarde summoned him to appear for
                            examination for military duty. He appeared and claimed exemption on the
                            ground that he was a citizen of the United States and intended to return
                            to America, and also made some claim of physical disability, and at an
                            adjourned meeting produced his certificate of naturalization (the same
                            referred to in your dispatch No. 153) and demanded that he be released.
                            It appears that the hearing was adjourned and the certificate sent to
                            the ministry of justice in Copenhagen, with an inquiry as to its
                            authenticity, and subsequently, through the ministry of foreign affairs,
                            to the Danish ministry, who referred the inquiry to the Department of
                            State. Sorensen has not since been called before the authorities, but
                            has been informed that he will be held to the performance of military
                            service, and will be called upon for such duty in April next. It is said
                            he is also liable to fine and imprisonment for not having presented
                            himself for such duty at the proper time, though no judgment has yet
                            been pronounced against him to that effect, so far as he knows. It is
                            inferred that the board or tribunal held that the certificate of
                            naturalization was not sufficient evidence of his United States
                            citizenship (as in fact it was not the proper evidence), or that by
                            having returned to and resided in Denmark more than two years he is
                            concluded from asserting his intention to return to the United States,
                            and his citizenship in the latter country is thereby renounced. I have a
                            certified copy of the record of the proceedings of that board, and it
                            states no ground for its conclusion. He is clearly entitled to a
                            passport, unless it be held that the point of renunciation is well
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>The language of the treaty of naturalization of 1872, Article III, last
                            sentence, is far from clear, and so far as I can learn here has never
                            been judicially or officially construed in any case. It seems to me that
                            the reasonable construction is that “more than two years’ residence” may
                            be held presumptive evidence of the nonintention to return, but that
                            presumption may be overcome by proof to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>As above stated, I am entirely satisfied by the evidence that it has
                            constantly been and still is Sorensen’s intention to return to the
                            United States, and that he has been kept here so long only by business
                            which, under the treaty of 1826, a citizen of the United States has a
                            lawful right to carry on, and to reside in this country while
                            transacting it.</p>
                        <p>As it seemed important to Sorensen to have immediate protection, I have,
                            without delaying for reference of the question to the department, issued
                            a passport to him.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your letter, without date, is
                                received, in which you state you wish to be informed whether you yet
                                owe military service to Denmark. You state that you were born at
                                Hjorning, Denmark, January 21, 1867, and in September, 1886, you
                                appeared before the sessions for examination for military duty, and
                                were assigned to such duty in the infantry, but your brother had
                                just returned from America on a visit, and you considered it better
                                to go with him to America than to serve in the army, and did so. You
                                state, however, that before leaving you wrote to the minister of
                                war, asking leave to go, and have been informed that your family,
                                after your departure, received from the minister such leave. You
                                also state that for the last six years you have been a naturalized
                                citizen of the United States.</p>
                            <p>Under these circumstances you ask whether you can safely return to
                                Denmark for a visit of one or two months?</p>
                            <p>I reply that under the laws of Denmark you still owe military duty to
                                the country, and if leave to depart was not actually granted by the
                                minister of war, you would be liable to punishment as a deserter;
                                but in other cases of a similar character, when the returning
                                visitor produced a passport from the United States, showing him to
                                be a citizen of that country, the Danish Government refrained from
                                exacting military duty or inflicting punishment for desertion, and I
                                have little doubt that the same course would be pursued in your case
                                if you should return here on a visit. If you should do so, I advise
                                you by all means to provide <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0155"/>yourself with a passport from the Department of State at Washton
                                before leaving the United States.</p>
                            <p>I forward this through the Department of State.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that I have
                            received a petition from C.N. Lund, who describes himself as president
                            of the Scandinavian Mission of the Mormon Church, accompanied by an
                            affidavit of J. J. Jensen and Joseph Larsen, missionaries, in which are
                            set forth several grievances, and asking my intervention and protection
                            on the ground that they are American citizens.</p>
                        <p>I have no reasons to doubt the truth of the statements contained in these
                            papers, but, in view of the general instruction No. 181 and of the facts
                            complained of being rather of a general policy than of any particular
                            case of pressing urgency, I am not inclined to investigate or take any
                            action until the matter shall have been submitted for your consideration
                            and instruction.</p>
                        <p>As original documents are more forceful than any copy, I inclose said
                            originals, with a respectful request that after consideration they be
                            returned to this legation.</p>
                        <p>I am under the impression that by the vigorous action of the United
                            States Government polygamy has been effectually suppressed; and the
                            provisions of the constitution of Utah and conditions of her admission
                            into the Union as a State, as well as the laws of the United States and,
                            I hope, more enlightened views among the Mormons themselves, render it
                            highly improbable that that system can ever be revived in Utah or
                            elsewhere in the United States, or that even an attempt at such revival
                            is likely to ever be made. Under these circumstances you may think it
                            advisable to reconsider and perhaps modify instruction No. 181.</p>
                        <p>I beg to submit the whole matter for consideration and instruction.</p>
                        <p>I have made no answer to the petition. Indeed, I can not answer, as no
                            address is given; but it is probable that the petitioner intends to call
                            at this legation. If he shall do so before your instructions are
                            received I will inform him of the reference to the department.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As citizens of the United States of
                                America temporarily residing in this country, feeling ourselves
                                aggrieved on account of the treatment received from the officers of
                                the Danish Government, we most respectfully petition your excellency
                                to use your influence in our behalf, that we may be accorded the
                                same protection and privileges under the laws of this country as are
                                given to other foreigners.</p>
                            <p>Representing as we do the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
                                Saints, we desire to state that for the past few years our
                                missionaries have from time to time been subject to arrests and
                                banishment, and that through a procedure which we do not think is
                                warranted under the constitution of this country—that is, they have
                                been summoned to appear before the officers of the law simply to
                                hear the decree of banishment read to them, with a demand for them
                                to leave the country at once, and as a rule they have been escorted
                                out by the police officials, having had no specific charges
                                preferred against them or been given any chance of a defense.</p>
                            <p>If we break any law, we shall not complain if we have to suffer the
                                consequences, but as American citizens who are quietly and peaceably
                                pursuing our labors as missionaries, preaching nothing but the
                                doctrines of Christ and offending no one, we protest against the
                                treatment herein referred to, and we object to being dealt with like
                                criminals and felons without knowing wherein we have offended.</p>
                            <p>We have at present from forty to fifty missionaries laboring in this
                                country, not in a corner, but openly and publicly all over the land,
                                and we are glad to say that in the great majority of cases we have
                                been able to pursue our labors unhindered. Only now and then from
                                some obscure corner of the land we hear of arrests and banishment.
                                We can scarcely believe that it is the intention of the Government
                                in this, our native land, where religious toleration is so well
                                established, to thus deal with us, but are inclined to the belief,
                                as we are also informed, that the complaints against us come from
                                ministers of the gospel in the Church of the State, who may have

                                regard to religion or the interpretation of the Word of God.</p>
                            <p>We have submitted, by affidavit hereunto attached, the facts as they
                                have come to us in the recent case, and earnestly hope that you will

                            <p>We ask for no favors that can not legitimately be accorded to others
                                under similar conditions, but we do desire, and shall insist, that
                                we be permitted to stand on common ground with other foreigners who
                                are sojourning here for similar purposes, and that we shall not,
                                because we happen to represent an unpopular church, be singled out
                                and discriminated against.</p>
                            <p>We fully believe that your excellency, as an honored representative
                                of a great and free Government, will do all in your power to secure
                                its citizens here in the enjoyment of all the privileges that they
                                can lawfully claim, and your humble petitioners and fellow-citizens
                                will be ever grateful.</p>

                            <p>On this 15th day of March, A. D. 1897, before me, Peter M. Flensburg,
                                personally appeared Jens Jorgen Jensen and Joseph Larsen, who, after
                                being duly sworn, severally depose and say:</p>
                            <p>That they are citizens of the United States of America, members and
                                missionaries of the church known as “The Church of Jesus Christ of
                                Latter-day Saints,” and have as such been laboring in Bornholn,
                                Denmark, for more than six months past.</p>
                            <p>That they have not during said period of time solicited pecuniary aid
                                from anyone, but have preached the Word free of charge and made
                                gratuitous distributions of their church literature; that the public
                                gatherings held by them have been conducted in a peaceful and
                                orderly manner; that in conformity with their church rules the
                                doctrine of polygamy has in no instance been advocated by them, and
                                that they have not, so far as their knowledge extends, at any time
                                or in any manner violated the laws of the land.</p>
                            <p>That notwithstanding these facts they were, on the 16th day of
                                February, A. D. 1897, summoned and appeared before the mayor of the
                                city of Bonne, who questioned them regarding their birth,
                                occupations at home and here, citizenship, future intentions, etc.,
                                and thereupon dismissed them.</p>
                            <p>That again, March 1, 1897, they were summoned before the same
                                official, who read to them a decree of banishment issued by the
                                minister of justice, and when asked the cause he stated, “You are
                                Mormon missionaries working for the Mormon Church.”</p>
                            <p>That thereupon they were ordered to take steamer next day for
                                Copenhagen, where upon their arrival they were met by police
                                officials and escorted to the court-house, when after a few hours’
                                detention they were released and commanded to leave the country.</p>
                            <p>That this command was complied with by Jens Jorgen Jensen on March 4,
                                A. D. 1897, and by Joseph Larsen March 10, A. D. 1897.</p>
                            <p>That throughout all these proceedings no specific charge or complaint
                                against them has come to their knowledge, and they have been given
                                no opportunity for defense.</p>

                            dispatch No. 161, of the 4th ultimo, inclosing a petition from Mr. C. N.
                            Lund, who describes himself as president of the Scandinavian Mission of
                            the Mormon Church, accompanied by an affidavit of J. J. Jensen and
                            Joseph Larsen, in which they set forth several grievances and ask your
                            intervention and protection on the ground that they are American
                            citizens.</p>
                        <p>In reply I inclose for your information, as indicating the present
                            attitude of this Government toward Mormon missionaries, a copy of the
                            Department’s instruction No. 46, of June 25, 1895, to Mr. J. Lamb Doty,
                            United States consul at Tahiti; also copy of a letter of June 24, 1895,
                            from Messrs. Woodruff, Cannon, and Smith, “first presidency of the
                            Mormon Church.” The letter in question sets forth the assurance on which
                            the Department based its views that Mormon agents, as the church is now
                            constituted, have the same right of governmental protection as any other
                            law-observing sect of American citizens. If they preach immoral
                            doctrines contrary to the law of the foreign country, intervention on
                            their behalf can not be made; if their teachings and <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0158"/>practices contravene the laws of the

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department has received your
                                dispatch, No. 108, May 11, relative to the position of missionaries
                                of the Mormon Church in Tahiti and the refusal of the local
                                authorities to permit them to preach without special license.</p>
                            <p>In reply you are informed that as long as polygamy was one of the
                                purposes of Mormon teaching, the agents of this Government abroad
                                were instructed to refuse protection to Mormon missionaries. Such
                                repressive action was invited in 1884 especially. (See <ref target="frus1884#pg_10">“Foreign Relations,” 1884, pp. 10</ref>,
                                    <ref target="frus1884#pg_198">198</ref>, etc.) But polygamy is
                                now no longer announced as the chief tenet of Mormonism, and the
                                church has the same civil rights as are enjoyed by other religious
                                bodies in this country. If the Mormon missionaries in Tahiti observe
                                the civil law of marriage, as they profess to do, and preach and
                                practice no doctrine violating law or morality, they should have the
                                same impartial protection as other American citizens enjoy for the
                                defense of their just and lawful rights.</p>
                            <p>The Department can not complain if, in accordance with local
                                regulations, they are forbidden to preach without a license, but it
                                can not acquiesce in the denial of a license for any trivial cause,
                                or at the arbitrary discretion of the authorities. Assuming that
                                they are law-abiding and moral teachers, they should have equal
                                treatment with other propagandists.</p>
                            <p>You are instructed to follow the purpose of this instruction in
                                dealing with this question.</p>

                                worthy medium of your excellency, in order to notify it of the
                                denunciation of the treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation
                                entered into between the two Governments the 8th day of February,
                                1867.</p>
                            <p>In obeying these instructions, I must tell your excellency that this
                                denunciation is based upon Article XXXI of the treaty, and that its
                                object is, therefore, to terminate its effects.</p>
                            <p>I consequently take pleasure in informing your excellency that the
                                Dominican Government entertains the hope that the treaty of 1867
                                will, at no distant day, be replaced by conventions in every respect
                                suited to the present needs of both countries.</p>
                            <p>With this hope, and cherishing the warmest wishes for the stability
                                and greatness of the United States, I have the honor, Mr. Minister,
                                to subscribe myself, your excellency’s most obedient servant,</p>

                            announcing that it is the desire of his Government to terminate, in
                            virtue of article 31, the convention of February 8, 1867, between the
                            United States and the Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <p>Your note having been received on the 13th instant, this Government

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to submit to you some
                            suggestions and some facts in reference to the rights of citizens of the
                            United States in Ecuador, native and naturalized, long resident in this
                            Republic, and respectfully express the opinion that it is a subject
                            which ought to have the attention of the legislative branch of our
                            Government. The same conditions which prevail in Ecuador, I am informed,
                            prevail also in other parts of South America and Central America.</p>
                        <p>There are very few native-born citizens of the United States in Ecuador
                            long resident in this Republic. One has resided in Quito more than
                            twenty years, where all his estate, real and personal, is situated, of
                            which he has a considerable fortune for this country. He is hated by the
                            natives because he is said to be a Jew, and he takes pleasure in
                            calumniating all Americans from the United States, both private citizens
                            and officials, who refuse to accord him social recognition. His
                            commercial connections are almost entirely with European houses. There
                            are a few other citizens of the United States who have resided in
                            Ecuador, where they have lived for periods of ten to thirty years in
                            this Republic, some of them having married here and others raised
                            families without marriage.</p>
                        <p>The naturalized citizens are mainly Germans by birth and Germans still in
                            their love of Fatherland and in their business connections. There are
                            Poles, Russians, Hungarians, and a few French and Irish long resident
                            here, and perhaps never permanently resident in the United States, who
                            claim to be and are naturalized citizens of the United States.</p>
                        <p>It would be difficult for many of these residents to show that they ever
                            intended to return to the United States. They pay no taxes and render no
                            service to the Government of the United States, and they claim exemption
                            from all extraordinary duties and taxes to the Government of Ecuador,
                            and even appeal to the officials of the former Government to be shielded
                            from duties and taxes which are common to all residents in all
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Only a few months since two sons of a prominent and wealthy citizen of
                            Quito went to New York and filed their declaration to become citizens of
                            the United States. One has already returned to Quito and the other is on
                            his return voyage to Quito at this time.</p>
                        <p>The treaty of 1872 between Ecuador and the United States attempts to
                            guard Ecuador against persons born in Ecuador and still resident in this
                            Republic fraudulently obtaining and continuing indefinitely rights as
                            citizens of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Of the latter class there are a few, but of the others, native and
                            naturalized citizens of the United States, there are many, who are
                            permanently located in Ecuador, and certainly never lived in the United
                            States long enough to learn the English language, or have forgotten
                            it.</p>

                        <p>Your 633 received. Proposed increase of duties on pork products, while
                            not understood to discriminate in terms against the United States, is
                            most onerous and virtually prohibitory, operating to close a most
                            important market of supply and to paralyze a mutually beneficial
                            commerce. Timely and considerate remonstrance in a spirit of perfect
                            amity may avert a measure which could not fail to produce a most painful
                            impression in this country.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your telegram in reply to my No. 633,
                            concerning the proposed increase of duty on foreign pork products, was
                            received yesterday morning. A few hours after I met M. Hanotaux and told
                            him of the instructions I had received, and in order to remove from his
                            mind any idea that we were endeavoring to exercise any undue pressure
                            upon him before the French Government had taken a stand in the matter I
                            said that, although your instructions were not intended to be
                            communicated to him, I would send him unofficially a literal translation
                            of the telegram containing them, which would enable him to judge for
                            himself of the considerate and friendly spirit in which they were
                            couched.</p>

                        <p>The same day I sent the translation of your cable, and as there is an
                            interpellation on the question in the Chamber fixed for to-morrow I
                            added to my note of transmittal a few remarks on the fallacy of the
                            argument made by the advocates of the proposed law that foreign
                            importations of pork products had caused a great decline in the prices
                            of home products of the same sort, whereas it is shown by the recent
                            statistical reports that such importations have declined since 1894, and
                            that the falling off in prices complained of is simply the result of
                            overproduction.</p>
                        <p>I also called the minister’s attention to an intimation that it was
                            intended to propose the organization, in France, of a service of
                            microscopical examination inspection of all imported pork products
                            which, if adopted, would not only add to the already heavy duty levied
                            on these products, but would, as far as the United States are concerned,
                            be contrary to our understanding with the French Government that
                            American pork products which are to be exported to France will not be
                            permitted to be shipped without having been previously microscopically
                            examined and stamped accordingly by Government inspectors.</p>
                        <p>I shall inform the Department of the result of to-morrow’s
                            interpellation, in case it should amount to anything.</p>

                            sale of pork products mentioned in my No. 642, of February 26, took
                            place on Saturday last in the Chamber of Deputies.</p>
                        <p>M. Meline, minister of agriculture and president of the council, replying
                            to those who ascribed the depression of French trade in pork products to
                            the large foreign importation, said this depression was mainly caused by
                            overproduction; but he nevertheless declared that when the bill for
                            increasing the duty on foreign pork products came up the Government
                            would favor it, so far as pork butchers’ meat (charcuterie) was
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>M. Gruet, a French deputy, from the Gironde department, stated that the
                            proposed increase of duty would not end the crisis and could be attended
                            with disagreeable consequences, as the United States might retaliate by
                            increasing the duties on French woolens and silks.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the debate the president of the council said that he had
                            in preparation new rules of inspection for pork butchers’ meat
                            (charcuterie) imported from abroad.</p>

                                agriculture, as soon as I received it, that is, on the 27th of
                                February last, the letter you addressed to me on the 25th of
                                February.</p>
                            <p>I thank you for having been kind enough to communicate to me the
                                telegram which Mr. Olney addressed to you, and I have no need to
                                tell you that you will always find the French Government disposed to
                                discuss, in the same sentiments you express, its commercial
                                interests with a friendly nation.</p>
                            <p>I made good note of the considerations which present as to what
                                concerns the inspection of meats.</p>
                            <p>If you have taken the trouble to read the account rendered of the
                                debates of the Chamber, you will have remarked the indications given
                                by M. Meline in regard to the great development of production of
                                which you had on your side pointed out the influence in the

                            <p>The solution which was given to the discussion by the adoption of the
                                order of the day pure and simple, accepted by the Government,
                                appears, besides, of a nature to calm the impressions which this
                                debate has inspired. The declarations of the president of the

                                hasty resolution and which did not take into account the interests
                                of our commerce with the United States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: A few days ago the committee on custom
                            duties of the Chamber of Deputies adopted what is known under the name
                            of” proposition Jonnard,” which makes the following changes in the
                            articles of the tariff concerning pork products: <list>
                                <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 17. Salted pork, hams, and
                                    bacon, 30 francs instead of 25 francs.</item>
                                <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 17 bis. Hog products
                                    (chacuterie), 70 francs instead of 25 francs.</item>
                                <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 30. Lard, 25 francs instead of
                                    14.50 francs.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The committee is composed of members of the majority, which seems to
                            favor any change in the tariff increasing the duty on American meat
                            products. An indication of this feeling is shown in a bill of a rather
                            singular character which was introduced in the House on the 3d
                            instant.</p>
                        <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0165"/>
                        <p>In the argument which precedes this bill it is stated, among other
                            things: That American farmers fatten their hogs on unhealthy detritus
                            and even filth (immondices); that the new tariff scheme of the United
                            States Government ought to attract the attention of the French
                            legislator; that the vote of this scheme is certain and that its effect
                            will be to shut out from the United States nearly all the French goods
                            which are now sold there; and that the only means of preventing the
                            United States from increasing the duty on French goods is to retaliate
                            by imposing higher duties on goods imported from the United States.</p>
                        <p>To that end the bill proposes the following changes:</p>
                        <p>Salted pork, etc., 50 francs instead of 25 francs.</p>
                        <p>Hog products, 80 francs instead of 25 francs.</p>
                        <p>Canned meats, 40 francs instead of 20 francs under the general tariff,
                            and 60 francs instead of 15 francs under the minimum tariff, the one now
                            applied to us according to the agreement of 1893.</p>
                        <p>Meat extracts, 80 francs instead of 40 francs.</p>
                        <p>A separate article provides for doubling the duties on American goods
                            imported into France in case higher duties were charged in the United
                            States on French goods. But it is hardly likely that a bill expressing
                            such extreme views will be taken into serious consideration.</p>
                        <p>I have talked with the most influential members of the ministry about
                            these measures, and feel assured from what they tell me unofficially
                            that the Government will not support these bills and that they are not
                            likely to pass. The progress of all such measures will be carefully
                            watched and any important progress reported.</p>

                        <p>Referring to Olney’s telegram February 24 and Vignaud’s 649, it is
                            learned that proposed doubling of duties on meats and lard is approved
                            by French tariff committee. As this measure means virtual prohibition,
                            it does not stand on the same footing as increased taxation for raising
                            more revenue, which latter is legitimate and imports no national
                            discrimination as the present proposal practically does against a
                            commerce in which the United States is one of the most important sources
                            of supply. You will renew timely and considerate remonstrance against a
                            measure no less onerous to the French consumer than destructive to a
                            large established trade.</p>

                            negotiations, and such action as is apprehended might be a serious

                            attention. Question was to come up to-day, but I had it postponed by
                            making the very point you suggest. I argued it myself with Mr. Hanotaux,
                            whose good will is secured and who will do all he can to have the
                            proposition set aside. It may come up again, however. Pressure on the
                            Government is very great.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since the cable I sent you on the 20th
                            instant in reply to the telegram of the Department concerning the bill
                            introduced in the French Chamber of Deputies for the increase of the
                            import duties on <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0167"/>pork, pork
                            products, cotton oil, etc., I have followed up my previous action with a
                            view to leaving no steps untaken to prevent hostile action here. The
                            bill concerning pork products is the same one mentioned in this
                            embassy’s No. 633, of February 12, 1897. It was somewhat amended in the
                            committee room, and, in its present shape, it proposes the following
                            changes to the tariff in force: <list>
                                <item>Article 12 of the tariff: Pork, 12 francs per 100 kilograms
                                    instead of 8 francs.</item>
                                <item>Article 13: Pigs weighing 35 kilograms or less, 3 francs
                                    instead of 1.50 francs.</item>
                                <item>Article 16, section 2: Pork meat, 18 francs instead of 12
                                    francs.</item>
                                <item>Article 17 <hi rend="italic">bis:</hi> Pork butchers’ meat, 70
                                    francs instead of 25 francs.</item>
                                <item>Article 30, section 2: Lard, 25 francs instead of 14.50
                                    francs.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I have seen many times Mr. Hanotaux and other French officials with
                            reference to this matter, and have endeavored to convince them— <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>That the enactment of a bill introducing such radical changes
                                    in the present rates would undoubtedly be fatal to our
                                    contemplated reciprocity arrangement, and have urged them to
                                    postpone action at least until their new ambassador could reach
                                    Washington and take up the subject of reciprocity anew.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>That the proposition is, in itself, not only unjust, as
                                    leading to the destruction of an important branch of commerce
                                    between our two nations, but also unfriendly in its character,
                                    as it discriminates against the United States.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I know that these arguments have made a serious impression on Mr.
                            Hanotaux and his associates at the foreign office, and that through him
                            and them they have reached the department of agriculture and determined
                            the action of Mr. Meline, the prime minister, in having the proposition
                            adjourned.</p>
                        <p>In his conversation with me on this subject Mr. Hanotaux, however,
                            alluded more than once to the great loss suffered by the French trade in
                            consequence of the sudden substitution of the Dingley tariff for the
                            Wilson Act, and intimated that if the reciprocity arrangement now under
                            consideration could not be brought to a successful termination, it would
                            be impossible to prevent the introduction in the Chamber, and perhaps
                            the adoption of measures affecting more or less some of the American
                            products which the French farmers consider as competing advantageously
                            with their own.</p>
                        <p>On the 19th instant, after the adjournment of the debate on the bill on
                            pork products, four deputies introduced an amendment to that bill
                            providing for an increase of 18 francs per 100 kilograms on cotton-seed
                            oil, which it is proposed to tax 24 francs instead of 6 francs. The
                            amendment was referred to the committee.</p>
                        <p>The manufacturers of soap in France, who use a great deal of pure cotton
                            oil, are now appearing before the committee and arguing against an
                            increase of tariff on that article, but those engaged in the business of
                            manufacturing oil from seeds are bringing all the pressure they can in
                            favor of the increased tariff on our oil.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cambon, the new ambassador to the United States, will not sail until
                            about Christmas.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: The attention of the
                            department of foreign affairs has been called by Mr. Schneider, director
                            of the French Creusot Company, to an action at law brought by him
                            against the American Carnegie Company for the illegal manufacture of
                            iron plates and for the violation of a patent issued to the inventors in
                            1889 by the Patent Office at Washington. The Federal Navy Department
                            having concluded contracts with the Carnegie Company for the manufacture
                            of these same plates, and having consequently become interested in this
                            case, has, it appears, espoused the cause of said company in a wholly
                            abnormal manner. Mr. Schneider complains of the irregularity of this
                            official intervention in a private suit, and of the injury that it does
                            him by compelling him to seek, before the courts at great expense, the
                            settlement of a matter which might otherwise have been amicably and much
                            more speedily arranged.</p>
                        <p>Before laying the case before your Department, as my Government has
                            instructed me to do, I thought proper to request Messrs. Pollok &amp;
                            Mauro, counsel at Washington for the Creusot Company, to furnish some
                            information on the subject. You will find inclosed a copy of the letter
                            which I have received from them, and which contains a full statement of
                            the case. It appears from this statement that evidence of the official
                            pressure complained of by the interested parties is furnished by a
                            report recently made to the United States Senate by its Committee on
                            Naval Affairs, in which that committee criticizes such official pressure
                            as improper.</p>
                        <p>The report in question bears date of February 11, 1897, and its number is
                            1453. On page xii are the following words: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Messrs. Schneider &amp; Co. earnestly complain, not merely
                                    because the Navy Department does not pay them a royalty on their
                                    patents, but because it virtually makes the Government a party
                                    to a suit to destroy their patents for all purposes
                                    whatever.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The report adds (pp. xxxi and xxxii) that Mr. Herbert, then Secretary of
                            the Navy, having considered the question, decided that it would be
                            proper to compromise, but that no agreement as to the amount to be paid
                            to Messrs. Schneider &amp; Co., as compensation for the use of their
                            invention, was reached during his incumbency of office.</p>
                        <p>The Senate Committee on Naval Affairs concludes as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>These armor plates were deemed indispensable by Secretary Tracy
                                    and continue to be so considered by Secretary Herbert, but the
                                    plan adopted by Secretary Whitney of paying for their use was
                                    abandoned. A fund of $270,000 was provided by order of Secretary
                                    Tracy for contesting the validity of the patents, and the

                                <p>The committee believe that Government officials ought not to

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In reply to your communication of the
                                29th ultimo, requesting further particulars in the matter of the
                                suit brought by Messrs. Schneider &amp; Co., of Creusot, France,
                                against the Carnegie Steel Company, of Pittsburg, for infringement
                                of patents granted by the United States to Mr. Henri Schneider for
                                making nickel-steel armor, we have the honor to call your attention
                                to a report of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, dated February
                                11, 1897 (Report No. 1453), in which the details of this affair are
                                fully set forth.</p>
                            <p>Inasmuch as the report is a voluminous document, containing many
                                matters foreign to the subject of your inquiry, we will give a brief
                                summary of the pertinent facts.</p>
                            <p>(1) The Government of the United States, having confidently obtained
                                the information that a new armor of theretofore unknown resistance
                                had been invented by Messrs. Schneider &amp; Co., obtained a plate
                                from the inventors and had the same tested at Annapolis in
                                September, 1890. These tests produced a revolution in the naval
                                armament of the world.</p>
                            <p>(2) Mr. Schneider had in the meantime applied for letters patent of
                                the United States for the invention, and the Secretary of the Navy,
                                Mr. Tracy, deemed it of such importance to the public service that
                                he made official request to the Secretary of the Interior to
                                expedite the examination of the application and the issuance of the
                                patent, which was issued November 19, 1889.</p>
                            <p>(3) Mr. Carnegie, of Carnegie, Phipps &amp; Co. (now the Carnegie
                                Steel Company), who had been negotiating with Mr. Tracy, then the
                                Secretary of the Navy, for a contract for making armor, on learning
                                the result of the Annapolis tests, immediately proceeded to London
                                and negotiated, through correspondence, a license from the owners of
                                the Schneider patents, and agreed to pay a royalty of 2 cents per
                                pound of armor for the right to use the invention. No formal
                                contract was made. With this preliminary arrangement Mr. Carnegie
                                secured a contract from the Navy Department, dated November 20,
                                1890, for about 6,000 tons of armor. The contract is printed in the
                                said report of the Senate committee, beginning at page 15.</p>
                            <p>In this contract was a clause for which we believe there is no
                                precedent in this or any other country, and which has had the effect
                                of prejudicing the interests (vested by the grant of letters patent
                                of the United States) of citizens of France. In this clause it is
                                provided that the Government may require the armor to be made of
                                nickel-steel in accordance with the invention patented to Messrs.
                                Schneider &amp; Co., and in order to relieve the Carnegie Company,
                                who had obligated them <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0170"/>selves to pay 2 cents per pound royalty to the patentees, the
                                Secretary of the Navy, to the injury of the patentees (who were not
                                parties to the contract and knew nothing of these matters),
                                expressed a doubt as to the validity of the patents, and set aside a
                                large sum of money—about $270,000—to be expended by the Carnegie
                                Company, aided by the power and influence of the Government, to
                                contest the patents in the courts. (See page xiii of report.)</p>
                            <p>We do not refer to other particulars, as they do not affect the
                                present situation.</p>
                            <p>(4) The Carnegie Company proceeded to execute this contract, and in
                                so doing violated the rights which the Government of the United
                                States had granted to Messrs. Schneider &amp; Co.</p>
                            <p>Subsequently the Government made other contracts with the Carnegie
                                Company for many thousand tons of armor, but in these new contracts
                                the clause above referred to, and which guaranteed the contractors
                                against the claim for royalties under the Schneider patents, was not
                                included. For the royalties for armor made under these latter
                                contracts the manufacturers were themselves responsible to the
                                patentees, the Government having no liability therefor.</p>
                            <p>In due course a suit was brought by Schneider &amp; Co. for recovery
                                of the royalties due to the former for the use of their patented
                                invention. It will be understood that the Government, by its
                                contract of November 20, 1890, with the Carnegie Company, rendered
                                itself liable for the royalties upon the armor made under the later
                                contracts.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding that this suit embraces royalties for the greater
                                part of which the Government has no liability, the Navy Department
                                undertook the defense of the suit, and to pay all the expenses
                                thereof out of the funds set aside as above stated. In this
                                proceeding the public funds are used to contest the validity of the
                                grant of the Government, and to destroy, if possible, the rights
                                which it has vested and pledged itself to secure. If it were
                                possible understand the attitude of the Government with respect to
                                the claim of the patentees, upon armor made under the first
                                contract, it would not be possible to understand its attitude with
                                respect to royalties for armor made under later contracts, for which
                                the Government is not liable.</p>
                            <p>(5) The Carnegie Company, aware of the danger to which they were
                                exposed, notwithstanding the Government guaranty, in accumulating a
                                large indebtedness to the patentees, were negotiating with Messrs.
                                Schneider &amp; Co. for a settlement, but were constrained by the
                                position taken by the Government averse to the patents, as above
                                stated, and by reason thereof the negotiations have been fruitless.
                                (See testimony of Secretary Herbert, p. 10 of report, first
                                paragraph.) It thus results that up to the present time the
                                patentees have received no compensation whatever for the extensive
                                use of their invention by the Carnegie Company.</p>
                            <p>(6) On May 12, 1896, we addressed to the Navy Department a
                                communication pointing out the injustice of the attitude toward
                                Messrs. Schneider &amp; Co., as patentees of the United States
                                Government, and the impropriety of the interference of the
                                Government in a civil suit brought under the grant of the Government
                                and to enforce the rights guaranteed by it. We requested that the
                                Government withdraw from said suit and either adjust the matter (so
                                far as it was concerned) amicably with Messrs. Schneider &amp; Co.,
                                or refer it to the Court of Claims. For a fuller statement of this
                                matter we refer your excellency to that letter, which is printed in
                                the committee report beginning at page xxix.</p>

                            <p>The Senate committee, commenting on this subject in their report (p.
                                xii), say: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>Messrs. Schneider &amp; Co. earnestly complain, not merely
                                        because the Navy Department does not pay them a royalty on
                                        their patents, but because it virtually makes the Government
                                        a party to a suit to destroy their patent for all purposes
                                        whatever.</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>The then Secretary of the Navy (Mr. Herbert), on consideration of the
                                matter thus brought to his notice, decided that it would be proper
                                to compromise (see pp. xxxi and xxxii), but no agreement as to the
                                amount to be paid to Messrs. Schneider &amp; Co. as compensation for
                                the use of their invention was reached during his incumbency of
                                office.</p>
                            <p>(7) After full inquiry into these matters the Senate committee, in
                                its report with reference to the “Schneider patent processes for
                                compounding nickel-steel,” say (p. xiii): <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>These were deemed indispensable by Secretary Tracy, and
                                        continue to be so considered by Secretary Herbert, but the
                                        plan adopted by Secretary Whitney of paying for their use
                                        was abandoned. A fund of $270,000 was provided, by order of
                                        Secretary Tracy, for contesting the validity of the patents,
                                        and the litigation is still pending.</p>
                                    <p>The committee believe that Government officials ought not to
                                        promote a monopoly of the business of making armor through
                                        patents issued to the use of the combined manufacturers
                                        while using the power of the Government to destroy the

                                </quote></p>
                            <p>The United States Government has never in its history interfered in a
                                civil suit to defend against a patentee suing under his grant from
                                the Government. The good faith of the Government is pledged to
                                protect its patentees in the enjoyment of the exclusive rights
                                granted by the act of the Government, and under the laws of the land
                                the Federal courts are required to exercise the power of the
                                Government to protect and enforce the rights of its patentees
                                against infringers, and this has uniformly been done throughout the
                                history of the Government until the present case arose. This
                                departure from the uniform and just treatment which the United
                                States Government has accorded to its patentees is made in the case
                                of French citizens who, confiding in the laws of the United States,
                                brought forward their invention and communicated it in confidence to
                                the authorities of the United States at such time as to render this
                                Government a signal service by preventing the adoption of an
                                inferior type of armor which has since been everywhere
                                discarded.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, we would say that it would be gratifying to our
                                clients and to ourselves if, through the intervention of your
                                excellency, the Government of the United States should be induced to
                                pay due regard to the rights of Messrs. Schneider &amp; Co. under
                                their patent, and to preserve neutrality in the suit between them
                                and the Carnegie Company.</p>
                            <p>With the assurances of our highest regard, etc.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: Referring again to your note of the
                            9th ultimo, I have the honor to inform you that, as appears from the
                            letter of the Secretary of the Navy, bearing date the 8th instant, his
                            attention had already been called by the counsel of Messrs. Schneider
                            &amp; Co. to the legal proceedings <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0172"/>brought to test the validity of letters patent granted
                            to that firm for the manufacture of nickel-steel armor plate.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency will be gratified to know that proceeding is an ordinary
                            suit pending in a court of the United States in which the rights of all
                            parties are thoroughly guarded, and in which the interests of the
                            plaintiffs, Messrs. Schneider &amp; Co., who are citizens of the French
                            Republic, will be as fully and impartially protected as would be the
                            case if they were citizens of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The action of this Government in intervening in order to protect its own
                            interests in the suit of Messrs. Schneider &amp; Co. is precisely what
                            it would be were the plaintiffs citizens of this country.</p>
                        <p>In November, 1890, a contract was entered into between the Carnegie
                            Company and the United States, represented by Mr. Benjamin F. Tracy,
                            then Secretary, of the Navy, for the manufacture of armor plate. This
                            contract provided for the incorporation of nickel in the armor. Messrs.
                            Schneider &amp; Co. had been granted letters patent by the United States
                            for making steel armor, but Mr. Tracy had doubts as to the validity of
                            those letters.</p>
                        <p>It were needless to say that the grant of letters patent by Government is
                            never a guaranty of their validity, were it not that the attorneys of
                            Messrs. Schneider &amp; Co., in their letter to your excellency of the
                            14th ultimo, in speaking of the Schneider patent as “a grant of the
                            Government,” conveying “the rights which it (the Government) has vested
                            and pledged itself to secure,” and also your excellency in speaking at
                            the close of your note of “the rights which the Federal Government
                            guaranteed to him (Schneider) in 1889 by granting to him a patent,” seem
                            to imply that the grant of letters patent is a guaranty of their
                            absolute validity. It is, on the contrary, well settled that a patent is
                            not an absolute grant which a Government is bound to warrant and defend,
                            but only a conditional grant, a prima facie title, sometimes called a
                            mere right, to sue for alleged infringement, the condition being that it
                            is invalid and nugatory if it shall appear that the patentee is not the
                            original inventor, etc. The United States having granted a patent is,
                            therefore, not only at liberty, but is bound to refuse to pay royalties
                            under the same if it prove invalid. So, for instance, the late Secretary
                            of the Navy, representing this Government, contracted to pay a large sum
                            of money to an American patentee for a projectile, but made the contract
                            conditional upon the validity of the patent, which the United States
                            itself had already granted.</p>
                        <p>It was, therefore, plainly the duty of Mr. Tracy, in the case in
                            question, to protect the United States from the payment of a royalty in
                            the event that the Schneider patents should prove to be invalid. Any
                            other action on his part would have been a neglect of duty. The royalty
                            claimed by the patentee was 2 cents per pound of armor, and it was
                            therefore provided in the contract between him and the Carnegie Company
                            that 2 cents per pound of armor manufactured according to his process
                            should be deposited to await the test of the validity of the patent. If
                            invalid, or in the case of an amicable settlement, the balance of said
                            amount remaining after such settlement and payment of legal expenses, as
                            provided in the contract, was to be returned to the Government; if
                            valid, said amount was to be used to pay the judgment, costs, and
                            expenses, and if all was required to pay the judgment, then the United
                            States was to pay certain expenses of the Carnegie Company, including
                            reasonable attorney’s fees.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to see the slightest ground for criticism of the action
                            of Mr. Secretary Tracy. On the contrary, it appears to have been the <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0173"/>ordinary precaution of a
                            prudent man and faithful official, who honestly believed that his
                            Government was liable to be subjected to a large, invalid claim. The
                            Carnegie Company, in making their contract at a fixed price for
                            nickel-steel plate, insisted on being protected against a claim for the
                            above-stated royalty by reimbursement of all damages thereby accruing.
                            Mr. Secretary Tracy very properly agreed that they should be so
                            reimbursed, but he further provided, with equal propriety, that if the
                            claim for the royalty should, upon being tested, turn out to be an
                            invalid one, the United States should be relieved from making any such
                            reimbursement, except to the extent of the cost of making the test.</p>
                        <p>The case stands exactly as it would if at the time there had been a half
                            dozen patentees claiming various rights in respect to such manufacture,
                            and a general clause had been embodied in the contract between the
                            United States and the Carnegie Company that, in addition to the price
                            for the armor, there should be compensation for whatever sum should be
                            judicially determined to be due from Carnegie &amp; Co. to any of said
                            patentees, and that there should also be added the fees and expenses
                            which that company might be obliged to pay in testing the validity of
                            such patents.</p>
                        <p>An omission of a provision of this kind would have been an inducement to
                            the Carnegie Company to pay all such claims, without testing their
                            validity, and then look to the United States for reimbursement. It is
                            not easy to see how the case is made any stronger for Messrs. Schneider
                            &amp; Co. by reason of the fact that in this instance the amount
                            reserved was a definite sum, amounting to $270,000, instead of an
                            indefinite, unlimited sum.</p>
                        <p>As to the employment of counsel by this Government, what other course
                            could it appropriately take in justice to itself It bound itself to
                            reimburse the Carnegie Company in case the patents should be declared
                            valid, and as some $200,000 are involved, this Government would be
                            derelict in its duty if it did not take care of its rights. It is the
                            courts alone that can decide whether the Schneider patents have been
                            infringed. If they are valid, they certainly will be sustained; if not,
                            the United States should not pay for them. This Government stands
                            exactly as any individual would under the same circumstances. It
                            exercises no influences and takes no action that would not be permitted
                            to any individual under similar condition. Consequently it is difficult
                            to understand the infelicitous suggestion contained in the letter of
                            Messrs. Pollok &amp; Mauro to your excellency, that the “power and
                            influence of the Government are to be used in the pending suit of
                            Messrs. Schneider &amp; Co. <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. The Carnegie
                            Company.” This Government does not wish to believe that it was intended
                            to say that any Government, that of the United States or that of France,
                            because powerful or influential, should not defend itself against an
                            invalid claim, or that either of them would make improper use of its
                            power or influence in the conduct of judicial proceedings in its own
                            courts.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. Pollok &amp; Mauro say that “the United States Government has
                            never in its history interfered in a civil suit to defend against a
                            patentee suing under his grant from the Government. The good faith of
                            the Government is pledged to protect its patentees in the enjoyment of
                            the exclusive rights granted by the act of the Government.” I have the
                            honor to suggest in reply that in the case of The United States <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. The American Bell Telephone Company, this
                            Government filed a bill in equity to repeal and declare void letters
                            patent which it had granted. A little further inquiry on the part of the
                            attorneys of Messrs. Schneider <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0174"/>&amp; Co. would have informed them that in a suit brought by
                            Grosvernor et al. (American citizens) <hi rend="italic">v</hi>.
                            Dashiell, in the United States circuit court for the district of
                            Maryland (62 Federal Reporter, 584), the Government took an active part,
                            as appears from the reports of this case, when tried before the circuit
                            court and when heard on appeal before the Supreme Court of the United
                            States (162 U. S. Reports, 425), and that the interests of this
                            Government were represented by Mr. Samuel F. Phillips,
                            ex-Solicitor-General of the United States. The foregoing case is
                            especially in point, as the defendant, who was charged with infringement
                            of a patent upon improvements in breech-loading cannon, had (as had the
                            Carnegie Company) made a contract with the United States to be paid a
                            stipulated sum for the guns manufactured embodying the infringing
                            device.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of the Navy has further been informed by the law officer of
                            his Department that research by the attorneys of Messrs. Schneider &amp;
                            Co. would have revealed that the reports of cases decided by the United
                            States Court of Claims contain numerous instances in which the
                            Government has defended itself against suits for alleged infringement by
                            itself of patent rights. In this connection, I have the honor to call
                            the attention of your excellency to the suit now pending before that
                            court, brought by Messrs. Pollok &amp; Mauro for the Société Anonyme des
                            Anciens Etablissements Cail, a French company claiming reimbursement for
                            the use, by the Government, of the De Bange gas check for ordnance. It
                            is difficult to see any distinction between a case in which the
                            Government directly defends itself against such a suit and one where it
                            defends a suit in which its interests are involved, although it be not a
                            nominal party thereto.</p>
                        <p>Reference to the Senate report of February 11, 1897, No. 1452, which is
                            voluminous, containing some 25 printed pages of matter for the most part
                            alien to the present inquiry, and upon which your excellency’s note is
                            in part based, will show that the facts therein stated are in accord
                            with those herein set forth. It is true that the report contains one
                            expression of opinion which may be regarded, to some extent, as a
                            criticism of the action of the officials of this Government. It is,
                            however, general rather than specific, and is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The committee believe that Government officials ought not to
                                    promote a monopoly of the business of making armor through
                                    patents issued to the use of the combined manufacturers while
                                    using the power of the Government to destroy patents held by
                                    foreigners.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Whether this opinion has any bearing at all on the matter in question, or
                            is warranted by the facts, can best be determined by a consideration of
                            them and of the whole report. Even as a matter of abstract opinion, that
                            committee would probably agree to the propriety of nullifying any
                            patent, whether held by a citizen of this country or by a foreigner, if
                            it were not a valid one.</p>
                        <p>It is not the opinion of this Government that the contract and the suit
                            in question differ in any essential particular from an ordinary contract
                            or an ordinary suit. Nor can this Government agree with the suggestion
                            that it has acted in the premises otherwise than with entire propriety
                            and due regard to the protection of its interests and those of its
                            citizens, and without unfair treatment of the rights of any foreign
                            citizens. It fails to see any reason why the matter should be made the
                            subject of diplomatic correspondence, but feels assured that, after the
                            foregoing presentation of facts, your excellency will readily agree that
                            this suit, like any other, should be left to the courts. Instead of <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0175"/>appealing to diplomatic
                            intervention for an adjustment of the rights of their clients, a much
                            more direct course for Messrs, Pollok &amp; Mauro to pursue would be to
                            go on with the prosecution of the claim in the courts, where it will not
                            fail to receive the justice and to secure the success which it may
                            merit.</p>
                        <p>From the foregoing recital, your excellency will, I feel assured, clearly
                            understand that this Government has not intervened in this instance, in
                            a cause pending in the courts solely between American and foreign
                            citizens, but the case being one in which its own interests are at
                            stake, has simply taken the necessary and proper steps to care for those
                            interests in compliance with the contract which was solemnly entered
                            into for that purpose. Your excellency will therefore, I am sure, not
                            press the request that the United States “will no longer be a party to
                            the suit brought by Mr. Schneider.” While this Government is not a party
                            upon the record of the court, it is the real party in interest, and to
                            ask it to cease to be such, would be asking it to submit to a claim
                            which it has reason to believe is not a valid one. Such a request, if
                            made by one of its own citizens, would be extraordinary, and citizens of
                            a foreign country can hardly expect privileges in such a matter that are
                            not granted to citizens of the United States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It frequently happens that American
                            citizens of French origin apply for reliable information concerning
                            their position in regard to the French military and nationality laws. In
                            view of such inquiries I send the following report, which may interest
                            the Department as well as enlighten those having any concern in the
                            matter, if it is deemed advisable to make it public.</p>
                        <p>Various communications from this embassy have acquainted the Department
                            with the different provisions of the French law on nationality, of June
                            26, 1889, which is the only one applicable to the cases now under
                            consideration. I refer particularly to Mr. Reid’s No. 29, of July 16,
                            1889 (<ref target="frus1890#pg_276">Foreign Relations, 1890, p.
                                276</ref>), and to my Nos. 513, of April 7, 1892 (<ref target="frus1893#pg_295">Foreign Relations, 1893, p. 295</ref>), and
                            47, of August 22, 1893 (<ref target="frus1893#pg_303">Foreign Relations,
                                1893, p. 303</ref>).</p>
                        <p>It is proposed now to inform more fully the Department with regard to the
                            official construction of the clause of that law which relates to
                            naturalization in connection with military service and to the manner it
                            is applied to American citizens of French origin.</p>
                        <p>According to that clause, Article 17 of the Civil Code is now made to
                            declare that a Frenchman naturalized abroad does not cease to be French
                            if he is still subject to military service in the active army, unless
                            his naturalization was obtained with the consent of the French
                            Government. Nothing in the law indicates whether this clause is to be
                            applied to those who had failed to discharge their military obligations
                            before the law was passed, or simply to those who had committed that
                            offense after the law was enacted. The language, also, of the law is <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0176"/>not very explicit with regard
                            to what is meant by the “active army.” The period of service in that
                            army is only for three years, but from the active army every Frenchman
                            passes first into the reserve, in which the period of service is seven
                            years, after which period he is transferred to the territorial army. Was
                            it to be understood that the period during which a Frenchman can not
                            renounce French citizenship without the consent of his Government
                            embraced the whole time during which his military services were due in
                            both the active army and the reserve of that army?</p>
                        <p>The ruling of the French Government in the cases submitted to its
                            consideration by this embassy have settled these points, and it is now
                            possible to state the exact meaning of the law according to the French
                            Government, and what the position is of a Frenchman naturalized abroad
                            without the consent of his Government, before having been discharged
                            from the French active army.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the meaning of the law it is understood now: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>That it has a retroactive effect; it applies to those who have
                                    avoided military service and acquired another nationality before
                                    as well as after the law was enacted.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>That the words “active army” mean both the active and the
                                    reserve of the active army, and</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>That the expression “If he is still subject to military
                                    service,” is to be understood as applying to the date at which
                                    the naturalization was obtained.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Under this construction the law is made to have the following effect: The
                            Frenchman naturalized abroad without the consent of his Government, who
                            at the date of his naturalization was still subject to military service
                            in the active army or in the reserve of the active army, remains French,
                            and as such is amenable to the military laws of France.</p>
                        <p>Not having responded to the notice calling him to accomplish the three
                            years’ military service which every Frenchman has to perform, he is
                            placed on the list of those charged with insoumission—noncompliance with
                            the national military laws—and if found under the jurisdiction of
                            France, whatever his age may then be, or whatever the number of years he
                            has lived abroad, even if he left France in his tender infancy, and even
                            if he was born abroad, provided his father was French at the time, he is
                            arrested and tried as an insoumis, and after such trial turned over to
                            the active army or to the reserve of the active army or to the
                            territorial army, according to his age.</p>
                        <p>When a Frenchman has passed the age during which he may be called to
                            serve in the active army or its reserve—that is to say, when his name
                            has been transferred from the muster roll of that army to that of the
                            territorial army—he does not need the consent of his Government to be
                            lawfully naturalized, abroad; and when naturalized in the United States
                            under such conditions an application from this embassy secures, without
                            difficulty, the recognition of his American citizenship, provided this
                            application is accompanied by the naturalization papers of the person in
                            whose behalf it is made and by an American passport. The production of
                            the passport is not absolutely necessary and can be dispensed with, but
                            the original papers of naturalization or an authentic copy of the same
                            must be produced.</p>
                        <p>Before or after his naturalization abroad a Frenchman may ask his
                            Government its consent to renounce French national character, but if he
                            is of the age during which active military service is due, this consent
                            is never given, or given only under very exceptional circumstances. <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0177"/>I do not know of any successful
                            application of that character. This consent is, on the contrary, usually
                            given to those who, having passed the age of service in the active army
                            and its reserve, can only be called to do service in the territorial
                            army, although their naturalization may have taken place while still
                            belonging to the active army.</p>
                        <p>Applications of this kind should be made direct to the minister of
                            justice by the interested parties and must be accompanied by a fee of
                            1.75 francs and by a statement giving all necessary particulars
                            concerning the applicant. When granted it is in the shape of a decree
                            signed by the President and countersigned by the minister of justice and
                            another high official. I inclose herewith a copy of the form used in
                            such cases. This decree is then communicated to the minister of war, who
                            directs that the name of the person concerned be erased from the
                            military lists of the French army, as being no longer French, and who
                            informs that person of his action.</p>
                        <p>It is the rule of this embassy to decline making any application of this
                            kind in behalf of those who are already in possession of their full
                            American papers of naturalization, as such a step might imply an
                            improper admission on our part. But it does not refuse its good offices
                            to those who desire to secure the consent of their Government before
                            having been naturalized.</p>
                        <p>I add here a synopsis of the principal cases of naturalization submitted
                            to the French Government by this embassy since the adoption of the law
                            of 1889. Many other cases of this kind have been brought to its notice
                            and became the subject of much correspondence, but were not presented to
                            the French Government.</p>

                                the United States at the age of 13. Naturalized October 30, 1888,
                                through his father, and again December 29, 1892, being then of age.
                                Notice reaches him in the United States in February, 1893, to join
                                the regiment to which he had been assigned. Case submitted to the
                                French Government March 22, 1893, under instruction from the
                                Department. Rejected May 23, 1893, on the ground that a man of
                                French birth can not assume another nationality before having
                                complied with the military laws of France, unless he obtains
                                permission from his government to do so, a permission which is
                                refused to Poidebard on the ground that it would be an encouragement
                                to young Frenchmen to have themselves naturalized abroad in order to
                                escape from military service in France.</p>

                                the United States in 1882. Fails to present himself, and is placed
                                on the list of those charged with insoumission (noncompliance with
                                the military laws). Naturalized April 17, 1893. Applies to this

                                citizenship by the French Government. Case submitted July 17, 1893.
                                Rejected August 29, 1893, on the ground that being under the charge
                                of insoumission he must stand his trial before the question of
                                citizenship can be taken into consideration.</p>

                                submitted May 25, 1893. Rejected July 15, 1893, on the ground that
                                naturalization abroad can not divest of his national character a

                                United States in 1886. Naturalized November 8, 1894, while still
                                belonging nominally to the reserve of the active army. Visits France
                                in 1896, with an American passport issued by the State Department,
                                and applies to this embassy to have his American citizenship
                                recognized. At that time Giron had passed the age of service in the
                                reserve. Case submitted July 4 and July 20, 1896, with the remark
                                that it was similar to the one of Papot, whose American citizenship
                                had been recognized. Case rejected September 29 on the ground that
                                the case of Papot had been erroneously decided; that it was held now
                                by the war department that when on the date of his naturalization a
                                Frenchman still belonged to the active army his naturalization was
                                void with regard to French law, and that consequently Giron was
                                still French. If, however, he would procure from the minister of
                                justice the permission provided by law to change his allegiance the
                                war department, upon the production of that permission, would have
                                his name struck off from the French military rolls. Giron procured
                                the permission, produced it before the war department, and on July
                                24, 1897, his American citizenship was admitted to.</p>

                            but was brought to the United States when he was an infant, where he has
                            ever since resided, until, having recently returned to France on a
                            visit, he was arrested and is now held in a military prison in Châlon,
                            France, the French Government claiming that he is a citizen of France,

                            became an American citizen under the name of Bennett, and who was

                            his money, and asks whether he can not hold the French Government

                            passage to New York. I have replied to him that, acting under your

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I recently reported (No. 51, of July 24)
                            that according to a letter addressed to the consul-general by Mr.
                            Hubinoit-Bennett he had been discharged by the French military
                            authorities and that he had expressed the intention of claiming an
                            indemnity from the French for his arrest and confinement during over a
                            month. I have since received a note from the minister of foreign affairs
                            in reply to the one from this embassy laying the case before him, and
                            Hubinoit himself has called. Mr. Hanotaux simply states that by order of
                            the general commanding the Sixth Army Corps Hubinoit had been set at
                            liberty. But the statement of Hubinoit and the papers which were given
                            to him by the military authorities show that he has simply been
                            acquitted of a charge of insoumission (noncompliance with the military
                            laws) and that, as I suspected, he is still held to be French. Having

                            was placed on the list of reserves, and a military book (livret
                            militaire) was furnished to him showing that he will belong to that
                            reserve until the year 1905, and that permission is given to him to
                            proceed to Pittsfield, United States, where any military notice will

                        <p>The case of Hubinoit is therefore hardly changed. He can no longer be

                            which this whole matter is explained, it will be seen that there is only
                            one way for Hubinoit to have his American citizenship recognized by the
                            French Government; it is to apply for the necessary permission to change
                            his allegiance, permission which is not likely to be refused under the
                            circumstances, but which will cost 175 francs.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch, No. 51, of the 24th ultimo,
                            in further relation to the case of the American citizen Hubinoit,
                            otherwise known by the name under which he was naturalized, to wit,
                            Bennett, has been received. Mr. Hubinoit makes inquiries whether he can
                            not obtain indemnity for time lost and return passage to New York, and
                            you have replied to him that you had fulfilled your instructions in
                            asking for his discharge, but that without further instructions you
                            could not present the claim he mentions.</p>
                        <p>Your response to Mr. Hubinoit’s inquiry was discreet and proper. It is
                            not recalled that the solicited discharge of an American citizen from
                            military duty in a foreign country has been followed by a successful
                            claim or reparation for actual loss and injury sustained. Certainly no
                            claim of exemplary damages has been preferred. As a general thing the
                            interested party is satisfied with his release from the embarrassing
                            situation in which he had been placed by his inadvertent return to his
                            original jurisdiction, and this is especially so when there is probable
                            cause for proceedings against him, as in the present instance, when the
                            naturalization of Mr. Hubinoit under another name required somewhat
                            elaborate proof to establish his asserted identity.</p>
                        <p>There have, however, been instances where a foreign government has
                            graciously compensated a person erroneously detained and released, for
                            actual loss of time or money, and if the circumstances of the present
                            case appear, in the judgment of the embassy, to warrant an informal
                            suggestion to the French Government in this regard, it is possible that
                            it might be taken into kindly consideration without formal admission of
                            liability in the premises.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to invite your
                                attention to certain facts in relation to the French prohibition of
                                American cattle and meats, which may be useful as a basis for the
                                representations which you have instructed the American ambassador to
                                make concerning this subject.</p>
                            <p>Beginning with the year 1877 a large export trade was established by
                                our merchants in bacon and hams, the exports to France being in that
                                year over 23,000,000 pounds. By activity in the introduction of
                                these excellent meat products the trade had increased in 1881 to
                                over 68,000,000 pounds. Then came the French decree prohibiting the
                                further importation of American pork. This decree was made without
                                any evidence to show that any inhabitant of France had been
                                injuriously affected by eating American pork, or any evidence to
                                show that the trichinae which this pork was alleged to contain were
                                alive in the cured meat, which alone was shipped to that country. As
                                a result of this prohibition the large trade which had been
                                established at much expense; was at once utterly destroyed.</p>
                            <p>After many protests and the establishment of a microscopic inspection
                                in this country of pork for export, the prohibition was removed, to
                                take effect January 1, 1892. It was supposed by this Government that
                                the withdrawal of the prohibition would give our exporters an
                                opportunity to again enter the French markets and regain the trade
                                which had been ruined eleven years before by the action of the
                                French Government. Unfortunately, the decree withdrawing the
                                prohibition established regulations which were scarcely less
                                oppressive to the trade than the prohibitory decree. In its
                                correspondence with the Department <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0182"/>of State, this Department protested against these
                                regulations in the following language: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>After a thorough inspection has been made by the Government
                                        of the United States, it is unjust and unreasonable to
                                        require our shippers to pay the expense of another
                                        inspection at the French ports. This tariff and these
                                        inspection charges will result in a prohibition as absolute
                                        as the decree which has just been revoked.</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>Again, under date of February 10, 1892, a further protest was made by
                                this Department as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose
                                        for your information a translation of the instructions of
                                        the French Government to the veterinary inspectors who are
                                        charged with the sanitary inspection of salt pork from the
                                        United States. The paragraphing and numbering of the
                                        paragraphs have been done in this Department for convenience
                                        of reference, but otherwise the translation is a literal
                                        one.</p>
                                    <p>An examination of these regulations shows that they are
                                        unnecessarily burdensome to our shippers, and that the trade
                                        in pork products can not be expected to prosper if they are
                                        enforced. In the first place, no pork is admitted unless
                                        thoroughly used. The standard for thoroughly cured meats
                                        must be an arbitrary one, and under this provision any or
                                        all of our meats may be rejected or the trade may be
                                        harassed and rained by a few unfriendly inspectors. The only
                                        object in requiring such meat to be thoroughly cured is to
                                        guard against the danger from trichinae, but this Government
                                        has established an expensive system of microscopic
                                        inspection to remove this danger, and it was in
                                        consideration of this inspection that the prohibition was
                                        removed. Our inspected pork should, therefore, be admitted
                                        without regard to the degree of salting if it is undamaged
                                        and free from taint.</p>
                                    <p>The extreme injustice of these regulations is seen more
                                        particularly by reference to paragraph 6. Notwithstanding
                                        the fact that all insufficiently cured meat is refused
                                        entrance, there is here a provision that all meat which the
                                        inspector may consider to be insufficiently cured shall be
                                        submitted to a microscopic examination. Why should our
                                        shippers be put to the expense and delay caused by a
                                        microscopic inspection of pork which under no circumstances
                                        will be admitted into France? If the meat is refused
                                        entrance that should end the matter and the shipper should
                                        be allowed to forward his consignment at once to more
                                        friendly markets. But to hold the meat which has already
                                        been refused entrance for a microscopic examination, to
                                        destroy such of this as the inspectors believe to be
                                        infected with trichinae, and then to reject all that is not
                                        found affected, is a wanton outrage which should not be
                                        submitted to by this Government.</p>
                                    <p>Again, in paragraph 8 it is provided that meats in brine
                                        shall be considered insufficiently cured, and shall be
                                        rejected if the brine is not of a certain arbitrary degree
                                        of density. This also is an unjust and unreasonable
                                        requirement. If the meat is free from taint or damage, it is
                                        perfectly wholesome; and to reject it because the brine does
                                        not reach an arbitrary standard of density is a
                                        discrimination against this country which can not be
                                        justified on sanitary or other grounds.</p>
                                    <p>In this connection I beg to call the attention of your
                                        Department to the condition of trade between France and the
                                        United States. In 1878 the balance of trade was, in round
                                        numbers, $12,000,000 in our favor; in 1879 it was
                                        $39,000,000 in our favor; in 1880 it was $31,000,000 in our
                                        favor; in 1881 it was $24,000,000 in our favor. In 1882 came
                                        the prohibition of our pork products and a more pronounced
                                        attitude against our trade, and we find the balance of trade
                                        reversed, and instead of being in our favor, it suddenly
                                        turns nearly $39,000,000 against us. From 1882 to the
                                        present the balance of trade has been steadily unfavorable,
                                        varying from $10,000,000 to nearly $40,000,000 a year. In
                                        1891 it was $17,000,000 against us.</p>
                                    <p>These facts show how much more favorable our laws and
                                        regulations have been for the maintenance of French trade
                                        than those of France have been for the encouragement of
                                        American trade.</p>
                                    <p>As our exports to France consist chiefly of agricultural
                                        products, I feel free to say that in my opinion this
                                        condition of the trade should be taken into account, and a
                                        determined effort should be made to secure such
                                        modifications of the French regulations as will develop our
                                        exports to that country and make them equal to the imports.
                                        If the French Government is unwilling to meet such a demand
                                        and remove its unreasonable and unjust discriminations
                                        against our shippers, then this Government owes it to our
                                        people to enforce the remedy which Congress has already
                                        provided for such cases.</p>

                            <p>In March, 1892, Messrs. Armour &amp; Co., of Chicago, stated in a
                                letter to this Department that while “in Germany the trade is going
                                on well, as far as France is concerned, we, as well as many others,
                                have abandoned the business entirely.”</p>
                            <p>The harsh and injurious regulations referred to in this
                                correspondence were continued, and our exporters were subjected to
                                so many annoying decisions that they have practically abandoned the
                                field, and this country has never regained, and there is no prospect
                                of its regaining, the trade which was destroyed by the prohibitory
                                decree of 1881. The following table shows the exports of hog
                                products to France for the years from 1875 to 1882, inclusive, and

                                1892 are still in force, this Department having received no
                                information to the contrary, and in case they are still maintained
                                that a protest be entered against restrictions limiting the trade to
                                thoroughly cured pork, against any inspection fees being imposed,
                                against the arbitrary rejection of meat on account of lack of
                                density in the brine when the meat is in good condition, and against
                                the destruction of shipments of meat which are refused

                                opportunity of establishing a large trade. In that year 5, 184 head
                                were shipped. In the next year this trade had continued to grow and
                                10,538 head had been exported to that country up to February, 1895,
                                when the traffic was prohibited. Protests have been made against
                                this prohibition without avail. It has been shown that there are no
                                contagious diseases of cattle in this country liable to injure the
                                domesticated animals of France, but even if that were not the case,
                                it is customary for nations which are disposed to be friendly toward
                                the trade of other countries to at least allow animals to be brought
                                to the frontier ports or seaport towns for immediate slaughter. The
                                importation of cattle for this purpose can be guarded so that there
                                is no possible danger of the spread of any contagion, and the proof
                                of this is the fact that from 300,000 to 400,000 head of cattle are
                                annually sent to Great Britain and slaughtered in this manner
                                without the introduction of disease.</p>
                            <p>I would request that you instruct the American ambassador to protest
                                against the prohibition of live animals from this country, and to
                                ask that either such animals he admitted freely to France, or that
                                in case there is any fear from a sanitary point of view, that at the
                                very least our cattle and sheep for slaughter should be allowed to
                                land at <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0184"/>the principal ports
                                for slaughter within a reasonable period, say at any time within two
                                weeks from the date of landing.</p>
                            <p>In October, 1896, a special concession was made by the French
                                Government with the purpose of allowing the transportation of
                                American cattle across the French territory destined for Basel,
                                Switzerland. This concession, which at first appeared to have been
                                made with the intention of assisting American shippers, although in
                                reality there was no market for American cattle in Switzerland, was
                                afterwards found to be hedged in by such restrictions that even if
                                there had been a market in Switzerland and our shippers had been
                                ever so desirous of reaching it, they could not have shipped by the
                                route indicated. The regulations mentioned require, first, that
                                there shall be a certificate delivered by the proper authorities
                                attesting that the animals do not come from States in which Texas
                                fever is prevalent; secondly, that the certificate shall also state
                                that there has been no contagious disease for six months prior to
                                their shipment in the place from which they have come; thirdly, that
                                the cattle have been held in a Government quarantine station for at
                                least forty-five days before shipment; and fourthly, that they shall
                                have been put to the tuberculin test before shipment.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding these certificates and this quarantine and this
                                tuberculin test, it is required that a French veterinarian shall
                                accompany the animals in their trip across the Atlantic, and during
                                their transit across French territory until they reach the Swiss
                                border, the said veterinarian to be compensated by the owners of the
                                cattle, and finally, these export cattle shall not be allowed to be
                                placed in any train having cars of French cattle. The impossibility
                                of shipping cattle under such regulations is apparent at a
                                glance.</p>
                            <p>The fact is, that since 1881 the exporters of American animals and
                                meats have been practically shut out of the French markets. These
                                are among the largest items of our export trade, and they are the
                                ones which it would be of the most benefit to our agricultural
                                population to have exploited. During these years there have been no
                                prohibitions against French produce, and no unjust sanitary
                                regulations have been enforced. There have been no discriminations
                                against French trade, so far as I am aware, but her merchants have
                                been given the same favorable consideration that has been extended
                                to the merchants of other countries. It would be unjust to our own
                                people to continue very much longer to give these facilities to
                                French trade while such important branches of American trade are
                                unjustly prohibited.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to request, therefore, that you will instruct the
                                American ambassador to place this matter fully before the French
                                Government, and to urge that the injurious regulations and
                                prohibitions referred to shall be favorably modified at an early
                                day. The friendly relations which have so long existed between
                                France and the United States should insure an immediate settlement
                                of this question upon a satisfactory basis.</p>
                            <p>Very respectfully,</p>

                            transmitted to the Department in his No. 169, of October 19, 1896, a
                            copy of the following communication made to him by the French
                            resident-general in Madagascar, September 15, 1896: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Consul</hi>: Madagascar has become a
                                    French colony. A decree of the 9th of June organizes the
                                    judiciary. Foreign subjects will hereafter be amenable thereto.
                                    The <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0187"/>Government of the

                                <p>I have therefore the honor to make known to you that, beginning
                                    with the 16th of October, our tribunals will exercise their
                                    functions over all your nationality, and from now on will
                                    entertain, on their part, all suits and actions.</p>

                                    your consular court may be by it wound up, but after that date
                                    the consular courts can no longer take cognizance of new cases,
                                    nor further count on our cooperation to assure their working and
                                    execution of their sentences.</p>
                                <p>I seize this occasion to renew to you, etc.,</p>
                                <p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">Hippolyte Laroche.</hi></p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>On May 4, 1896, the consul was instructed by cable, at the instance of
                            the French ambassador here, to “suspend until further instructed
                            exercise consular judicial functions in all cases where cooperation of
                            an established French court is available for disposition judicial cases
                            affecting American citizens.”</p>
                        <p>It appears from the consul’s reply, dated October 5, 1896, to the above
                            quoted note of the French resident-general, that the consul, acting
                            under the telegraphic instructions of May 4, had ceased temporarily the
                            exercise of his judicial functions, and had informed the French
                            resident-general that he would so suspend the exercise of judicial
                            powers in all districts where the cooperation of an established French
                            court was available for the disposition of judicial cases affecting
                            American citizens. The consul goes on further to say that in pursuance
                            of this instruction he had permitted no new case to be entered upon his
                            court calendar after receipt of that telegram. The Department is not
                            informed and can not draw from the consul’s dispatch a clear inference
                            as to whether he continued to exercise his judicial authority in winding
                            up the pending court business after the receipt of the telegram. In the
                            absence of competent French tribunals he might properly have done
                            so.</p>
                        <p>The establishment of French sovereignty and civil jurisdiction over the
                            Island of Madagascar puts an end to the extraterritorial rights of the
                            United States in that country, and to the judicial powers of our consul
                            dependent thereon. This changed condition is assumed to have gone into
                            effect on the 16th of October, when, according to the statement of the
                            French resident-general, the French courts were to have been opened for
                            business. It does not appear from the communications received from the
                            consul—nor from those received from the French Government—what
                            provision, if any, was made for the disposition of the cases and other
                            pending matters which the consul may have been unable to finally
                            adjudicate and dispose of before his judicial authority became extinct.
                            Did these unfinished matters abate ab initio, or has provision been made
                            for their transfer to the proper French tribunals for complete
                            adjudication?</p>
                        <p>It is hoped that the French Government has taken care that the lawful
                            rights of citizens of the United States shall not be lost or prejudiced
                            in the transition from extraterritorial to French jurisdiction. I am,
                            etc.,</p>

                            concerning the cases pending on October 16, 1896, before the American
                            consular court in Madagascar, I have to report that I am in receipt of a
                            note from Mr. Hanotaux stating in reply to an inquiry from this embassy
                            that the instructions of the minister of colonies to the French
                            resident-general are to the effect that all facilities should be given
                            to the consuls for settling the cases brought before their courts before

                                communicate to the minister of the colonies the letter by which, on

                            pertinent annex from the United States consul at Tamatave, reporting a
                            notification of the French resident-general, under date of April 3,
                            1897, whereby all holders of <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0189"/>concessions granted by the Malagasy Government are “invited” to
                            produce to the resident-general, or the provincial resident, a copy of
                            their concession or title deeds within two months from the date thereof,
                            and to make certain particularized statements in regard thereto, under
                            penalty of forfeiture of their rights.</p>
                        <p>This Government could not regard such a notice as valid or binding upon
                            American citizens who may have obtained concessions or acquired real
                            property in Madagascar, inasmuch as it appears to be a purely
                            administrative procedure, lacking the most elementary forms of judicial
                            administration. It is observed that in default of the parties furnishing
                            the information demanded of them and of their placing themselves “in
                            accord with the local residents “(whatever that may mean), the parties
                            in interest are to be considered as renouncing their concessions, and it
                            is added that the Government will dispose thereof at the risk and peril
                            of such parties.</p>
                        <p>This announcement is of so singular a character, that it behooves this
                            Government to invite, through you, the attention of the French
                            Government thereto, and to advert particularly to its failure to comply
                            with the elementary requirements of justice and equity, so far as it
                            might affect the rights of any citizen of the United States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Tour instruction No. 10, of May 29, to
                            General Porter, directed him to call the attention of the French
                            Government to the singular character of a notice issued by the French
                            resident-general in Madagascar, whereby all holders of concessions
                            granted by the Malagasy Government are asked to produce a copy of their
                            concessions within a specified time, under penalty of forfeiture. This
                            instruction was complied with in a written communication dated June 16,
                            and on the 29th of the same month Mr. Hanotaux informed this embassy
                            that it had been referred to Mr. Lebon, minister of the colonies. I am
                            now in receipt of another letter from Mr. Hanotaux, dated July 22,
                            stating that Mr. Lebon considers the notice referred to as being of a
                            general character, and as having no other object in view but to
                            establish the validity of the concessions in question. This measure,
                            says the minister of colonies, can in no way affect property regularly
                            acquired; it would be applied with great impartiality, and it is
                            calculated to be to the advantage of those who can show that their title
                            is regular and that they have complied with the conditions stipulated in
                            their contract.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Ambassador</hi>: As I said in my letter of
                                the 26th of June last, I had placed before the minister of the
                                colonies your excellency’s communication of the 16th of the same
                                month concerning a notice published by the residency-general of
                                France in Madagascar on the 3d of the preceding April, which
                                requested the holders of concessions granted by the Hova Government
                                to produce, within a prescribed time, before the French authorities
                                a copy of their titles under penalty of forfeiture.</p>
                            <p>Mr. A. Lebon has just informed me that the object of this order, the
                                requirements of which are of a general character, is to enable the
                                local administration to complete the data which it already possesses
                                as to <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0191"/>the manner in which
                                were passed, and then executed, the contracts relating to the

                                in the large island before our occupation.</p>
                            <p>The requirements which are in question have, therefore, no other end

                                contained in their contract.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received your dispatch No. 50, of
                            July 24, inclosing a copy of Mr. Hanotaux’s note relative to the notice
                            issued by the French resident general in Madagascar, inviting holders of
                            concessions granted by the Hova government to produce within two months
                            copies of their title deeds, under penalty of forfeiture of their
                            rights.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hanotaux explains that the object of this order is to enable the
                            local administration to complete the data which it possesses relative to
                            concessions granted by the Hova government to French citizens and
                            foreign colonists settled in the island before French occupation. He
                            states that “the requirements which are in question have no other end
                            than to establish the validity of the said concessions, and would
                            therefore not affect property acquired in a regular manner.”</p>
                        <p>It is added that the inquiry will be conducted with the greatest
                            impartiality to all interested, whatever their nationality.</p>
                        <p>While Mr. Hanotaux’s note is calculated to remove to some extent the
                            impression made upon the Department by the text of the notice referred
                            to, his treatment of the matter is somewhat vague.</p>
                        <p>The Department appreciates the desire of the French Government to obtain
                            complete data in regard to concessions made by the Hova Government to
                            foreigners in Madagascar, prior to French occupation, and it is hoped
                            that Americans holding concessions will promptly furnish the information
                            desired. But this Government can not admit the right of the French
                            Government, in the event of the noncompliance of any American citizen
                            with the order in question, to treat his concession as forfeited or
                            subject to disposition by that Government. As stated by me in my
                            previous instruction: “This Government could not regard such a notice as
                            valid or binding upon American citizens who may have obtained
                            concessions or acquired real property in Madagascar.” In the language of
                            Mr. Hanotaux: “The requirements which are in question would not affect
                            property acquired in a regular manner.”</p>
                        <p>If your former note to Mr. Hanotaux did not make the position of this
                            Government in this matter entirely plain, you should take occasion to do
                            so now.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully, yours,</p>

                            Cable Company (Compagnie Française des Câbles Télégraphiques) finds it
                            necessary to add a supplementary cable to that which it already has
                            between Brest and Cape Cod. It consequently requests me to transmit, in
                            its name, the inclosed application to the Federal Government, with a
                            view to obtaining the various facilities for the landing of this second
                            cable that were granted in 1879 to the French Paris and New York
                            Telegraph Company (Compagnie Française du Télégraphe de Paris à
                            New-York), whose rights of ownership were transferred to it in 1895 by
                            an authentic instrument of conveyance, in due form.</p>
                        <p>This submarine line, which was established eighteen years ago, has been
                            worked since that time in pursuance of an authorization granted by the
                            President of the United States to the original concessionnaires November
                            10, 1879. The inclosed application reproduces in detail the terms on
                            which this permission to land was then granted by the Federal
                            Government, which remitted the custom-house formalities in the case of
                            the vessel which carried the cable and the material, and likewise
                            certain duties in the ports of the State of Massachusetts.</p>
                        <p>The only cable which has hitherto been used by the French Telegraph Cable
                            Company has now become very defective, in consequence of long usage. The
                            frequent breaks which it has suffered have occasioned various
                            interruptions of its service, to wit, ten months in 1895, eight months
                            in 189b, and two months and nine days early in the present year. It is
                            therefore a matter of great importance to remedy the insufficiency of
                            the first cable by the establishment of a second.</p>
                        <p>The two American submarine lines which connect the United States with
                            France have two cables each. The companies owning those lines have
                            received from the French telegraph department all desirable facilities
                            for the establishment and management of these double lines. In view of
                            this reciprocity, the Government of the Republic feels confident that
                            the Federal Government will be pleased to comply with the request of the
                            French company in a manner that will enable it speedily to secure the
                            regular transmission of its telegraphic communications in such a way as
                            will be equally advantageous to our two countries.</p>

                                explanatory details:</p>
                            <p>The cable from Brest to Cape Cod which we now use belonged originally
                                to the French, Paris and New York Telegraph Company. It was laid in
                                1879, in pursuance of authority granted by the President of the
                                United States. The application to this effect was drawn up on the
                                24th of October, 1879, by M. de Chauvin, the said company’s agent at
                                New York, and was transmitted to the Hon. William M. Evarts,
                                Secretary of State of the United States, by Mr. Outrey, then
                                minister of France at Washington. In that document, a copy of which
                                you will find herewith, the company requested permission to “lay,
                                land, and use its cable or cables,” and also to land its material
                                (in case of bad weather or if its vessel arrived on Sunday) without
                                the ordinary customs formalities; finally it requested the remission
                                of the dues payable by the vessel having the cable on board if it
                                was obliged to enter any port of the United States on the coast of
                                Massachusetts.</p>
                            <p>These various requests were complied with on certain conditions,
                                which were accepted by the French, Paris and New York Telegraph
                                Company. These conditions are enumerated in a memorandum of the
                                Federal Government bearing date of October 27, 1879, which is
                                likewise inclosed with this application, together with a copy of a
                                subsequent letter, dated November 10, 1879, whereby the Hon. Mr.
                                Evarts officially informed Mr. Outrey of this decision.</p>
                            <p>The cable between Brest and Cape Cod was used by the French, Paris
                                and New York Telegraph Company until January 1, 1895, when it became
                                the property of the French Telegraph Cable Company. An authentic
                                copy of the instrument whereby this transfer was made, certified by
                                the United States consul-general at Paris, was filed at the embassy
                                of France at Washington and at the consulate-general of France in
                                New York.</p>
                            <p>As I stated at the beginning of this communication, the cable in
                                question has, owing to long usage, suffered injuries which render it
                                very defective. Long interruptions of telegraphic communication have
                                been the result, especially during the years 1895 and 1896 and early
                                in 1897. These interruptions, which lasted six months in 1895, eight
                                months in 1896, and two months and nine days in 1897, have entailed
                                not only a loss of business, which has been detrimental to the
                                company, but also considerable expense for repairs. The
                                establishment of a second cable is consequently a matter of urgent
                                necessity. The French Telegraph Gable Company, having acquired the
                                rights of the French, Paris and New York Telegraph Company, now has
                                the honor to solicit for the landing of its second submarine cable
                                the facilities and exemptions from customhouse requirements that
                                were granted in 1879 to the original concessionaires. To this effect
                                it is prepared to renew the engagement with the Federal Government
                                entered into by the company, whose place it has taken, and to submit
                                to the various requirements stated in the memorandum of October 27,
                                1879, to which reference has been made above.</p>
                            <p>The steamer having the cable on board will, in all probability, be
                                able to land its material at Cape Cod early in June. The company
                                which I represent would be very grateful to the Federal Government
                                if it would kindly notify the customs a thorities of Massachusetts
                                in <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0194"/>due time and send them
                                the necessary instructions, to the end that the landing in question
                                may take place just as it did in 1879.</p>
                            <p>In accordance with the mode of procedure observed at that time, I
                                have the honor to transmit this application to you through the
                                representative of the French Republic at Washington.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of your note of the 7th instant, transmitting in authentic
                                form the acceptance by the Compagnie Française du Télégraphe de
                                Paris à New-York, of the conditions deemed essential by this
                                Government to its grant of a permission to that company to land its
                                cable on the shores of the United States. You assure me at the same
                                time on behalf of your Government that the authorization granted in
                                France to the Compagnie Française du Télégraphe de Paris a New-York
                                does not involve any exclusive privileges, and that the conditions
                                imposed on that company by its undertaking with the French
                                Government will be made applicable by that Government to any other
                                company, whether French or foreign and recognized as solvent, which
                                shall apply for the privilege, for the right of landing.</p>
                            <p>I have without delay brought the subject, together with the
                                information conveyed by your note, to the attention of the
                                President, and he authorizes me to say that, in view of the
                                assurances thus received from the French Government, that reciprocal
                                privileges of landing will be granted by France to any company which
                                may be formed by citizens of the United States upon the same terms
                                that these privileges are granted <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0195"/>to the present or any future company of French
                                citizens that may apply for such landing privileges, and having also
                                received the acceptance by the directors of the Compagnie Française
                                du Télégraphe de Paris a New-York of the conditions prescribed by
                                this Government, the executive permission of the Government of the
                                United States will be granted to that company to land its cable at
                                Cape Cod, in the State of Massachusetts.</p>
                            <p>It is proper for me to add, however, that this executive permission
                                is to be accepted and understood by the company as being subject to
                                any future action of Congress in relation to the whole subject of
                                submarine telegraphy, as explained in my note to you of the 27th

                            <p>In compliance with the suggestion of your note of the 24th of
                                October, I will take pleasure in requesting the Secretary of the
                                Treasury to give such orders to the local customs officers at Boston
                                as will permit the landing of the cable in advance of the regular

                                with danger to the success of the enterprise.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The French Paris and New York
                                Telegraph Company, whose representative in America I have the honor
                                to be, was organized early this year under the French laws.</p>
                            <p>The capital of the company is 52,000,000 francs, 42,000,000 of which
                                form its capital in shares. These shares have been issued, have all
                                been subscribed for, and the fourth and last payment will be due
                                January 1, 1880.</p>
                            <p>The 10,000,000 supplementary francs are, according to the present
                                plan, to be obtained by means of bonds as soon as possible, so as to
                                permit the company to lay another cable during the summer of the
                                coming year.</p>
                            <p>The lines of the company, when finished, will comprise trans-Atlantic
                                cables as follows: From Brest to St. Pierre; from England to St.
                                Pierre; from Brest to England; from St. Pierre to Cape Cod; from St.
                                Pierre to Cape Breton. An overland line from Cape Cod to New
                                York.</p>
                            <p>This latter line was built for the company which I represent by the
                                American Union Telegraph Company of New York. The same company, has,
                                moreover, purchased the land at Cape Cod which is necessary for the
                                landing of our cable. A contract has been concluded between the
                                American Union and my company for the exclusive exchange of
                                telegraphic correspondence.</p>
                            <p>The work of making and laying our cables has been intrusted to
                                Messrs. Siemens Brothers, of London, England.</p>
                            <p>My company has secured from the French Government a concession for
                                landing and working its cables, and a copy of said concession and
                                other official documents relative to the organization of my company
                                has already been transmitted to your Department.</p>
                            <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0196"/>
                            <p>I, consequently, have the honor, in the name of my company, to
                                solicit the permission of your Government to the end that it may be
                                authorized to lay, land, and work, as a foreign company, its cable
                                or cables on the coasts of the United States, the point at which the
                                company proposes to land its cable being Cape Cod, in the State of
                                Massachusetts.</p>
                            <p>In case my request is favorably received by your Government, I will
                                add an additional respectful request, viz, that permission may be
                                granted to the vessel or vessels charged with the laying of the
                                cable to land their cargo before the regular custom-house
                                formalities have been complied with, in case these vessels arrive on
                                Sunday, or just before a storm, in order that a delay may thus be
                                avoided which might prove disastrous to our enterprise.</p>
                            <p>A similar favor has been granted to the direct cable company, and I
                                have the honor herewith to enclose a copy of the letter containing
                                the instructions given under those circumstances.</p>
                            <p>I further take the liberty to request that the Department of State
                                will kindly remit, as was done for the direct cable company, all
                                charges that would otherwise be payable by the steamer having the
                                cables on board, if that vessel should be obliged to enter any
                                United States port on the coast of Massachusetts.</p>
                            <p>In case of a favorable decision by your Government, my company is

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of May 4, 1897, in which you inclose an application
                            made by the French Telegraph Cable Company, as successors of the French
                            Paris and New York Company, to lay a supplementary cable to that which
                            it already has between Brest and Cape Cod.</p>
                        <p>The existing cable was laid under permission granted by the President of
                            the United States in 1879, subject to the action of Congress and to
                            certain conditions. Without discussing the question of his authority to
                            grant that permission, I have the honor to inform you that the present
                            Executive does not regard himself as clothed, in the absence of
                            legislative enactment, with the requisite authority to take any action
                            upon the application which you present. A bill was introduced in the
                            last Congress giving the President of the United States express
                            authority to authorize the landing of submarine cables on the shores of
                            the United States, subject to conditions therein specified, but it
                            failed to become a law. Until Congress shall see fit to clothe the
                            President with power to act in matters of this kind, he will be
                            compelled to refrain from doing so.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: In connection with my note of the
                            11th ultimo, concerning the application of the Trench Telegraph Cable
                            Company to lay a supplementary submarine cable to that which it already
                            has between Brest and Cape Cod, I have now the honor to state that,
                            according to representations which have recently been made to the
                            Department, the steamer <hi rend="italic">Dacia</hi>, from Calais, has
                            arrived at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, with the avowed purpose of landing
                            the shore end of the new French cable. It is also represented that the
                            superintendent of that company at Cape Cod lately inquired of counsel at
                            Boston as to the landing rights of the company on the shores of
                            Massachusetts.</p>
                        <p>In view of the statements made in my note that the President did not feel
                            himself authorized, in the absence of legislative enactment to that end,
                            to grant the application of the French Cable Company, I can only say
                            that it is the expectation of the Federal Government that that company
                            will take no steps toward laying its proposed cable from Cape Cod
                            without express authorization of the President or of Congress, before
                            which, as I have observed to you, a bill was introduced at the last
                            session, but which has not yet been enacted into law. If that company
                            should, however, take action in the manner proposed, it is proper to say
                            that it would do so at its peril.</p>
                        <p>Asking that these views be immediately made known to the proper agent of

                            considerable delay, to submit to you now, with a view to the prevention
                            of unfortunate misunderstandings, certain observations which have been
                            suggested to me by the perusal of these two communications.</p>
                        <p>For greater clearness, and at the risk of repetition, I will briefly
                            recall the origin of the matter which has served as a basis for this
                            exchange of communications.</p>
                        <p>In 1879 the French Telegraph Company from Paris to New York, of which the
                            French Telegraph Cable Company is now the legal heir, received authority
                            from the President of the United States to land at Cape Cod a submarine
                            telegraph cable intended to connect America and France. This telegraph
                            cable, like all submarine cables, the working of which becomes
                            impossible after a certain number of years, unless a second cable is
                            added which renders it possible to make good the inevitable breaks in
                            the first one, allowed, in the opinion of those who laid it, the
                            subsequent addition of a supplementary cable. In other words, once in
                            possession of the concession which had been granted it, and the duration
                            thereof not being limited, the company thought that it had an
                            incontestable right to avail itself of the practical means of utilizing
                            said concession, and it still holds this opinion. The American lawyers
                            whom it has consulted since then have confirmed it in the view
                            originally taken by it. If the case were otherwise, the right to operate
                            the line, which was granted to it in 1879, and which has been in no
                            respect impaired since that time, would, in fact, become illusory.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances—the necessity of a supplementary cable having
                            been superabundantly demonstrated—the company, as you are aware,
                            addressed the Department of State on the 3d ultimo, making application,
                            in view of the speedy lauding of the said supplementary cable, for the
                            various facilities (exemption from customs duties, etc.) <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0199"/>which had been granted when the first
                            cable was laid. It was informed in reply that— <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>In the absence of legislative provisions on the subject, the
                                    present Executive did not consider himself invested with the

                                    to this application, and that, until Congress should see fit to
                                    invest the President with power to act in questions of this

                            in consideration of the concession granted it in 1879, decided to
                            proceed in the ordinary way to the performance of the operations which
                            had become indispensable to the continuance of the working of its line.
                            The usual formalities for the landing of the cable had been complied
                            with by it, when I received your note of June 4, the object of which was
                            to advise it that, in the absence of a special authorization from the
                            President or the Congress, the work which it proposed to do would be
                            done at its peril. I have transmitted this note to the representative of
                            the company at New York, but its receipt has not yet been
                            acknowledged.</p>
                        <p>I received last evening (Saturday, June 5) your second note, requesting
                            me to inform the company that it must discontinue the work of landing
                            the cable until it had received a special authorization either from the
                            President or from Congress. I have likewise forwarded the latter note to
                            the agent of the French Telegraph Cable Company at New York. This order
                            to discontinue the work, which is hardly reconcilable with the
                            declaration of incompetency contained in your note of May 11, seems to
                            me, in a legal point of view, to call for certain observations which you
                            will allow me to formulate here. The company has violated no law of the
                            United States, so far as I know, at least. It does not propose to
                            establish a new telegraph line, for which it might require a previous
                            authorization. The supplementary cable which it desires to lay is
                            designed solely to assure the operation of an old line which it
                            possesses in virtue of the authority granted by the President in 1879.
                            The prohibitory measures with which it is now threatened seem, under
                            these circumstances, to be scarcely justifiable. They would be the less
                            justified inasmuch as the two American companies whose submarine lines
                            connect the United States with France have obtained from the French
                            Government all desirable facilities for operating their double
                            cable.</p>
                        <p>I take the liberty to submit these views to your impartial consideration,
                            trusting that they may contribute toward preparing the way to an
                            amicable settlement of this matter.</p>
                        <p>Be pleased to accept, etc.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On May 4, 1897, the French ambassador
                            submitted to your Department the application of the French Company of
                            Telegraphic Cables (the successor of La Compagnie Française du
                            Télégraphe de Paris à New-York) for permission to land a cable
                            supplementary to that which it has between Brest and Cape Cod, upon the
                            same terms and conditions as those which were imposed by the President
                            in 1879, when the original cable was landed.</p>
                        <p>On May 11, 1897, your Department replied to this request, saying: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The present Executive does not regard himself as clothed, in the
                                    absence of legislative enactment, with the requisite authority
                                    to take any action upon the application which you present. A
                                    bill was introduced in the last Congress giving the President of
                                    the United States express authority to authorize the landing of
                                    submarine cables on the shore of the United States subject to
                                    conditions therein specified, but it failed to become a law.
                                    Until Congress shall see fit to clothe the President with power
                                    to act in matters of this kind, he will be compelled to refrain
                                    from doing so.</p>

                        <p>On June 4, 1897, your Department addressed a note to the French
                            ambassador, calling his attention to the fact that it had been
                            represented to the Department that a steamer from France had arrived at
                            Cape Cod with the avowed purpose of laying the shore end of the new
                            cable, and saying: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>It is the expectation of the Federal Government that that company
                                    (the French Cable Company) will take no steps toward laying its
                                    proposed cable from Cape Cod without express authorization of
                                    the President or of Congress before which, as I have observed to
                                    yon, a bill was introduced at the last session, but which has
                                    not yet been enacted into law. If that company should, however,
                                    take action in the manner proposed, it is proper to say that it
                                    would do so at its peril.</p>

                        <p>On June 5, 1897, another note was sent, informing the French ambassador
                            of advices received to the effect that about 1,000 feet of the new
                            French cable had been laid at Cape Cod the day before, and saying:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Before taking any further action in the matter, I request that

                                    be correct, to immediately desist from its work pending the
                                    necessary authorization either of the President or of

                        <p>The French ambassador’s notes, two of the 5th and one each of the 6th and
                            8th of June, disclose the fact that, although the Department’s notes of
                            the 4th and 5th of June had been promptly forwarded to the company’s
                            agent, the work of landing the cable had been completed before their
                            receipt.</p>
                        <p>In view of the situation outlined, and the fact that Congress has not
                            acted upon the matter, you request an official expression of my views as
                            to the power of the President, in the absence of legislative enactment,
                            to control the landing of foreign telegraphic cables.</p>
                        <p>What the President can do and ought to do in the case of projected cables
                            may possibly be ascertained from what he has done; at any rate, a
                            recurrence to the history of the landing of certain existing cables may
                            prove of service in considering the question you propound.</p>
                        <p>The first cable from a foreign country landed upon the shores of the
                            United States was one connecting the island of Cuba with the State of
                            Florida, and was landed in 1867, under supposed authority of the act of
                            Congress of May 5, 1866 (14 Stat., 44), granting to the International
                            Ocean Telegraph Company, a New York corporation, the sole privilege, for
                            fourteen years, of laying and operating telegraphic cables from the
                            shores of Florida to Cuba, the Bahamas, and other West India islands,
                            upon these conditions, namely, the United States to have the free use of
                            the cable for military, naval, and diplomatic purposes; the company to
                            keep all its lines open to the public for the daily publication of
                            market and commercial reports and intelligence; all messages to be
                            forwarded in the order received; no charge to exceed $3.50 for messages
                            of ten words, and Congress to have the power to alter and determine the
                            rates (Forty-ninth Congress, second session, Senate Doc. No. 1–2, p. 63;
                            letter of Mr. Frelinghuysen to the President, January 27, 1885.)</p>
                        <p>In 1869 a concession was granted by the French Government to a company
                            which proposed to lay a cable from the shores of France to the United
                            States. One of the provisions of this concession gave to the company for
                            a long period the exclusive right of telegraphic communication by
                            submarine cable between France and the United States. President Grant
                            resisted the landing of the cable unless this offensive monopoly feature
                            should be abandoned. The French company accordingly renounced the
                            exclusive privilege, and the President’s objection was withdrawn. The
                            cable was laid in July, 1869; it ran from Brest, France, to St. Pierre,
                            a French island off the southern coast of Newfoundland, thence to
                            Duxbury, Mass., and was known as the “First French Cable.” It soon
                            passed, however, into the control of the Anglo-American Company,
                            controlling the cables connecting Great Britain with this continent.

                            the French and British ministers, Mr. Fish said: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    Congress may impose. In the absence of legislation by Congress,
                                    I was unwilling, on the one hand, to yield to a foreign state
                                    the right to say that its grantees might land on our shores
                                    while it denied a similar right to our people to land on its
                                    shores; and, on the other hand, I was reluctant to deny to the
                                    great interests of the world and of civilization the facilities
                                    of such communication as were proposed. I therefore withheld any
                                    resistance to the landing of the cable, on condition that the
                                    offensive monopoly feature of the concession be abandoned, and
                                    that the right of any cable which may be established by
                                    authority of this Government to land upon French territory and
                                    to connect with French land lines, and enjoy all the necessary

                            Torbay, Nova Scotia. This cable was laid under the act of March 29, 1867
                            (15 Stat., 10), conferring upon the American Atlantic Cable Telegraph
                            Company the privilege for twenty years to land a submarine telegraph

                            no amalgamation should take place with any other company for the purpose

                            in his letter to Mr. Eckert of January 2, 1877, saying: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>On receiving such assurances from the promoters of the company,

                                <p>The President adheres to the views which he expressed to Congress
                                    in December, 1875, that no line should be allowed to land on the
                                    shores of the United States which is not, by prohibition in its
                                    charter or otherwise to the satisfaction of the Government,

                                <p>These views are understood to have met the approval of Congress
                                    and of the people of the United States, indicated by the tacit
                                    acquiescence of the Congress, and by the expressed approval of
                                    individual members of that body, and the general approval of the
                                    public press of the country. In the same message the President
                                    announced that the right to control the conditions for the
                                    laying of a cable within the jurisdictional waters of the United
                                    States, to connect our shores with those of any foreign state,
                                    pertains exclusively to the Government of the United States,
                                    under such limitations and conditions as Congress may impose,
                                    And he further stated that, unless Congress otherwise direct, he
                                    would feel it his duty to prevent the landing of any telegraphic
                                    cable which does not conform (among others) to the point above

                                <p>The President is of the opinion that the control of the United
                                    States over its jurisdictional waters extends to the right of
                                    discontinuing and preventing their use by a cable whose

                        <p>On October 18, 1889, the Compagnie Française du Télégraphe de Paris à
                            New-York applied to your Department for permission to lay a cable from
                            San Domingo to the United States. To this request Mr. Blaine replied,
                            December 21, 1889: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>While the authority of the President to grant the permission you

                                    ratification by Congress, yet there are certain conditions which
                                    he regards as absolutely essential before such provisional
                                    permission can be accorded.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>These conditions are as follows:</p>
                        <p>(1) That neither the company, its successors or assigns, nor any cable
                            with which it connects, shall receive from any foreign government
                            exclusive privileges which would prevent the establishment and operation
                            of a cable of an American company in the jurisdiction of such foreign
                            government.</p>
                        <p>(2) That the company shall not consolidate or amalgamate with any other
                            line or combine therewith for the purpose of regulating rates.</p>
                        <p>(3) That the charges to the Government of the United States shall not be
                            greater than those to any other government, and the general charges
                            shall be reasonable.</p>
                        <p>(4) That the Government of the United States shall be entitled to the
                            same or similar privileges as may by law, regulation, or agreement be
                            granted to any other government.</p>
                        <p>(5) That a citizen of the United States shall stand on the same footing
                            as regards privileges with citizens of San Domingo.</p>
                        <p>(6) That messages shall have precedence in the following order: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Government messages and official messages to
                            the Government; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) telegraphic business; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) general business.</p>
                        <p>(7) That the line shall be kept open for daily business, and all
                            messages, in the above order, be transmitted according to the time of
                            receipt.</p>
                        <p>Conditions similar to these were required of your company in 1879 in
                            reply to its application for authority to land one or more of its cables
                            on the Atlantic coast of this country, and assented to by the company’s
                            order November 5, 1879. And it would seem needless to add that similar
                            conditions have been imposed upon all cable companies desiring to land
                            their cables from foreign countries upon the shores of the United
                            States. It will be observed, however, that the first condition has been
                            modified to meet a case which did not arise in 1879, of the cable for
                            which the privilege of landing is sought being used as a link in a
                            longer line of communication. Such a case is believed now to exist in
                            respect to the proposed cable between the United States and San Domingo,
                            which is understood to be only a link in a line between the United
                            States and South America. The spirit and purpose of the first condition
                            imposed in 1879 require that American cable companies should not now be
                            excluded from operating and establishing lines between the United States
                            and” South America, either directly or by way of San Domingo.</p>
                        <p>The President, therefore, directs me to say that if the foregoing
                            conditions are satisfactory to your company, and it will first file in
                            this Department a duly authenticated copy of the concession granted by
                            the Dominican Government to land its cable at Puerto Plata, together
                            with a like certified copy of the conditions imposed by this Government,
                            he will be willing to grant the necessary permission to your company to
                            land its cable at Charleston, S. C, subject to the future action of
                            Congress. (House of Representatives, Fifty-second Congress, first
                            session, Report No. 964.)</p>
                        <p>The cable company took no steps to comply with these requirements. Nearly
                            two years later, on December 2, 1891, the French Cable Company, through
                            its attorney, Mr. Jefferson Chandler, renewed its application for
                            permission to land a cable. Meantime, on December 1, 1891, the company,
                            through the same attorney, obtained from the legislature of South
                            Carolina a joint resolution purporting to authorize it to land a cable
                            on the coast of that State, and in January, 1892, from the legislature
                            of Virginia an act purporting to authorize it to land a cable on the
                            shore of that State. On March 10, 1892, a joint resolution was
                            introduced into Congress to confirm these grants. This resolution was
                            referred to a committee, of which Mr. Wise was chairman, and to him was
                            addressed the letter of Acting Secretary Wharton of March 22, 1892,
                            published in House Report No. 961, Fifty-second Congress, first session.
                            After receiving this communication the committee reported a <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0205"/>substitute granting the landing
                            privilege upon the conditions prescribed by Mr. Blaine. Thereupon, for
                            the time being, the attempt of the company to obtain the consent of
                            Congress ceased.</p>
                        <p>On June 21, 1893, the same company, through the same attorney, applied
                            again to the Department of State ostensibly for permission to land a
                            cable on the shore of Virginia, but the application was accompanied by a
                            written argument to show that the President had no power to act in the
                            matter; the concluding paragraph of this argument and application being:

                                    application on its merits, and will declare that under the law
                                    the States may freely land cables, and that the Executive has no

                        <p>On the 24th of October, 1895, Mr. Scrymser laid before your Department
                            certain information concerning an agreement for laying and maintaining
                            submarine cables between France, North America, and the Antilles, to
                            which the Government of France was a party, and suggested that the
                            French minister be officially informed as to the policy of the
                            Government of the United States in the matter of cable-landing
                            privileges on our shores. Replying to this communication, on October 28,
                            1895, Mr. Olney referred to his former letter, and said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>There is no Federal statute conferring authority upon the

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>As a natural sequence of the attitude taken by your Department under Mr.
                            Gresham and Mr. Olney, La Compagnie Française des Cables Télégraphiques,
                            acting in connection with the United States and Haiti Telegraph and
                            Cable Company and the United States and Haiti Cable Company, in 1896
                            landed a cable, extending from Haiti to this country, at Coney Island,
                            New York, without permission of the Government. This Department, acting
                            through the Attorney-General and the United States attorney, brought an
                            injunction suit against the companies named to prevent the landing and
                            operation of the cable, but in view <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0206"/>of the fact that the cable had been landed, the motion
                            for an injunction against its operation was refused. At the same time
                            Judge Lacombe said (77 Fed. Rep., 496): <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>It is thought that the main proposition advanced by complainant’s
                                    counsel is a sound one, and that, without the consent of the
                                    General Government, no one, alien or native, has any right to
                                    establish a physical connection between the shores of this
                                    country and that of any foreign nation. Such consent may be
                                    implied as well as expressed, and whether it shall be granted or
                                    refused is a political question, and in the absence of
                                    Congressional action would seem to fall within the province of
                                    the Executive to decide. As was intimated upon the argument, it
                                    is further thought that the Executive may effectually enforce
                                    its decision without the aid of the courts.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It thus appears that from 1869 to August. 1893, during the terms of
                            Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur, Cleveland (first term), and Harrison, it
                            was held by the Presidents and their Secretaries of State that the
                            Executive has the power, in the absence of legislation by Congress, to
                            control the landing, and incidentally regulate the operation of foreign
                            submarine cables in the protection of the interests of this Government
                            and its citizens. Against this established rule, supported by the
                            opinion of the only United States judge who has passed upon the
                            question, stands opposed the refusal to act of Mr. Gresham, followed by
                            the dictum of Mr. Olney. The attitude taken by your Department under Mr.
                            Gresham has resulted in the landing of two foreign cables upon our
                            shores without permission of this Government and subject to no
                            limitations or restrictions whatever. Must this condition continue? Is
                            the President powerless to act until Congress legislates?</p>
                        <p>A foreign submarine cable which lands upon our shores in its location
                            enjoys rights upon our territory, and in its operation provides a means
                            of international communication, public and private, political and
                            commercial.</p>
                        <p>The jurisdiction of this nation within its own territory is necessarily
                            exclusive and absolute. It is susceptible of no limitation not imposed

                            136.) No one has a right to land a foreign cable upon our shores and
                            establish a physical connection between our territory and that of a
                            foreign State without the consent of the Government of the United

                            executive power; has made him the commander in chief of the Army and
                            Navy; has authorized him, by and with the consent of the Senate, to make
                            treaties, and to appoint ambassadors, public ministers, and consuls, and
                            has made it his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.
                            In the protection of these fundamental rights, which are based upon the
                            Constitution and grow out of the jurisdiction of this nation over its
                            own territory and its international rights and obligations as a distinct
                            sovereignty, the President is not limited to the enforcement of specific
                            acts of Congress. He takes a solemn oath to faithfully execute the
                            office of President, and to preserve, protect, and defend the
                            Constitution of the United States. To do this, he must preserve,
                            protect, and defend those fundamental rights which flow from the
                            Constitution itself and belong to the sovereignty it created. (Mr.

                        <p>The President has charge of our relations with foreign powers. It is his
                            duty to see that, in the exchange of comities among nations, we get as
                            much as we give. He ought not to stand by and permit a cable to land on
                            our shores under a concession from a foreign power which does not permit
                            our cables to land on its shores and enjoy there facilities equal to
                            those accorded its cable here. For this reason President Grant insisted
                            on the first point in his message of 1875.</p>
                        <p>The President is not only the head of the diplomatic service, but
                            commander in chief of the Army and Navy. A submarine cable is of
                            inestimable service to the Government in communicating with its officers
                            in the diplomatic and consular service, and in the Army and Navy when
                            abroad. The President should therefore demand that the Government have
                            precedence in the use of the line, and this was done by President Grant
                            in the third point of his message.</p>
                        <p>Treating a cable simply as an instrument of commerce, it is the duty of
                            the President, pending legislation by Congress, to impose such
                            restrictions as will forbid unjust discriminations, prevent monopolies,
                            promote competition, and secure reasonable rates. These were the objects
                            of the second and fourth points in President Grant’s message.</p>
                        <p>The executive permission to land a cable is, of course, subject to
                            subsequent Congressional action. The President’s authority to control
                            the landing of a foreign cable does not flow from his right to permit it
                            in the sense of granting a franchise, but from his power to prohibit it
                            should he deem it an encroachment on our rights or prejudicial to our
                            interests. The unconditional landing of a foreign cable might be both,
                            and therefore to be prohibited, but a landing under judicious
                            restrictions and conditions might be neither, and therefore to be
                            permitted, in the promotion of international intercourse.</p>
                        <p>I am of the opinion, therefore, that the President has the power, in the
                            absence of legislative enactment, to control the landing of foreign
                            submarine cables. He may either prevent the lauding, if the rights
                            intrusted to his care so demand, or permit it on conditions which will
                            protect the interests of this Government and its citizens; and if a
                            landing has been effected without the consent or against the protest of
                            this Government, respect for its rights and compliance with its terms
                            may be enforced by applying the prohibition to the operation of the
                            line, unless the necessary conditions are accepted and observed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am in receipt of your No. 212, of
                            December 20, stating that Mr. Andrew Roy, of Glen Roy, Ohio, who desires
                            to procure the admission of his son, Robert Roy, to the School of Mines,
                            informs the Department that this can only be done through this embassy,
                            and asking, in view of occasional inquiries of this nature, for
                            information on the subject, as well as on the eligibility of American
                            pupils to enter the French schools.</p>
                        <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0208"/>
                        <p>Mr. Boy’s statement is correct. No foreign student can be admitted to the
                            School of Mines unless it be on the formal application of the diplomatic
                            representative of his country. This rule is not confined to the School
                            of Mines only; it applies to every Government school, superior or
                            primary, without a single exception. No American can enter any of the
                            scientific, artistic, literary, or military schools of France—medicine,
                            pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary, painting, design, architecture, music,
                            declamation, engineering, etc.—if his admission is not asked for or
                            recommended by this embassy. In most of the cases two letters suffice;
                            one making the application, the other expressing thanks when the request
                            is granted. But in a great number of cases many more are necessary, for
                            the reason that those proposing to enter any of the schools of a high
                            grade have to produce certain certificates of studies or diplomas, which
                            the authorities will not take into consideration unless they come from
                            the embassy. These rules are applied to all foreign students. No
                            discrimination is made against Americans; on the contrary, the
                            experience of this embassy goes to show that the authorities extend to
                            them all possible facilities. American students are numerous in Paris,
                            and as a rule they are much liked by the managers and professors of
                            French institutions of learning.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the School of Mines, foreigners can be admitted there
                            either as foreign pupils, in which case they have to stand an
                            examination, or as free auditors, in which case there is no examination.
                            But all the courses are not open to that class of students, and they are
                            not entitled to a diploma. In both cases they have to pay a sum of 50
                            francs for matriculation.</p>
                        <p>If Mr. Boy will inform me of his intentions, I will take pleasure in
                            making the necessary application for the admission of his son. It is not
                            likely to be refused unless the school should be too full, as it
                            occasionally happens, in which case applications are put off to the
                            following year.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: The bill approved by
                            the House of Representatives, now before the Senate of the United
                            States, relating to the tariff of the United States (H. R. 379) provides
                            in Schedule E, No. 206, that sugars, etc., the product of any country
                            which pays, directly or indirectly, a bounty on the export thereof shall
                            pay, apart from the actual duty set forth in the said No. 206, an
                            additional duty equal to such export bounty so far as this bounty shall
                            be in excess of any (internal) tax collected upon such sugars or upon
                            the raw materials (beet or cane) used in their manufacture.</p>
                        <p>By instruction of the Imperial Government, I have the honor respectfully
                            to invite your excellency’s attention to the fact that this provision
                            can not be reconciled with the right of the most favored nation, which
                            is granted by existing treaty stipulations to German products with
                            respect to the duties to be imposed upon them on entry into the United
                            States. The above provision, should it become a law, would, on the
                            contrary, by imposing upon German sugar a special additional duty and
                            thereby establishing in the aggregate a higher duty than upon sugars
                            from various other countries, seriously damage, in treaty violation,
                            German exports to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency is aware that this question was already discussed in the
                            year 1894 between the Imperial Government and the Government of the
                            United States. I may, in especial, refer to the memorandum of this
                            embassy of July 16, 1894, and to the note of August 28, 1894, addressed
                            by my predecessor, Baron Saurma, to the Secretary of State, Mr. W. Q.
                            Gresham, both of which are found printed on <ref target="frus1894#pg_234">pages 234</ref> and <ref target="frus1894#pg_235">235 of the proper volume of Foreign
                                Relations of 1894</ref>.</p>
                        <p>It appears to me needless, therefore, to repeat here the text of these
                            two documents; but I must say here emphatically that I accept in their
                            entirety as my own the arguments advanced therein on the part of my
                            predecessor in behalf of the opinion held by the Imperial Government. I
                            must state furthermore here that the damage which threatens German
                            exports from the provisions of the present bill before Congress is a
                            much heavier one than that which resulted from the tariff law of August
                            28, 1894, as this law provided only for an additional duty of one-tenth
                            of a cent per pound on German sugar, while the present bill, if it
                            should become a law, will entail a much higher additional duty upon
                            German sugar.</p>
                        <p>As your excellency further knows, the Government of the United States has
                            unreservedly recognized the justice of our protest against any
                            additional duty based on our export bounty upon German sugar. This is
                            clearly expressed in words in the report by Secretary of State <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0210"/>W. Q. Gresham to the President
                            of the United States, of October 12, 1894, a copy of which was
                            communicated to this embassy in a note of December 7, 1894, and may be
                            found printed on <ref target="frus1894#pg_236">pages 236</ref> and <ref target="frus1894#pg_239">239 of the proper volume of Foreign
                                Relations for the year 1894</ref>. The President of the United
                            States explicitly concurred in this view of the Secretary of State by
                            recommending to Congress in his annual message of December, 1894, the
                            repeal of the additional duty upon German sugar. The Imperial Government
                            may, therefore, entertain the hope that the Government of the United
                            States will exert every endeavor to explain to Congress the importance
                            of the existing treaty obligations between Germany and the United
                            States, and the consequences to be adduced therefrom, in order to
                            prevent the proposed provision concerning the addition of the amount of
                            the German export bounty to the duty upon German sugar from becoming a
                            law in violation of treaty obligation.</p>
                        <p>On this occasion 1 may invite your excellency’s attention to another
                            point which my predecessor in 1894 only touched upon. On August 22,
                            1891, declarations were exchanged at Saratoga between Mr. von Mumm, the
                            Imperial chargé d’affaires ad interim, and Mr. John W. Foster, specially
                            empowered by the United States, which had on the one part the
                            importation of German sugar into the United States in view, and on the
                            other the importation of American pork into Germany. The United States
                            made as the basis of these declarations the admission, free of duty, of
                            German sugar, pursuant to the tariff act of October 1, 1890. The tariff
                            act of August 28, 1894, had already shifted in an unfavorable way for
                            Germany the premises upon which the exchange of these notes were
                            effected and they would be changed still more to the disadvantage of
                            Germany if the present bill, now before Congress, should without
                            amendment concerning sugar become a law. The Imperial Government would
                            in such event be compelled to regard the premises as defective upon
                            which the German declarations had been based in the correspondence
                            exchanged in August, 1891, arid it would, moreover, be confronted with
                            the question whether those advantages should be further continued which
                            it had hitherto extended to the United States by applying to the
                            importations from that country, especially with regard to its
                            agricultural products, the minimum tariff established by the customs
                            treaties concluded between the German Empire on the one hand and
                            Austria-Hungary and several other States on the other.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the advantages which the United States and especially its
                            agriculture has been afforded by these reduced duties, I may refer to
                            the note of Mr. von Mumm, chargé d’affaires ad interim, of December 10,
                            1891, in the annex to which the duty rates of the general German tariff
                            are contrasted with the treaty tariff. This note will be found printed
                            as an annex to the proclamation of the President of the United States of
                            February 1, 1892.</p>

                            Dingley bill, the receipt of which your excellency had the kindness to

                            7th ultimo, No. 206, Schedule E, was referred to by me as the one
                            against whose provisions I had been instructed by the Imperial
                            Government to protest on the ground of the treaties concluded by the
                            United States with various German States. The Committee on Finance of
                            the United States Senate has, meantime, made important changes in the
                            original wording of the tariff bill, has eliminated from Schedule E the
                            discriminating duty on sugar from countries which pay export bounties,
                            and has introduced that discriminating duty, in a form which extends to
                            goods of all kinds, into the new section 3.</p>
                        <p>I consequently have the honor, with a view to the prevention of
                            misunderstandings, most respectfully to inform your excellency that the

                            naturally has reference to the contents of the new section 3, since in
                            case the contents of the new section 3 should acquire the force of law,
                            German goods would be obliged to pay a discriminating duty in addition
                            to the ordinary duties.</p>
                        <p>I should be obliged to your excellency if you would have the kindness to

                            tariff act, which took effect on the 24th instant, provides, in section
                            5, that any dutiable article imported into the United States from a
                            foreign country, on which an export bounty is paid by the foreign State,
                            shall be subject, in addition to the general duty imposed by the tariff
                            act, to an additional duty equal to the net amount of the export
                            bounty.</p>
                        <p>A higher duty is imposed on German sugar by the above provision than upon
                            sugar from several other countries.</p>
                        <p>Against this discriminating treatment of German sugar, which, in the
                            opinion of the Imperial Government, is incompatible both with the most
                            favored nation rights that are secured to German productions by the
                            treaties in force as regards the duties to be levied on them when they
                            are imported into the United States, and with the provisions of the
                            Saratoga agreement of August 22, 1891, the German ambassador, in
                            pursuance of instructions received, protested in his notes of April 5
                            and May 16, 1897, in case the treaty-violating provision should acquire
                            the force of law.</p>
                        <p>Since that is now the case, in consequence of the passage of the entire
                            tariff act on the 24th instant, I have been instructed by the Imperial
                            Government, and accordingly have the honor, for the reasons which were
                            stated in Baron Thielmann’s aforesaid two notes, and which are therefore
                            not repeated here, to hereby again protest against the treaty-violating
                            treatment of German sugar in the United States tariff act of July 24,
                            1897.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: By the Department’s note, No. 359, of July
                            30 last, you were informed that yours of the 28th of the same month,
                            relative to the application of section 5 of the United States tariff act
                            of July 24, 1897, to bounty sugar imported from Germany, had been
                            referred to the Secretary of the Treasury for his consideration. That
                            official having given careful attention to the protest which your said
                            note contains, I have the honor to acquaint you with the substance of
                            his conclusions as follows:</p>
                        <p>The protest of your Government rests upon two grounds: (1) That “this
                            discriminating treatment of German sugar is incompatible with the most
                            favored nation rights that are secured to German productions by the
                            treaties in force as regards the duties to be levied on them when they
                            are imported into the United States,” and (2) “that it is incompatible
                            with the provisions of the Saratoga agreement of August 22, 1891.”</p>
                        <p>An answer to the first of these objections may be found in the opinion of
                            November 13, 1894, of the Attorney-General upon the question whether
                            salt exported from Germany was dutiable under paragraph 608 of the
                            tariff act of August 28, 1894, in view of the fact that Germany imposed
                            duties upon salt exported from the United States. In this opinion the
                            Attorney-General said, in part: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>If it be assumed * * * that the treaty of 1828 binds the United
                                    States as regards all the constituent parts of the German
                                    Empire, the claim of the German ambassador, founded upon the
                                    most favored nation clause, must be pronounced untenable for at
                                    least two conclusive reasons. In the first place, the most
                                    favored nation clause of our treaties with foreign powers has,
                                    from the foundation of our Government, been invariably construed
                                    both as not forbidding any internal regulations necessary for
                                    the protection of our home industries and as permitting
                                    commercial concessions to a country which are not gratuitous,
                                    but are in return for equivalent concessions, and to which no
                                    other country is entitled except upon rendering the same
                                    equivalents. Thus, Mr. Jefferson, when Secretary of State in
                                    1792, said of treaties exchanging the rights of the most favored
                                    nation that they leave each party free to make what in ternal
                                    regulations they please and to give what preference they find
                                    expedient to native merchants, vessels, and productions. In 1817
                                    Mr. John Quincy Adams, acting in the same official capacity,
                                    took the ground that the most favored nation clause only covered
                                    gratuitous favors and did not touch concessions for equivalents,
                                    express or implied. Mr. Clay, Mr. Livingston, Mr. Evarts, and
                                    Mr. Bayard, when at the head of the Department of State, have
                                    each given official expression to the same view. It has also
                                    received the sanction of the Supreme Court in more than one
                                    well-considered decision. * * * In the next place, even if the
                                    provisions of our recent tariff act under consideration could be
                                    deemed to contravene the most favored nation clause of the
                                    treaty with Germany (as they cannot be for the reasons stated),
                                    the result would be the same. The tariff act is a statute later
                                    than the treaty, and, so far as inconsistent with it, is
                                    controlling.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as the subject-matter of the above opinion and the question
                            under consideration are, with respect to the most favored nation clause,
                            in pari materia, the reasoning of the former may, under the well-known
                            rule of construction, be applied to the latter question. But reliance
                            upon this principle is not necessary to make the opinion of the
                            Attorney-General applicable to the present case. One paragraph thereof
                            is directly in point.</p>

                                powers—certainly by Germany and Great Britain. Thus as the clause
                                permits any internal regulations that a country may find necessary

                                might be counteracted by the import sugar duty of another without
                                causing any discrimination which could be deemed a violation of the

                        <p>As to the second ground of protest—that of incompatibility with the
                            Saratoga agreement of August 22, 1891, the Secretary of the Treasury is
                            of the opinion, in which I join, that the said agreement was no longer
                            in force at the time of the passage of the act of July 24, 1897,
                            inasmuch as the act of August 28, 1894, repealed section 3 of the act of
                            October 1, 1890, under which the agreement was made.</p>
                        <p>It is to be added that the protest of Baron von Thielmann against the
                            enforcement of the corresponding paragraph of the act of August 28,
                            1894, and against the enactment of section 5 of the act of July 24,
                            1897, having been at his request laid by me before the Senate on May 19
                            last, the Congress of the United States acted with full knowledge of
                            them.</p>

                            <p>The undersigned, chargé d’affaires of the United States of America,
                                has the honor to inform His Excellency Ambassador von Bulow, acting
                                secretary of state for foreign affairs, that he has just been
                                furnished with authentic reports from the American consular officers
                                in Germany, which show that the total value of the exports from
                                Germany to the United States for the quarter ending September 30,
                                1897, was $14,839,459.73, as compared with $26,233,467.41 for the
                                same quarter of 1896. An analysis of this decrease (which amounts to
                                $11,394,007.68), shows that more than one-half of its amount (or
                                $6,591,917), is in the article “sugar” alone. From the consular
                                districts of Bremerhaven, Brunswick, Hamburg, Magdeburg, Stettin,
                                and Breslau the value of <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0214"/>the sugar exported to the United States in the third quarter of
                                1896 was $6,662,951, while in the quarter just ended the amount was
                                $78,034.</p>
                            <p>In this connection, however, the undersigned begs to call attention
                                to the fact that the increase in the value of the total exports from
                                Germany to the United States for the fiscal year ending June 30,
                                1897, over their value in the preceding year was $21,219,779.81, the
                                whole amount of which is due to increased exports from the six
                                districts above mentioned, the increase and decrease from the other
                                districts in Germany approximately being equivalent to each
                                other.</p>
                            <p>In view of this enormous volume of imports into the United States,
                                just before and in anticipation of a change in the American tariff,
                                and of the consequent overstocking of the American market—which was
                                especially the case with sugar—it was, of course, to be anticipated
                                that, for the next quarter at least, the returns would be kept below
                                those of similar periods immediately before the enactment of the
                                existing American tariff. It would therefore appear to be nothing
                                more than reasonable that if the decrease during the past quarter is
                                to be attributed to the new tariff, the increase during the last
                                fiscal year above referred to should be considered at the same time,
                                and that no conclusions should be drawn (as has been done in the
                                German press), in regard to its possible or probable effect upon
                                trade between the two countries concerned until abnormal conditions
                                have disappeared and the value of the goods exported from Germany to
                                the United States is again determined by the actual demand for such
                                goods, and not by the fictitious state of the markets.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: Josef Georg Surmann,
                            who resides in Alsace-Lorraine, claimed, in February last, when an
                            official investigation was held with a view to settling the question of
                            his citizenship, to be a citizen of the United States, and produced, in
                            support of his claim, the inclosed certificate of the United States
                            consul at Freiburg in Breisgan.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First, however, Karl Surmann, the father, was, at the time of the
                                birth of his son, Josef Georg, i.e., on the 1st of July, 1873, a
                                subject of the German Empire; for he is a native of Sennheim, where
                                he was born July 3, 1850, and did not elect, during the time which
                                was allowed for that purpose, to become a French citizen. He was,
                                moreover, according to his own declaration, made before the Imperial
                                authorities, a resident of Alsace-Lorraine at the time of the
                                cession of that country to the German Empire in pursuance of the
                                Frankfort treaty of peace of May 10, 1871.</item>
                            <item>Second, he left the territory of the United States in the year
                                1874 with his son Josef Georg, before the latter had reached his
                                second year. Josef Georg Surmann has never returned to the United
                                States, and, so far as can be ascertained, has never, since
                                attaining his majority, declared his option to become an American
                                citizen.</item>
                        </list>
                        <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0215"/>
                        <p>It appears doubtful, under the circumstances, in view of the practice
                            prevailing in the United States, whether Josef Georg Surmann should
                            really be considered a citizen of the United States on account of his
                            birth in this country. In the coincidently similar case of Speck, the I
                            Swiss, for instance, it was denied by the United States Government that
                            Speck was a citizen of the United States. (See Acting Secretary Seward’s
                            note of August 20, 1878, in Wharton’s Digest of the International Law of
                            the United States, Washington, 1886, Vol. II, §183, p. 396.) Compare
                            also the note of Secretary Evarts, of December 31, 1878, loc. cit.</p>
                        <p>Josef Georg Surmann can assert his claim to American citizenship on no
                            ground save that of his birth in the United States.</p>
                        <p>His father does, indeed, claim that he acquired American citizenship,
                            through naturalization, for himself and also for his son (who was then a
                            minor) during his stay in the United States. He has, however, failed to
                            furnish any proof of this claim. The certificate produced by him,
                            bearing date of September 14, 1874, which is herewith inclosed, merely
                            shows that he made, on that day, before the judge in Cleveland, the
                            sworn declaration of his intention to become an American citizen which
                            must be made at least two years before naturalization, according to
                            Title XXX, section 2165, subsection 1, of the Revised Statutes of the
                            United States, edition of 1878.</p>
                        <p>There is, however, absolutely no proof that Karl Surmann was afterwards
                            naturalized, and the contrary seems to be shown by the fact that he
                            finally left the United States in the latter part of the year 1874,
                            after a residence of little more loan three years, thus failing to meet
                            the requirement of section 2170 of the Revised Statutes, which reads
                            thus: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>No alien shall be admitted to become a citizen who has not, for
                                    the continued term of five years next preceding his admission,
                                    resided within the United States.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I have the honor most respectfully to remark, in this connection, that
                            the statement made in the certificate of September 14, 1874, viz, that
                            Karl Surmann arrived in the United States in July, 1870, is, according
                            to his own subsequent declarations, erroneous, and that he did not leave
                            Sennheim, his birthplace, until May, 1871.</p>
                        <p>I will further add, for the sake of completeness, that Karl Surmann, the
                            father, took up his abode at Muhlhausen, Alsatia, after his return from
                            the United States with his family; that he removed thence in February,
                            1876, to Fontaines-les Luxenil, in France, and remained there until
                            October, 1888, that is to say, he resided there uninterruptedly for more
                            than ten years, which involved the loss of German citizenship for

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of the 11th instant, presenting certain inquiries
                            respecting the citizenship of one Josef Georg Surmann.</p>
                        <p>From the statement contained in your note and the papers accompanying the
                            same, it appears that Josef Georg Surmann was born at Cleveland, Ohio,
                            July 1, 1873; that his father, Karl Surmann, came to the United States
                            in July, 1870, or, according to later statements, in May, 1871; that he
                            declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States before
                            the probate court of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, September 14, 1874, but that
                            the latter part of the same year he quitted the United States, taking
                            his infant son with him. It would seem that the father, Karl, never
                            returned to the United States to perfect his acquisition of American
                            citizenship, but that, after a residence of twelve years in France,
                            whereby he forfeited for himself, his wife, and minor children his
                            German citizenship, he has returned to his native place, Sennheim, in
                            Alsace-Lorraine, where he has resided since 1888.</p>
                        <p>The son, Josef Georg Surmann, of whom you inquire, has never returned to
                            the United States, and is now over 23 years old.</p>
                        <p>The certificate signed by the United States commercial agent at Freiburg
                            in Baden, which you submit to me, contains the only statements <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0217"/>material to the young man’s
                            case of which the Department has any knowledge. Upon those statements
                            Josef Georg Surmann is, according to the Constitution and laws of the
                            United States, a citizen there off by birth. Conformably to a general
                            rule of international law, followed by this Department in its special
                            rulings in cases as they arise, the young man might, if sojourning in a
                            foreign country, have been required, on attaining the age of 21, to make
                            formal option of allegiance. It does not appear whether he ever made
                            such option or was afforded an opportunity to do so. Were he now called
                            upon to elect American allegiance, and were he to demonstrate his
                            immediate purpose of returning to the United States, here to dwell and
                            discharge the duties of citizenship, a passport might be issued to him
                            by the United States ambassador at Berlin upon being satisfied of the
                            bona fides of the case. Otherwise, following the precedents established
                            for many years, to which you advert, this Department would be
                            constrained to regard Josef Georg Surmann as having voluntarily
                            relinquished his right to continued protection as a citizen of the
                            United States by reason of and during his prolonged and indefinite
                            sojourn abroad after attaining majority. The executive branch of this
                            Government is not competent to declare that any person lawfully born or
                            becoming a citizen of the United States may have forfeited his
                            citizenship for any cause, inasmuch as the laws of the United States
                            make no provision for executive determination of such a case. Were the
                            young man within the jurisdiction of the United States, and were a
                            judicial issue raised involving the question of his citizenship, that
                            would be a matter of fact and of law for the decision of the competent
                            court, either State or Federal, as the case might be.</p>
                        <p>A copy of your note and of the present reply will be sent to the United
                            States ambassador at Berlin for his information and guidance should
                            Josef Georg Surmann apply to him for a passport under the circumstances
                            above stated.</p>
                        <p>The original inclosures which accompanied your note are herewith returned
                            as requested.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With your No. 107, of September 25 last,
                            you inclosed a compilation furnished by the foreign office of cases of
                            trichinae found by German inspectors in American pork during the first
                            half of the year 1897.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of Agriculture, to whom I communicated the same, desires me
                            to express to you his appreciation of your report, and to assure you
                            that every effort will be made to trace the origin of the meat by his
                            Department, which will take any additional steps that may be necessary
                            to prevent such occurrences in the future. However, this Government does
                            not hold that it can give an absolute guaranty that inspected pork is
                            free from trichinae. The microscopic character of the parasite, together
                            with its possible distribution to all parts of the carcass, makes it a
                            very difficult if not impossible matter to discover infection in all
                            cases in which it exists. As the German Government required the
                            microscopic inspection of the pork consumed by its population, this
                            Government has endeavored to meet that requirement by making a
                            microscopic inspection of the pork shipped from this country to Germany.
                            It can not, however, undertake to do by this inspection what the Germans
                            themselves have proved to be impossible by the results of the very
                            perfect and painstaking inspection maintained in that country. The
                            occasional discovery by German inspectors of trichinae in a piece of
                            American pork is neither an evidence of careless inspection in this
                            country nor an indication that our inspected pork is more dangerous than
                            the German inspected pork.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of Agriculture has made a very careful search through the
                            medical literature of Germany in order to determine to what extent the
                            microscopic inspection of that country protects the people against
                            trichinosis. There have been found recorded in German literature 4,596
                            cases of trichinosis in Germany, and 262 deaths occurring during the
                            fifteen years from 1881 to 1895; and of these, 1,815 cases and 115
                            deaths resulted from German inspected pork. Nor can it be said that
                            these cases largely occurred during the early years of the inspection
                            service before methods had been perfected, for it is found that they
                            occur throughout the entire period. And even during the years 1896 and
                            1897 there are recorded in Prussia alone 160 cases and 8 deaths from
                            trichinosis, of which 102 cases and 2 deaths resulted from inspected
                            German pork; and in all of Germany there were during the two years last
                            mentioned 174 cases and 8 deaths from trichinosis, of which 103 cases
                            and 2 deaths were due to inspected German pork. It is plain, therefore,
                            that a large proportion of the cases of trichinosis which occur in
                            Germany are the result of eating pork which German inspectors have
                            declared to be free from trichinae, but which evidently contained that
                            parasite, as otherwise the disease would not have developed.</p>
                        <p>This Government has undertaken in good faith the microscopic inspection
                            of pork exported to Germany, and endeavors to conduct this in as perfect
                            a manner as circumstances permit; but the pork from this country should
                            not be treated in a markedly unfriendly manner and held to be more
                            dangerous than the pork of other countries or that produced in Germany,
                            when the records show that in the fifteen years from 1881 to 1895,
                            inclusive, there were 1,140 cases of trichinosis in Prussia caused by
                            inspected pork, being 49 per cent of all the cases occurring in that
                            country during that period and that there were 96 <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0225"/>deaths from this disease during that
                            period, caused by inspected pork, being 60.3 per cent of all the deaths
                            from trichinosis in that country. The harmlessness of the American pork
                            sold in Germany is shown by the fact that, during the past seventeen
                            years, notwithstanding the outcry against and the suspicion of such
                            pork, the evidence shows that but an extremely small number of
                            trichinosis in man and not a single death can be reasonably attributed
                            to it. This search of the German medical literature demonstrates that so
                            far as the danger from trichinosis is concerned, American pork is not to
                            be compared with the inspected German pork.</p>
                        <p>You will bring the foregoing to the attention of the minister for foreign

                                    inspection. The numerous cases of trichinosis in man which have
                                    occurred in Germany from eating pork inspected there shows the
                                    impossibility of discovering all trichinous meat by the first

                                    it is unjust to our shippers to require them to pay the expense
                                    of a second inspection after it arrives in Germany. This
                                    expense, together with the damage from unpacking, exposure, and
                                    hastily repacking, is a great obstacle to this important branch
                                    of our commerce with the German nation.</item>

                            translations of two reports from the foreign office on the subject of
                            trichinous American pork found in Germany during the first half of the
                            year 1897. One of these reports is a detailed statement of matters
                            regarding trichinous American pork imported into Stettin from January 1
                            to June 30, 1897, while the other report is a summarized statement of
                            matters regarding trichinous American pork imported into Prussia for the
                            same period. In comparing these two reports one finds that in the
                            detailed statement for <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0226"/>Stettin
                            54 cases of American trichinous pork are stated to have been imported
                            into that place from the United States during the first half of the
                            present year, while in the summarized statement for Prussia the number
                            therein stated to have been imported into Stettin is 108. The foreign
                            office has explained this inconsistency by saying that in the detailed
                            report only those cases were included in which full, definite
                            information was obtainable, while in the summarized report many cases
                            were included where definite information was not possible owing to
                            indistinct labels or for some other unknown reasons. When it was
                            suggested to one of the chief officials at the foreign office that
                            possibly some of these 108 cases of trichinae might have been found in
                            pork not of American origin, the answer was that there was positively no
                            doubt as to the origin of the meat in the reports transmitted to the
                            embassy, as all cases of doubtful origin had been excluded before
                            transmittal.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit herewith the
                            correspondence had with the Imperial German foreign office, in the
                            matter of the impressment into the German army of Alfred Meyer.</p>
                        <p>The intervention on behalf of Meyer was made on the 31st of December
                            last, the day following the receipt of a communication from the United
                            States consulate at Hamburg, informing the embassy that he had been
                            impressed into the German army, and in the absence of any reply to my
                            first note, I again brought the subject to the attention of Baron von
                            Marschall, in notes of February 1,11, and 20, and of March 5, and, in
                            addition to these written communications, I called in person at the
                            foreign office on or about the 26th ultimo, and urged upon his
                            excellency the importance of an early reply to the representations
                            before made in writing.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that Meyer was born in Baltimore on December 16,
                            1875, that he is unable to furnish any evidence that his father, who was
                            born in Prussia, ever became an American citizen; and that his father
                            returned to Germany in 1879, taking his son with him, where he
                            afterwards resided until the time of his death.</p>
                        <p>The conclusion of the German Government is that the fact that Meyer was
                            born abroad does not alter his legal status, and that according to
                            German law he possesses the nationality which he inherited from his
                            father; that is to say, that he is a Prussian subject, and that if
                            through the fact of his birth at Baltimore he acquired American
                            citizenship according to American law, he possesses a double
                            nationality, and consequently is bound to perform the obligations to
                            both countries, as well to Germany as to the United States, which are
                            put upon him by the laws of both these countries, and that the Prussian
                            Government does not find itself in a position to comply with the request
                            that he be discharged.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor, etc.,</p>

                            <p>The undersigned, ambassador, etc., of the United States of America,
                                has the honor to invite the attention of His Excellency Baron
                                Marsehall von Bieberstein, Imperial secretary of state for foreign
                                affairs, to the case of one Alfred Meyer, a native citizen of the
                                United States, lately impressed into the Prussian military
                                service.</p>
                            <p>The facts of the case as presented to the embassy are as follows:</p>
                            <p>Alfred Meyer was born at Baltimore, Md., December 16, 1875, as is
                                shown by the certificate of birth herewith inclosed, with the
                                request for its ultimate return. His father, Moritz Meyer, a
                                naturalized American citizen, was borne at Pinne, near Posen, in
                                1839, emigrated to the United States, but returned to Germany
                                (Colmar, Al.) in 1880, bringing with him his son Alfred. His father
                                died in 1889 and his mother in 1894, at Burg, near Madgeburg. He was
                                impressed into the Prussian military service on October 1 last,
                                although he protested against it, claiming that he was a citizen of
                                the United States, and is now serving in the First Company
                                Eighty-fifth Regiment of Infantry (Duke of Holstein’s), at
                                Reudsburg. The undersigned has the honor to request that his
                                excellency will kindly cause an immediate investigation of this
                                case, and should the facts be found to be substantially as stated
                                that Meyer will be at once discharged from military service.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned avails himself, etc.,</p>

                            <p>The undersigned has the honor to inform his excellency, the
                                ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the United States of
                                America, Mr. Edwin F. Uhl, in regard to the impressment of Alfred
                                Meyer into the German army, which was last referred to in the note
                                verbale of the 24th ultimo, and while returning Meyer’s birth
                                certificate, as follows:</p>
                            <p>The intervention which was made in behalf of Meyer, in the note of
                                December 31, 1896—(F. O. 145)—is based upon the presumption that his
                                father, Moritz Meyer, who was born at Pinne, near Posen, and died in
                                Colmar, had acquired American citizenship through naturalization
                                during his sojourn in the United States. As yet this presumption has
                                not been proved to be correct. Neither the son, Alfred Meyer, nor
                                his uncle and former guardian, Hermann Meyer, a merchant at present
                                living at Colmar, has any knowledge of the naturalization of Moritz
                                Meyer. According to their statements, he emigrated from Germany in
                                1872, and went to Baltimore, where a son was born to him. In 1879 he
                                left the United States of America, taking his son with him, and
                                returned to Germany, and from that time until the time of his death
                                he lived in Colmar. He, therefore, retained his Prussian
                                nationality, which he had in the beginning, until the time of his
                                death, without having, as far as can be ascertained, acquired any
                                other nationality.</p>
                            <p>As Alfred Meyer has also lived in Germany since 1879, and was only
                                temporarily in Switzerland in 1895, the conclusion must be drawn <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0230"/>that, according to German
                                law, he possesses the nationality which he inherited from his
                                father; that is to say, that he is a Prussian subject. The fact that
                                he was born abroad does not alter the case. If through the fact of
                                his birth in Baltimore he acquired American citizenship according to
                                American law, he possesses a double nationality, and consequently is
                                bound to perform the obligations to both countries, as well to
                                Germany as to the United States of America, which are put upon him
                                by the laws of both of these countries.</p>
                            <p>As was stated in the note of the 15th of January, 1886, in the case
                                of Henry Rabien, which, if not exactly the same, is still similar
                                under existing circumstances, the treaty of February 22, 1868, on
                                the subject of nationality, has no application to the case of Alfred
                                Meyer, as in this case it has not been proved that the father,
                                Moritz Meyer, had become a naturalized citizen of the United States
                                of America at the time of the birth of his son.</p>
                            <p>It was, therefore, right that Alfred Meyer should be called upon to
                                serve in the German army, and the Prussian Government does not find
                                itself in a position to comply with the request that he be
                                discharged.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned, while promising a further communication in regard to
                                the case of Casimir Hartmann, which was also referred to in the note
                                verbale of the 24th ultimo, as the investigation in regard to his
                                impressment into the Second Hessian Infantry Regiment, No. 82, is
                                not yet completed, avails himself, etc.,</p>

                            <p>Referring to the esteemed note from the imperial foreign office of
                                the 14th instant, the undersigned, ambassador, etc., of the United
                                States of America, in order that there may be no misconception of
                                the position taken by him in regard to the case of Alfred Meyer, has
                                the honor to inform His Excellency Baron Marschall von Bieberstein,
                                Imperial secretary of state for foreign affairs, that his
                                intervention in Meyer’s behalf was not based upon the presumption
                                that his father, Moritz Meyer, had become a naturalized American
                                citizen, although it was understood that such was the case, but that
                                it was based upon the fact that, through his birth in Baltimore,
                                Alfred Meyer became according to American law a native citizen of
                                the United States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your No. 301, of the 19th ultimo, has been
                            received. You therewith transmit correspondence had with the Imperial
                            foreign office in the matter of the impressment into the German army of
                            Alfred Meyer.</p>
                        <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0231"/>
                        <p>Meyer was born in Baltimore in 1875, his father being a native Prussian.
                            In 1879 the father returned to Germany, taking his son with him, and
                            resided there until his death. There is no evidence that the father ever
                            became a citizen of the United States. The conclusion of the German
                            Government is that the fact of Meyer’s foreign birth does not alter his
                            legal status under German law, according to which he inherits his
                            father’s Prussian nationality, and that if through the fact of his birth
                            at Baltimore he acquired American citizenship, according to American
                            law, he possesses a double nationality, and consequently is bound to
                            perform the obligations of both countries, as well to Germany as to the
                            United States, which are put upon him by the laws of both those
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>In support of this conclusion Baron Marsehall refers to the case of Henry
                            Rabien, which arose in 1886, as “similar.” There is a very important
                            difference between the two cases. Rabien had made a formal declaration
                            before a German tribunal that he did not intend ever to settle in
                            America.</p>
                        <p>This fact alone was sufficient to justify this Government in dropping the
                            case. The course pursued by this Government in the Rabien case can not
                            by any means be considered as an admission of the right of the German
                            Government to impress native-born American citizens into its military
                            service. Questions in relation to the impressment of American citizens
                            in Germany usually arise in cases of sons born in the United States of
                            naturalized Americans of German origin, who return to Germany with their
                            sons during their minority. In some such cases the German Government
                            contended that the fathers by continued residence in Germany have
                            renounced their naturalization in the United States; but even then it
                            has repeatedly recognized the American citizenship of the sons and has
                            not attempted to compel them to perform military service.</p>
                        <p>The case of Ferdinand Revermann, which arose in 1885, is a case in point,
                            and, while the father had been duly naturalized in this country, the
                            status of the son was considered, in view of his birth in the United
                            States, independently of the father’s naturalization. The father
                            emigrated to the United States from Germany in 1850, was naturalized in
                            Illinois in 1856, and resided continuously in this country until 1871.
                            The son was born in Illinois in 1860, was taken to Germany by the father
                            in 1871, and continued to reside there until 1880, In the latter year
                            the Landrath at Munster certified that as he was born a citizen of the
                            United States his name would be stricken from the military rolls, and
                            this was done. He was, however, in October, 1884, summoned before the
                            Landrath and told that by order of the Royal Government at Munster he
                            must either become naturalized in Germany or leave the country. A week
                            later, his expulsion being ordered, he applied to the United States
                            legation to intervene for a suspension of the order and its reversal.
                            Minister Kasson represented the facts to the German foreign office in
                            his note of October 31, 1884. In replying to this note, on December 31,
                            Dr. Busch, the German foreign minister, contended that under the
                            treaties of 1868 regulating nationality the fathers in such cases should
                            be regarded as having renounced their naturalization by a longer sojourn
                            in Germany than two years, and said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The provisions of these treaties do not, however, extend to the
                                    minor children of persons naturalized in America. The rules
                                    there prescribed can not, therefore, find any application to the
                                    legal status of these children. Their legal status should,
                                    therefore, be judged rather by the principles of law governing
                                    in the United States, in view of the fact that the children have
                                    been born in America, and have thereby, apart from the
                                    naturalization of the fathers, independently acquired American
                                    citizenship. <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0232"/>American
                                    law, so far as known here, contains no provision which makes the
                                    renunciation of American naturalization by the father act upon
                                    his minor sons also. The Government of H. M. the Emperor has,
                                    therefore, no hesitation in recognizing such persons as American
                                    citizens. * * * Individuals possessing this character can not be
                                    made to perform military service in Germany.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Dr. Busch contended that, when the actual circumstances indicated that
                            the persons in question used their American citizenship for the purpose
                            of withdrawing themselves from the duties, and in particular from the
                            military duty devolving upon the domestic population, without being
                            disposed to abandon their permanent sojourn in Germany and the
                            advantages connected therewith, international principles permitted the
                            refusal to such persons of sojourn in Germany, and the adoption of
                            measures against them. The United German Government, he said, purposed
                            to act in the future with respect to all such cases in accordance with
                            the principles thus presented.</p>
                        <p>This Government, in replying to the above note, contested the right of
                            Germany to expel such persons upon abrupt notice at the pleasure of the
                            authorities. Mr. Frelinghuysen, in instructing Mr. Kasson, February 7,
                            1885, said that the decision of the German Government that the sons were
                            not within the provisions of the naturalization treaty of 1868 was just.
                            “But,” added he, “as American citizens by native right, they must come
                            under the general provisions of the treaty affecting all American
                            citizens who have not been naturalized.”</p>
                        <p>Other cases might be cited in which this Government has contended for and
                            the German Government has conceded the principle involved in the present
                            case; but the above will suffice. You will again bring the case to the
                            attention of the German foreign office, in view of the above, and urge
                            that Meyer be released from the army.</p>

                            <p>In the opinion of the Secretary of State of the United States there
                                is a very important difference between the Meyer case and the case
                                of Henry Rabien, referred to by his excellency in his note of March
                                14 last. Rabien had made a formal declaration before a German
                                tribunal that he did not intend ever to settle in America, and this
                                fact alone was sufficient to justify the United States Government in
                                dropping the case, and the course then pursued can not be, by any
                                means, considered as an admission of the right of the German
                                Government to impress native-born American citizens into its
                                military service. Questions in relation to the impressment of
                                American citizens in Germany usually arise in cases of sons born in
                                the United States of naturalized Americans of German origin who
                                return to Germany with their sons during their minority. In some
                                cases the German Government has contended that the fathers, by
                                continued residence in Germany, have renounced their naturalization
                                in the United States; but even then it has repeatedly recognized the
                                American citizenship of the sons and has not attempted to compel
                                them to perform military service.</p>
                            <p>The case of Ferdinand Revermann, which arose in 1885, is a case in
                                point, and while the father had been duly naturalized in the United
                                States, the status of the son was considered, in view of his birth
                                in the United States independently of the father’s naturalization.
                                The father emigrated to America from Germany in 1850; was
                                naturalized in Illinois in 1856, and resided continuously in the
                                United States until 1871. The son was born in Illinois in 1860, was
                                taken by the father to Germany in 1871, and continued to reside
                                there until 1880. In the latter year the Landrath at Munster
                                certified that as he was born a citizen of the United States, his
                                name would be stricken from the military rolls, and this was done.
                                He was, however, in October, 1884, summoned before the Landrath and
                                told that by order of the Royal Government at Munster he must either
                                become naturalized in Germany or leave the country. A week later he
                                applied to the United States legation for protection, and on October
                                31, 1884, Minister Kasson made intervention in his behalf.</p>
                            <p>In replying to this note on December 31, Dr. Busch, the German
                                foreign minister, contended that under the treaties of 1868,
                                regulating nationality, the fathers in such cases should be regarded
                                as having renounced their naturalization by a sojourn in Germany
                                longer than two years. He further said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>The provisions of these treaties do not, however, extend to
                                        the minor children of persons naturalized in America. The
                                        rules there prescribed can not, therefore, find any
                                        application to the legal status of these children. Their
                                        legal status should, therefore, be judged rather by the
                                        principles of law governing in the United States, in view of
                                        the fact that the children have been born in America, and
                                        have thereby, apart from the naturalization of the fathers,
                                        independently acquired American citizenship. American law,
                                        so far as known here, contains no provision which makes the
                                        renunciation of American naturalization by the father act
                                        upon his minor children. The Government of H. M. the Emperor
                                        has, therefore, no hesitation in recognizing such persons as
                                        American citizens.* * * Individuals possessing this
                                        character can not be made to perform military service in
                                        Germany.</p>

                            <p>Alfred Meyer was born in the United States in 1875, and, although
                                there is no evidence that his father ever became a citizen of the
                                United States, he acquired American citizenship independently”

                            I have the honor to inform you that the embassy is in receipt of a note
                            from the Imperial foreign office, dated July 23, 1897, a copy of which,
                            with translation, is herewith inclosed. From this note it appears that
                            the German Government confirms its former opinion—that Meyer, being born
                            in the United States of German parents, the proof of whose
                            naturalization in America was not forthcoming, was to be regarded as a
                            German subject and therefore could be held for military duty. Although
                            the principle <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0235"/>is not
                            relinquished, the aim in this particular case has been accomplished by
                            the discharge of Meyer as “unfit for service,” and as the Department
                            suggests (No. 38, July 6, 1897) that it may not be useful to push the
                            discussion further in this instance,” no further communication in the

                            <p>Referring to the notes of April 30 and June 30, 1897, the undersigned
                                has the honor to inform his excellency the ambassador extraordinary
                                and plenipotentiary of the United States of America, Mr. Andrew D.
                                White, that the request to release Alfred Meyer from service in the
                                German army has again been thoroughly investigated. If the request
                                in the note of April 30 last was based on the statements made in the
                                case of Ferdinand Revermann in a note to the foreign office dated
                                December 31, 1884, it must be stated that this case in a legal sense
                                was different from that of Alfred Meyer. With Revermann it was the
                                case of an American citizen who was born after his father was
                                naturalized in America, and who therefore never possessed German
                                nationality, and on his coming to Germany was to be solely regarded
                                an American citizen. With Alfred Meyer, on the other hand, the
                                acquisition of American citizenship was based solely on his birth in
                                the United States, while the naturalization of his father in America
                                could not be proved. According to investigations made, the latter
                                remained a Prussian subject until the time of his death. His son,
                                therefore, also possesses German nationality by descent, and if
                                through his birth in Baltimore he is considered by the American side
                                as at the same time an American citizen, it can only be stated that
                                through his double nationality he will have to fulfill his duties
                                toward both countries.</p>
                            <p>Touching the legal point of this so-called subjets mixtes, this
                                question has been more thoroughly treated in the case of Wizemann,
                                and the undersigned begs to refer to his note of the 23d ultimo.</p>
                            <p>If Alfred Meyer is to be regarded as a German subject according to
                                the laws prevailing in Germany on whom the regulations of the treaty
                                of February 22, 1868, can not be applied, he can not be liberated
                                from performing his military duty in Germany.</p>
                            <p>While the undersigned therefore is not, to his regret, in a position
                                to comply with the request made, he avails himself, etc.,</p>

                                    after performing military service in Prussia, emigrated in 1891
                                    to the United States, where he became naturalized as a citizen
                                    on the 27th of June last. In July he returned to Germany on a
                                    short visit to his parents, having left again early in
                                    September, and on the 22d of August he was, in order to avoid
                                    arrest and imprisonment, compelled to pay a fine of 50 marks, on
                                    account of his failure to report to the military authorities.
                                    The case was first brought to the attention of the embassy on
                                    August 26, 1896, and after investigating it, and after receiving
                                    from Nachtigall the evidence of his American citizenship, which
                                    he had not brought with him when he came from America,
                                    intervention was made on October 17 last (F. O. 110), which
                                    resulted in the refunding to Nachtigall of the money which he
                                    had been compelled to pay.</item>

                                    origin, applied to the embassy on January 8, 1897, for its aid
                                    in expediting a decision by the Prussian authorities as to
                                    whether or not certain money which he had been compelled to pay
                                    in order to avoid arrest on account of his not having performed
                                    military service was to be refunded to him. The embassy
                                    intervened at once (F. O. 150) with the result that a decision
                                    in Goldschmidt’s favor was given and the money in question
                                    returned to his representative in Breslau, Goldschmidt himself
                                    having gone back to the United States in the meantime.</item>

                                    emigrated in 1883 to the United States, where he became
                                    naturalized, at New York, on August 5, 1891. He returned to
                                    Germany on a visit to his relatives, and on the 14th of January
                                    last, intending to leave again, which intention he eventually
                                    carried out on February 23. On February 2 he was obliged to pay
                                    a fine of 1,000 marks in order to avoid arrest and imprisonment,
                                    on account of his failure to report himself for military duty.
                                    The case was brought to the attention of the embassy on February
                                    11, and, after preliminary investigation, intervention was made
                                    on the 15th (F. O. 178), with the result that the money paid by
                                    Goken was ordered to be refunded to his representative in
                                    Oldenburg early in March.</item>

                                    asked the intervention of the embassy to the end that the money
                                    which was to be refunded should be paid to his father, Mr. Nic
                                    Gillen, at Heisterberg. Application was accordingly made on
                                    December 31, 1896 (F. O. 144), and on March 21 the embassy was
                                    informed by Mr. Nic Gillen that he had received the
                                    money.</item>

                                <item>Fred Mossier, an American citizen of Alsatian origin, after an
                                    absence from Germany for several years, returned to his former
                                    home at Balbronn in December, 1896, and remained there, with the
                                    permission of the authorities, for about two months, engaged in
                                    settling the estate of his deceased grandfather. About the 24th
                                    of February Mr. Mossier left Alsace under the impression that he
                                    would be expelled if he should remain there any longer, and
                                    applied to the embassy for its good offices in obtaining
                                    permission to return and to remain at Balbronn for another
                                    month. The embassy at once acted upon his request (F. 0. 183),
                                    with the result that Mr. Mossier was able to return on March 7,
                                    and that permission has been granted him to remain until the 7th
                                    of April next.</item>

                                    embassy in a letter written from New York, which was received on
                                    June 14 last. He was born in Alsace-Lorraine in June, 1868, and
                                    had emigrated, after having obtained a release from German
                                    allegiance, to the United States in 1883, and he desired to
                                    revisit his former home. The embassy instructed him to make
                                    application to the proper authorities, and subsequently, upon
                                    his own request, permission was granted him to visit his home at
                                    Oberehnheim, and to remain there until August 2. On July 14 a
                                    second letter was received from him, in which he asked that the
                                    embassy would obtain for him an extension, so that he might
                                    remain in Germany for another month. The embassy, on the same

                                    on the 23d of the same month a reply was received, in which it
                                    was stated that Jehl might continue his visit until the 10th of

                                    was compelled to pay a fine of 250 marks, on account of his not

                                    stopping, and in spite of his protest as an American citizen and
                                    his presenting evidence of the fact that his emigration had been
                                    with the consent of the German authorities, he was conducted by
                                    force across the border into France. On August 15 last a letter
                                    was received from him by the embassy, in which he stated that
                                    the object of his return to Alsace was to see his relatives and
                                    to collect an inheritance which had come to him, and in which he
                                    asked that the embassy might endeavor to obtain for him
                                    permission to return and finish his business. The embassy at
                                    once addressed the foreign office on the subject (F. O. 52), and
                                    on the 8th ultimo a reply was received, in which it was stated
                                    that as Haag’s only relative in Alsace was an uncle, as his
                                    brothers and sisters live in America, where his parents died,
                                    and as he sold at auction, for cash, the farm land which had
                                    belonged to him on July 5 last, and had no other business
                                    interests at his former home in Morlenbach, there appeared to be
                                    no reason why he should be permitted to remain in that place,
                                    and consequently the “Statthalter” of Alsace-Lorraine declined
                                    to give him permission to return there.</item>

                                <item>Henry Kopcke was born in Germany, and emigrated to the United
                                    States, where he became naturalized as a citizen, at Chicago, on
                                    September 24, 1896. He subsequently informed the local
                                    authorities at his former home of this fact, and requested that
                                    his name be removed from the military lists and that a formal
                                    release from German allegiance be issued to him. In reply he was
                                    informed that his military leave of absence had been prolonged
                                    for two years. He thereupon brought his case to the attention of
                                    the embassy, and in a reply to a note which was addressed by it
                                    to the foreign office on June 28 last (F. O. 11), it was
                                    informed on the 27th ultimo that Kopcke’s name had been stricken
                                    from the list of those liable to be called upon for military
                                    service in Germany.</item>

                                <item>George Hey, in a letter dated August 16 last, informed the
                                    embassy that he had been impressed into German military service.
                                    In this letter he stated that he had been born in Germany, but
                                    had emigrated to the United States and had there become
                                    naturalized as an American citizen, and that his impressment had
                                    taken place while he was visiting his former home. As no
                                    evidence of American citizenship <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0238"/>accompanied his letter, however, it was
                                    referred to the acting consul-general at Frankfort, who sent it
                                    to the consul at Mayence, near which place Hey was serving. As
                                    the officers of the regiment said that nothing could be done in
                                    the case until after the maneuvers, and as letters to Hey
                                    remained unanswered, the embassy brought the case to the
                                    attention of the foreign office on the 17th ultimo (F. O. 77),
                                    and although no reply has as yet been received to this note, it
                                    has been learned that Hey was released from military service on
                                    the 29th ultimo.</item>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 24th instant, Sunday, I received
                            your telegraphic instruction, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                <p>New York Life Company is advised that Prussian council meets next
                                    week, and asks your offices to procure hearing before such
                                    council in behalf of American insurance companies. If the agents
                                    of the companies are prepared to go before such council in
                                    concert, with full statements and carefully prepared argument,
                                    you will use good unofficial offices to procure such
                                    hearing.</p>

                        <p>On the following morning I sent for and had a conference with Mr. von
                            Adelson, the local representative of the New York Life Insurance
                            Company, and informed him of the instruction received. To my question
                            whether he desired, on behalf of his company, to submit to the Prussian
                            ministry of state any further showing, either in the form of statement
                            or argument, he replied that he did not, that he had nothing additional
                            to present, and did not desire a hearing for such purpose. He farther
                            informed me that the companies in their presentation were not acting in
                            concert, but that each company had presented its case on its individual
                            merits. Of the result of this interview I advised you by telegraph as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    the form of statement or argument.</p>

                        <p>During the past seven months I have had frequent interviews with the
                            local representatives of the Mutual Life and New York Life insurance
                            companies, and more than once, while the examination was proceeding
                            before the ministry of the interior, asked such representatives whether
                            their several companies wished to make any presentation beyond that
                            already submitted, urging that if upon any point their cause could be
                            supplemented or strengthened it should be done at once. In each instance
                            their reply was that the case made was full and perfect, to which
                            nothing could be added.</p>
                        <p>It thus appearing from my interview with Mr. von Adelson that there was
                            no occasion to make application for a hearing as suggested before the
                            Prussian ministry, the remaining question, i. e., whether such request
                            would in any event be entertained, became unimportant. I understand,
                            however, that without a doubt it would not be met with favor.</p>

                            January 28 last, I have the honor to inform you that I took occasion
                            yesterday, when calling upon Baron von Marschall at the foreign office,
                            to inquire as to the present status of the long-pending application of
                            the American life insurance companies for readmission into Prussia, and
                            was informed by him that the records in each case had been considered in
                            the Prussian ministry of state, but that owing to the differences in the
                            opinions of the experts no conclusion had been reached upon the merits,
                            and it had consequently been determined to refer the entire records in
                            each case to another insurance expert, who is considered an especially
                            learned authority in treating the question involved in the inquiry. He
                            further said that the ministry would await a report from this expert
                            before taking final action.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Senator</hi>: May I ask your kind
                                offices in the matter of the pending application of the Mutual Life
                                Insurance Company of New York for readmission into the Kingdom of
                                Prussia.</p>
                            <p>Since my interview with you on this subject in March last there has
                                been no material change in the situation. The long-pending
                                application of the American life insurance companies for readmission
                                into Prussia was considered by the Prussian ministry, but no
                                conclusion reached.</p>
                            <p>The concession to the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York to do
                                business in Prussia was granted in November, 1886, but was canceled
                                by decree of that Government in 1892, although they had in the
                                meantime complied with all of the requirements of the Prussian
                                Government and spent a great deal of money in establishing their
                                business there, and erected a building in Berlin and invested in a
                                great many of the Prussian securities, relying upon the continuance
                                of the concession (which was unlimited in time), and they are now
                                and always have been willing to comply with all reasonable
                                conditions that the Prussian Government may impose.</p>
                            <p>As you are aware, the only avenue of approach to the Prussian
                                Government open to the company is through the State Department and
                                its ambassador to the German Government.</p>
                            <p>I now especially request that at your earliest convenience you will
                                personally bring the subject before the honorable Secretary of
                                State, and urge him to request the present ambassador, Mr. White, to
                                use his good offices in furthering the interests of American life
                                insurance companies in Germany and in obtaining favorable action
                                upon the pending application for readmission to transact business in
                                Prussia.</p>
                            <p>The entire history of this subject and all the correspondence between
                                the State Department and the German Government will be found in
                                Senate Doc. No. 140, the publication of which you so kindly
                                procured, copy of which I inclose. The letter of the president of
                                the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, commencing on page 4
                                of that document, gives the history of the entire case, and many
                                cogent reasons why the concession should not have been canceled.</p>

                            <p>The American life insurance interests are of great importance and the
                                action of the Prussian Government in canceling the concession of the
                                three largest companies, the Mutual Life of New York, the New York
                                Life, and the Equitable Life, has already done great damage to these
                                interests, and the continued refusal or delay in acting upon the
                                question of renewing the concessions is a serious matter, and you
                                will be conferring a great favor not only upon me personally, but
                                upon the officers of the Mutual Life and its policy holders
                                throughout the world, by assisting in obtaining through the State
                                Department the renewal of this concession by the Prussion
                                Government, as their refusal to grant permission to do business
                                there not only prevents doing business in that country, but
                                unfavorably affects the business throughout the whole of Europe.</p>
                            <p>Thanking you in advance for this great favor, and hoping that you
                                will find it consistent with your duties to give the matter your
                                personal attention, I beg to remain, Very sincerely, yours,</p>

                                correspondence has been exchanged with Ambassador Uhl since Senate

                                situation. When the lately commissioned ambassador, Mr. Andrew D.

                                Prussia, and Mr. White fully understands that he will be expected to

                                action of the Prussian Government.</p>

                            <p>In the course of a conversation at the Imperial foreign office on
                                April 20 last His Excellency Baron von Marsehall informed Ambassador
                                Uhl that the applications of the American life insurance companies
                                for readmission into Prussia had been considered by the Royal
                                ministry of state, but that owing to differences in the opinions of
                                the experts by whom reports had been submitted no conclusion had
                                been reached upon the merits of the case, and that it had
                                consequently been determined to refer the entire records in each
                                case to another insurance expert, who is considered an especially
                                learned authority in treating the question involved in the inquiry.
                                Baron von Marschall further said that the ministry would await a
                                report from this expert before taking final action.</p>

                                received and considered by the Prussian ministry, and, if it should
                                be ascertained that such was not the case, to request that his
                                excellency will kindly cause the necessary steps to be taken toward
                                rendering a decision in this matter, which has been pending for
                                about two years, and which, in the United States, is considered as
                                one of much importance, where expedition is greatly to be
                                desired.</p>

                            <p>The undersigned has the honor to inform his excellency the ambassador

                                Mr. Edwin F. Uhl, in reply to his note No. 198, of the 17th instant,
                                that the circular regulations issued on the 6th instant by the Royal
                                Prussian ministers of justice, the interior, and war deal with the
                                formal treatment of the petitions for pardon sent in by persons who
                                have been sentenced on account of their having evaded military
                                service. These regulations direct the local officials to see that
                                these petitions contain, at first instance, all that is worth
                                knowing about the case in point, and everything in regard to it of a
                                nature to influence the decision of the highest authority, in order
                                that the delays which would result, if additional information had to
                                be sought, may be avoided. No change is made by these regulations in
                                the principles heretofore observed by the Royal Prussian Government
                                in regard to the action of the police toward the persons in
                                question, in particular to the treatment of former German subjects
                                who have returned to Germany after naturalization in the United
                                States of America.</p>

                                to the end that the Royal Prussian Government may bring to the
                                attention of the minor executive officials, Landräthe,
                                Amtsvorsteher, etc., as suggested by Mr. Jackson in a conversation
                                with His Excellency Baron von Rotenhan in July, 1895, the circular
                                instructions of the Royal Prussian ministers of justice and of the

                                Confederation, as well as the decision of the Imperial supreme court
                                at Leipzig of January 20, 1896 (Entsch. d. R. G. in Strafs., Bd. 28,
                                S. 127), in order that naturalized American citizens of German
                                origin may not be subjected to unnecessary annoyance and molestation
                                by local authorities, on account of their having emigrated without

                            <p>In response to the note of the 29th ultimo, F. O. 203, the
                                undersigned has the honor to inform his excellency the ambassador
                                extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the United States of America,
                                returning the inclosures therein transmitted, that the appropriate
                                authorities have already, in 1868, received instructions in regard
                                to the carrying out of article 2 of the decrees of the ministers of
                                justice of July 5 and of the interior of July 6, of that year of the
                                so-called Bancroft treaty. Later on the contents of these decrees
                                were again brought to their attention. As the decision of the
                                Imperial court of January 20, 1896 (Penal Gases, vol. 28, p. 127),
                                referred to by the ambassador, coincides with the principles laid
                                down in the decrees in question, and also with the carrying out of
                                the same, and as no case wherein these principles have been violated
                                has lately been brought to the attention of this office, there does
                                not seem to be sufficient reason to again call the attention of the
                                appropriate authorities to the instructions heretofore given. If
                                naturalized German-Americans were at different times sentenced for
                                the violation of military duty, and these cases were made the
                                subject of discussion, this was caused by the fact that the
                                authorities did not know that those persons were naturalized in
                                America, and the sentence was at all times revoked wherever this

                            report, with accompanying schedules and note by Mr. Squiers, second
                            secretary of the embassy, showing the operation in detail of the treaty
                            of February 22, 1868, between the United States and the North German
                            Confederation, as well as of the naturalization treaties made with other
                            German states at about the same time, which is self-explanatory and
                            which I am quite confident the Department will find of value.</p>
                        <p>It is the result of a careful examination in detail of the embassy’s
                            records during the period embraced and a classification as

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In accordance with your verbal
                                instructions, I beg to hand you a report on the working of the
                                treaty of February 22, 1868, between the United States and the North
                                German Confederation. Naturalization treaties were made with other
                                German States at about the same time. All cases coming under any of
                                the various treaties are included.</p>
                            <p>For your convenience I have drawn the report in a tabulated form
                                showing: (1) Name; (2) age at emigration; (3) date of emigration;
                                (4) date of naturalization; (5) date of return to Germany; (6) date
                                of intervention; (7) ground for intervention; (8) result of
                                intervention.</p>
                            <p>In further tables I have consolidated the data collected under each
                                of the above heads.</p>
                            <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0246"/>
                            <p>You will find a total of 447 cases presented between the 23d of
                                April, 1868, and the 7th of April, 1897, a period of nearly
                                twenty-nine years. Of these, 48 were Alsace-Lorraine and 88
                                Schleswig-Holstein cases. (Inclosures Nos. 1 and 2.)</p>
                            <p>The age at emigration is significant. Under the German law the names
                                of all those who have passed their seventeenth year are placed on
                                the military list, where they remain until the twenty-eighth year is
                                passed. Of the 447 cases, 316 emigrated between the ages of 16 and
                                22. (Inclosure 3.)</p>
                            <p>The length of residence in the United States before naturalization,
                                and in many cases the almost immediate return thereafter to Germany,
                                is also very significant. Two hundred and five cases out of 375
                                whose records are known were naturalized within six years after
                                emigration, while 212 out of 381 returned to their native country
                                within two years after naturalization. (Inclosure 4.)</p>
                            <p>Of the 447 cases presented, 325 were decided favorably. Many
                                expulsion cases were decided unfavorably, and especially those
                                expelled from Schleswig-Holstein. In cases 5, 6, 7, 15, and 319 I
                                have been unable to find any reply to note of intervention.
                                (Inclosures 5 and 6.)</p>
                            <p>Many of the dates are missing. In cases of arrest or of compulsory
                                service the certificate of naturalization was generally taken up by
                                the authorities and, when the case was finally decided, returned
                                direct. For this reason the details were not recorded.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatches, Nos. 233 and 241, of the
                            respective dates of January 8 and 11 last, communicated the result of
                            inquiries made by you concerning a publication in a local newspaper
                            touching the reported issuance by the “Regierungs-Präsident,” at
                            Potsdam, of an order limiting the sojourn in his district of returning
                            naturalized American citizens of German origin. It then appeared that
                            the regulations which had been issued by the Prussian Government in this
                            regard were not intended to be made public and that they contained
                            nothing more than a declaration of the policy which has frequently been
                            indicated in the correspondence between the embassy and the foreign
                            office.</p>
                        <p>Within a few days past another press notice, apparently based on
                            telegraphic intelligence, has circulated, reading as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Prussian minister of the interior has issued a new decree,
                                    permitting only a brief stay here of any German naturalized in
                                    America who returns to this country. They were formerly allowed
                                    to remain here permanently, provided no questions of military
                                    dereliction on their part were involved. The liberal press
                                    points out that this decree amounts to a nullification of the
                                    treaty stipulations of 1868, whereby the permanent return of
                                    naturalized German-Americans was specially guaranteed. The
                                    liberal leaders, Herren Richter and Ricken, and others, will
                                    question the Government on the subject in the Reichstag, and
                                    that body will thoroughly discuss the decree.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>This notice appears to have been recently current in the German papers,
                            for it is reported in a dispatch from the United States consul at
                            Annaberg, dated April 13 last, of which a copy is appended for your
                            information.</p>
                        <p>These several statements may simply reproduce the publication of November
                            last, to which you have heretofore referred, but there is nothing to
                            indicate that they may not relate to some new and formal notification.
                            However this may be, it has naturally attracted attention, and the
                            Department has had several inquiries on the subject.</p>
                        <p>The notoriety attaching to the reported circular, the reference thereto
                            in widely separated districts of Germany, and the foreshadowed
                            discussion of the subject in the Imperial Parliament, coupled with the
                            virtual admission of the foreign office that something of the kind had
                            in fact been issued by the Prussian Government, although not intended
                            for publicity, suggests that the text of such order may now be known or
                            may not now be inaccessible to you. If a copy can be procured the
                            Department would like to have it, as it may afford a convenient summary
                            of the views of the Prussian Government on a subject which has
                            occasioned extensive correspondence between the two countries for many
                            years past.</p>
                        <p>In this relation I send, for your more convenient information, copy of a
                                dispatch<note n="1" xml:id="d199fn1">Not printed.</note> from Mr.
                            Louis Stern, the United States commercial agent at Bamberg, reporting

                            Hirnheimer 200 marks for imputed evasion of military service, and the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that in
                            last night’s issue of the Berliner Correspondenz, No. 93, a news sheet
                            published by the Prussian ministry of the interior, the report, as
                            referred to, which has recently appeared in the press, that new
                            regulations have been issued by that ministry, according to which the
                            provisions in regard to the sojourn in Prussia of naturalized Americans
                            who were formerly German subjects are made considerably more severe, and
                            the statement is made that this report is entirely without foundation,
                            and that the regulations in regard to the temporary residence in Prussia
                            of these so-called German Americans which were issued several years ago
                            still remain in force without change.</p>

                            last, in reply to an inquiry from the embassy on the subject (see my
                            dispatch No. 233, of January 8, 1897), and that I was informed that the
                            regulations (see dispatch No. 241, of January 14) referred to were
                            issued between 1880 and 1890, and were not intended to be made

                            instruction No. 386, of the 3d instant, in regard to the treatment in
                            Germany of returning naturalized American citizens of German origin, I
                            have the honor to respectfully refer to my dispatch No. 345, of May 11,
                            1897.</p>
                        <p>The origin of the press notice referred to in your instruction I am
                            unable to ascertain, but it is my opinion that the Prussian Government
                            has not changed its views on this subject, and that the circular
                            mentioned merely calls the attention of local officials to the
                            provisions of former regulations. What these views are is shown in a
                            note from Count Hatzfeldt, dated May 16, 1885, which appears on <ref target="frus1885#pg_417">page 417 of the Foreign Relations for
                                1885</ref>, and in which it is stated that— <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>In the intercourse of the Empire with other States, the view has
                                    been heretofore always and quite universally adhered to that by
                                    treaty provisions of this character (Article 1 of the treaty
                                    between the United States and Prussia of 1828), the
                                    internationally recognized right of every State to remove
                                    foreigners from its territory when their further sojourn in the
                                    country appears to be undersirable, upon grounds of the welfare
                                    of the State, is not abolished. This applies in a peculiar
                                    measure to the sons born in America of former German subjects,
                                    when they live with their fathers permanently in Germany,
                                    participate like Germans in all arrangements for the protection
                                    and welfare of the subjects of the Empire, and only make use of
                                    their American citizenship to avoid the fulfillment of one of
                                    the most important duties of German subjects. Continued
                                    toleration of such endeavors would necessarily lead to the
                                    formation within the Empire of a numerous group of population
                                    who illustrate by their example how it is possible, under the
                                    covering mantle of a foreign nationality, held by name only, to
                                    evade in a whole succession of generations the military duty
                                    imposed upon all.”</p>

                                of your letter of the 9th instant and thanks you for the copy of
                                your report to the State Department in the case of Baruch
                                Hirnheimer, which was therein inclosed.</p>
                            <p>The decision of the supreme court at Leipzig is of interest in this
                                case because it confirms former decisions and is in line with the
                                policy of the executive officials of the various governments of
                                Germany in similar cases. Had Mr. Hirnheimer applied to the embassy
                                for assistance, instead of to the courts, the result would have been
                                the same, and he would have been spared the trouble of a
                                lawsuit.</p>

                            <p>The undersigned ambassador, etc., of the United States of America has
                                the honor to invite the attention of his excellency Baron von
                                Rotenhan, acting secretary of state for foreign affairs, to the case
                                of Casimir Hartmann, a naturalized American citizen, born in
                                Alsace.</p>
                            <p>The embassy is informed that when about 15 years of age, in May,
                                1886, Hartmann was taken by his mother to the United States, and
                                that about five years ago he became naturalized as a citizen there.
                                In July last the family returned to Alt-Lixheim, in Alsace, where
                                Hartmann’s mother owns property. On August 1, 1896, Hartmann was
                                arrested and taken to Finstingen, where he was kept in prison for
                                two days and then released. On November 9 he was again arrested and
                                taken to Saarburg, but was almost immediately set free again. On
                                December 28 he was for the third time arrested and was taken to
                                Saargemund, from there to Gottingen, and eventually to Goslar, where
                                he was impressed into the Prussian military service, and where he is
                                now said to be serving as a soldier in the Seventh Company of the
                                Second Hessian Infantry Regiment, No. 82, his American papers having
                                been taken from him.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned has the honor to request that his excellency will
                                kindly cause this case to be investigated at once, and that, if the
                                facts therein are found to be substantially as stated, his
                                excellency will further use his good offices to effect the immediate
                                release of this American citizen from enforced military service in
                                Germany, and to obtain the return to him of the certificate of his
                                American naturalization.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my dispatch No. 240, of
                            January 13 last, I have the honor to inform you that Casimir Hartmann
                            was discharged from enforced service in the German army on the 10th
                            instant, and that he is now sojourning with his mother in
                            Alsace-Lorraine.</p>
                        <p>This case was brought to the attention of the embassy by the United
                            States consulate at Kehl, Baden, in a letter which was received on
                            January 13 last, and, as the Department has already been informed,
                            intervention, looking to the immediate release of Hartmann from military
                            service, was at once made. As no reply had been received to my first
                            note, I again addressed the foreign office on the subject on February 1,
                            calling attention to the fact that, in addition to his having become an
                            American citizen, Hartman had, according to German law, lost his German
                            allegiance through a residence of more than ten years abroad. No reply
                            still having been received, I addressed the foreign office again on
                            February 11 and 20, and on or about February 26 I called in person on
                            Baron von Marschall and urged the importance of an early reply in the
                            case.</p>
                        <p>In explanation of the delay I was informed that the investigation of the
                            case was being made by the Imperial Statthalter of Alsace-Lorraine, and
                            that a reply would be sent as soon as his report was received. No reply
                            still being forthcoming, I again wrote to the foreign office on March 5,
                            and on the 14th I was informed in writing that one would soon be made.
                            On the 10th instant his promised reply was received, in which it is
                            stated that the authorities have recognized the fact that Hartmann is a
                            foreigner, and that consequently his discharge from service in the
                            German army had been ordered.</p>
                        <p>Through the consulate at Kehl I have to day learned that on the 10th
                            instant, after about three months’ obligatory service in the Second
                            Hessian Infantry Regiment, No. 82, Hartmann was set at liberty.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to previous correspondence, I
                            have the honor to inform you that on May 22 last the embassy learned
                            through the United States consul at Kehl that Casimir Hartmann, whose
                            American citizenship had been recognized after certain correspondence
                            between the embassy and the German foreign office, and who had been
                            released from service in the German army in April last, after having
                            been held thereto for about-three months, had been ordered to leave the
                            country by the “Bezirks-Prasident” of Lorraine.</p>
                        <p>Hartmann, whose two older brothers emigrated to the United States after
                            having performed military service in Germany, and who at the time of his
                            own emigration, more than ten years ago, was too young for such service,
                            came back to Germany with his mother, in order to assist her to
                            reestablish herself in Altlixheim, in Lorraine, and it is his intention
                            to return to America when this is done, and, acting upon his request,
                            the embassy at once applied for permission for him to remain with his
                            mother for a year.</p>
                        <p>On May 31 a telegram was received from Mrs. Hartmann, to say that her son
                            was being taken to the frontier, and renewed intervention was thereupon
                            immediately made at the foreign office, with the result that a telegram
                            was sent to the imperial statthalter at Strassburg, on the same day,
                            asking him not to allow Hartmann to be molested before a final decision
                            in his case had been made, and on June 3 this information was
                            communicated to Mrs. Hartmann, from whom nothing has since been
                            heard.</p>
                        <p>To-day I am in receipt of a note from the foreign office, in which it is
                            stated that the statthalter has granted permission for Hartmann to
                            remain in Altlixheim for one year.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that in
                            February last a letter was received from a Mr. Jonas Lippmann, in which
                            he asked that the embassy give its support to a petition which he had
                            addressed to the Imperial statthalter of Alsace-Lorraine, asking for the
                            removal of an attachment which had been put upon certain property coming
                            to him from his deceased mother, in order to secure the payment of a
                            fine of 600 marks, to which he had been sentenced on account of his
                            failure to perform military service in Germany, and that on February 24
                            last I addressed a note to the German foreign office in the case, a copy
                            of which is inclosed herein.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lippmann was born in Alsace and emigrated, with the permission of the
                            German authorities, from whom he obtained a certificate of release from
                            allegiance, to the United States, where he duly became naturalized as a
                            citizen. He subsequently returned to Europe, remained for a year or two
                            in his former home, and then established himself in business in
                            Brussels, where he at present resides. In 1888, after he had left Alsace
                            for the second time, he was sentenced by the court <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0267"/>at Strassburg to pay the fine
                            complained of, and later, upon the death of his mother, property left by
                            her was attached.</p>
                        <p>A reply to my note has now been received, and I have the honor to I
                            transmit herewith a translation of the same, as well as a copy of a
                            second, note, which, after communicating with Mr. Lippmann, I have
                            to-day sent to the Imperial foreign office in the case, and to be, sir,
                            etc.,</p>

                                the good offices of the Imperial foreign office in behalf of Mr.
                                Jonas Lippmann, who was born in Elsass, who emigrated to the United

                                there became naturalized as a citizen in 1879, and who has recently
                                addressed a petition to the Imperial statthalter, asking for the
                                removal of an attachment which has been put upon certain property
                                coming to him from his deceased mother at Weissenburg as security
                                for the payment of a fine of 600 marks, to which he has been
                                sentenced on account of his failure to perform military service in

                            <p>Referring to the note verbale of the 24th of February last (F. O.
                                184), the foreign office has the honor to inform the embassy of the
                                United States of America that the Imperial statthalter of
                                Alsace-Lorraine does not find it permissible to comply with the
                                request of Jonas Lippmann to release a piece of property at
                                Weissenburg which belonged to the estate of his mother, and which
                                had been attached in order that the amount of the fine (600 marks
                                and costs) be served, to which he had been sentenced by the
                                landgericht at Strassburg on March 3, 1888, for avoidance of
                                military duty. On a petition for pardon made by Lippmann he was, as
                                early as the year 1892, asked to furnish authoritative proof that he
                                still possesses American nationality and that he possessed this
                                nationality in 1887. This demand he has not complied with. The
                                following has been ascertained as to his private affairs:</p>
                            <p>Jonas Lippmann, born on April 15, 1858, was, on November 27, 1874, on
                                a petition made by his father, released from Alsace-Lorraine
                                nationality, and immediately thereafter emigrated to the United
                                States of America, where he became naturalized in 1879; but as early
                                as August, 1884, he returned to the place of his present residence,
                                Strassburg, and has made it his permanent home. He held the position
                                of a clerk in <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0268"/>the
                                beginning, but after his marriage, which took place in 1887, he
                                became a partner in the dry goods business of his mother-in-law. As
                                it was to be assumed that he, in accordance with the spirit of
                                article 4 of the treaty of February 22, 1868, after making Alsace
                                his permanent home, had renounced his American citizenship, the
                                possession of which it was impossible for him to prove, it was
                                ordered in 1887, in accordance with legal regulations, that he be
                                mustered into the army. But Lippmann neither presented himself for
                                examination in the spring of 1887 nor to the special mustering out
                                of the same year, but went off on a journey. In November, 1887, he
                                made his home in Paris. After being asked to return to Germany he
                                was, as stated above, sentenced, and measures have now been adopted
                                to collect the fine and costs of said proceeding.</p>
                            <p>The foreign office regrets that under these circumstances the wish of
                                the embassy can not be complied with.</p>

                            <p>Referring to the esteemed note verbale of the 27th ultimo, the
                                undersigned, ambassador, etc., of the United States of America, has
                                the honor to invite the attention of His Excellency Baron Marsehall
                                von Bieberstein, Imperial secretary of state for foreign affairs, to
                                the statement made in the note from the Imperial foreign office, of
                                January 25, 1896, in the case of the American citizen Johann (Emil)
                                Baptiste Kauffmann, in regard to the extension of the treaty of
                                February 22, 1868, to Alsace-Lorraine, and, while stating that it
                                can hardly be expected for the United States Government to advance
                                or admit the proposition that the existing treaties of
                                naturalization are not applicable to the case of a former resident
                                of these provinces, ventures to call attention to the apparent lack
                                of consistency on the part of the Imperial Government in declining
                                to apply these treaties in the one case, where benefit would result
                                from such application to the American citizen, and in spontaneously
                                applying them in the other case to the detriment of the person
                                concerned.</p>
                            <p>According to the laws of the United States, American citizenship is
                                lost only by a voluntary renunciation of the same or through the
                                acquisition of another nationality, and not, except in cases which
                                are governed by treaty provisions, through residence abroad for any
                                given length of time; and that Jonas Lippmann in 1893 was still
                                considered an American citizen is shown by the inclosed passport,
                                which was issued to him by the United States minister at Brussels on
                                January 16 of that year. From Mr. Lippmann the embassy learns that
                                he never knew of any request by the authorities of Alsace-Lorraine
                                in 1892, or at any other time, for him to furnish proof that he was
                                still a citizen of the United States, and this statement seems
                                credible, as it would have been a simple matter for him to have
                                complied with such a request. Mr. Lippmann further states that since
                                1887 he has resided in Brussels, where he is engaged in business,
                                and that he had already left Alsace-Lorraine—after his return and
                                temporary residence there after his naturalization in the United
                                States in 1884—before the sentence now complained of had been
                                passed.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned therefore requests that his excellency will kindly
                                    <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0269"/>cause this case to be

                                as may be required to prevent the execution of the order which has
                                recently been served upon the father of Mr. Lippmann, at
                                Weissenburg, to pay, “within eight days,” the fine of 677 marks,
                                under certain penalties in case of failure to do so; and in view of
                                the fact that Mr. Lippmann had been released from German allegiance
                                and had become an American citizen before the date of the sentence
                                of the Landgerichs at Strassburg, and that he has not in the
                                meantime reacquired German nationality and the consequent liability
                                to military service, he further requests the good offices of the
                                Imperial Government to the end that the attachment complained of may
                                be removed and all proceedings against Mr. Lippmann may be brought
                                to a close.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received and read with interest
                            your dispatch No. 338, of the 4th instant, in relation to the military
                            case of Jonas Lippmann, whose proper in Alsace-Lorraine had been
                            attached in order to secure the payment of a fine of 600 marks to which
                            he had been sentenced on account of his failure to perform military
                            service in Germany.</p>
                        <p>It appears from the statements of your dispatch and its accompaniments
                            that Mr. Lippmann, having been born in Alsace-Lorraine, obtained from
                            the German authorities a certificate of release from German allegiance
                            and subsequently emigrated to the United States, where he duly became
                            naturalized as a citizen. His case, therefore, stands not only on the
                            rights accorded by our treaties with Germany so far as they may be
                            claimed by us and allowed by the Imperial Government, but his express
                            release from German allegiance is essentially in point.</p>
                        <p>The reply to your representations rests particularly upon the technical
                            objection that Mr. Lippmann had failed to furnish authoritative proof
                            that he still possesses American nationality and that he possessed this
                            nationality in 1887; and partly on the assumed right of the Imperial
                            authorities to apply to him the presumptions raised under article 4 of
                            the treaty between the United States and the North German Union of
                            February 22, 1868, respecting his return to and continued residence in
                            the country of origin. You have met the allegation of Mr. Lippmann’s
                            failure to evidence his continued American citizenship by adducing his
                            passport issued in 1893. I desire, also, to commend the point you make
                            in calling attention to the apparent lack of consistency on the part of
                            the Imperial Government in declining to apply the German treaties of
                            naturalization with the United States in the one case where benefit
                            would result from such application to the American citizen and in
                            spontaneously applying them in the other case to the detriment of the
                            person concerned.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lippmann’s case deserves continued, and it is hoped eventually
                            successful, intervention of the embassy.</p>

                                    Relations, 1896, p. 187</ref>.</note> of March 3, 1896, from Mr.
                            Olney to Mr. Jackson, upon the subject of the existing treaties in
                            regard to naturalization between the United States and the German
                            States, with particular reference to Alsace-Lorraine, I beg to say that
                            not long after reaching my post I brought the matter to the attention of
                            His Excellency Baron Marschall von Bieberstein, imperial Germ an
                            secretary of state for foreign affairs.</p>
                        <p>In an interview with him on the 23d day of December last I again referred
                            to the subject, and requested that after consideration he would advise
                            me of the views of his Government with reference to undertaking the
                            negotiation of a new treaty. He, in general terms, expressed himself as
                            favorable to a consideration of the question, and made a memorandum
                            thereof, with the statement that after examining it he would confer with
                            me further.</p>
                        <p>A few days since I again, at the foreign office, spoke with his
                            excellency as to the matter, and was informed by him that he had not as
                            yet been able to give the same such attention as he desired preparatory
                            to a discussion thereof.</p>
                        <p>In this connection you have not failed to note my contention as to the
                            attitude of the German Government with reference to the application of
                            existing treaties to Alsace-Lorraine, in my note to the foreign office

                            to his case, a letter has been received from Mr. Jonas Lippmann, in
                            which he states that he has had a letter from the first imperial state’s
                            attorney at Strassburg, saying that he had “been illegally considered by
                            him as German citizen, and that it is by mistake” that he had been
                            sentenced for not having served in the German army. Mr. Lippmann adds
                            that he was informed in the same letter “that the seizure made on his
                            motherly fortune is not legal and will not he maintained.”</p>

                                an alleged discrimination prejudicial to the commercial interests of
                                the United States in the matter of freight tariffs on certain woods
                                exported from the United States, imposed by the managements of the
                                railroads under the control of the German governments, the
                                undersigned, ambassador, etc., of the United States of America, has
                                the honor to inform His Excellency Baron von Rotenhan, acting
                                secretary of state for foreign affairs, that it has recently been
                                brought to his knowledge that a decision favorable to the American
                                interests has just been made by the “Kammer fur Handelssachen” in
                                Cassel, and that in a suit brought by the firm M. B. Bodenheim, of
                                that place, [against] the Railway “Fiscus,” it has been ordered that
                                the excessive freight charged on American woods is to be returned.
                                In two cases, however, in suits brought by Carl Gartner, of Hamburg,
                                before the Oberlandesgericht at Karlsruhe, and the Amtsgericht at
                                Erfurt, decisions (from which it is understood appeals have been

                            <p>Referring to the notes of the 1st ultimo and the 13th instant (128
                                and 153), the undersigned has the honor to inform his excellency the
                                ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the United States of
                                America, Mr. Edwin F. Uhl, that he at that time acquainted the
                                appropriate home authorities with the contents of General Runyon’s
                                note of the 9th of March, 1894, regarding the tariff rates placed on
                                American woods on German state railways.</p>
                            <p>These authorities at that time had already considered, on account of
                                complaints made by German importers of American woods, whether the
                                German railway freight tariff of the state railways covering these
                                points ought to be altered or applied differently than heretofore.
                                These considerations, in which the contents of the aforesaid note
                                were borne in mind, have, however, reached their termination in the
                                conclusion to leave the wording and application of the tariff
                                applied as heretofore. Such <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0273"/>kinds of wood will, therefore, as has heretofore been the case,
                                whenever they are not subject to cultivation for commercial purposes
                                in middle Europe, as for instance certain kinds of American oak and
                                pine, be compelled to pay the higher rate according to Special
                                Tariff I. The undersigned can not, however, find that there is a
                                differential treatment in this, as is alleged in the note of March
                                9, 1894. Not the fact that the wood grew and was cut in America
                                caused its falling under the higher freight rate of Special Tariff
                                I, but the fact that it belongs to a special species of that class
                                (genera) which is not cultivated for commercial purposes in middle
                                Europe. For the rest, the difference between certain kinds of middle
                                European and American oak and pine which have been considered in the
                                various tariffs is not only as stated of a purely botanical but also
                                of a financial nature, as it is well known that the different kinds
                                of American as well as other foreign wood which generally come into
                                question and which pay a higher tariff are of a greater value than
                                those growing in middle Europe. Moreover, it is just this ratio of
                                value which at the time caused the classification of goods, for
                                railway tariff purposes as for other reasons, which led to the
                                creation of tariff “positions” for woods. Only on account of the
                                difficulty of specifying the different kinds of valuable woods, and
                                on account of the possibility that through continued introduction of
                                new kinds this list might become incomplete, was it thought best
                                that this general expression be chosen and maintained in this part
                                of the tariff, which, it is true, might lead to the misconception
                                that the different kinds of wood are treated differently, not on
                                account of their species, but on account of the place from which
                                they come.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned regrets that he can not under the circumstances give
                                any assurance that there will be a change in the rates of tariff on
                                the different kinds of American wood, but expresses the hope that
                                the foregoing explanation will convince the Government of the United
                                States that neither the existing tariff nor its execution carries
                                with it a differential treatment of wood of American origin.</p>
                            <p>As nothing is known at this office regarding the decisions of the
                                courts regarding tariff rates on American wood, as mentioned in the
                                note of the 13th instant, the undersigned permits himself to reserve
                                a further reply upon this point, after the necessary investigations
                                have been made.</p>

                            <p>The undersigned, ambassador of the United States of America, has the
                                honor to again invite the attention of His Excellency Baron
                                Marsehall von Bieberstein, imperial secretary of state for foreign
                                affairs, to the subject of an alleged discrimination adverse to the
                                interests of citizens of the United States by the Prussian railway
                                management in the matter of the collection of freight tariffs upon
                                woods imported from the United States into Germany and transported
                                over railways under Government control, and to inform his excellency
                                that he has communicated the substance of the note of His Excellency
                                Baron von Rotenhan, of the 22d ultimo, in relation thereto, to
                                certain parties interested and engaged in shipping such American
                                woods in Germany, and that after conference with these parties, and
                                after a careful review and examination of the subject, including the
                                opinions of German experts, the judgments of certain courts before
                                which the question of such alleged discrimination has been raised
                                and which have judicially passed upon the same, the undersigned is
                                unable to agree with the conclusion reached by Baron von Rotenhan,
                                as set forth in the said note, to wit, that neither the existing
                                tariff, nor its execution, carries with it a differential treatment
                                of wood of American origin. On the contrary, the <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0275"/>undersigned is convinced that the
                                present interpretation of the tariff by the Prussian railway
                                management does result in an adverse and unjustifiable
                                discrimination against woods imported from the United States, to the
                                pecuniary disadvantage and injury of American citizens.</p>
                            <p>The asserted right to collect higher tariff in the transportation of
                                American oak and pine than is collected from the oak and pine grown
                                in middle Europe seems to rest upon the following hypotheses: <list>
                                    <item>First. That these American woods belong to a particular
                                        species of a general class or genus, which general class is
                                        common to America and middle Europe, but which particular
                                        species is not cultivated for commercial purposes in middle
                                        Europe, and that there is a refined botanical distinction or
                                        difference between the American oak and pine and those of
                                        middle Europe, detected only in the appearance of the
                                        blossoms, leaves, or needles of the living tree, but not
                                        apparent or discoverable in the log, plank, timber, or
                                        lumber cut from the same.</item>
                                    <item>Second. That these woods of American origin are of greater
                                        value than those of middle Europe.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>As to the “first” above, the undersigned is advised and persuaded
                                that it can with positiveness be asserted that there is no material
                                or substantial difference whatever between the American product and
                                that of middle Europe, and that no expert can distinguish an
                                American oak or pine plank or board from one cut from a tree which
                                grew in middle Europe. The undersigned is informed that not long
                                since Mr. Carl Gartner, who is and has been for several years
                                extensively engaged in shipping American lumber over Prussian
                                railways, consigned certain Galician oak from Hamburg to Lennep, and
                                that the railway management caused a sample to be taken from the car
                                containing such shipment and placed it in the hands of an expert for
                                examination, who certified, as such expert, that the sample so
                                examined was American oak, whereas in truth it was cut from oak
                                grown in Galicia.</p>
                            <p>As to the “second” point, the undersigned is assured that the
                                American oak, pine, and maple are not of a greater value than the
                                corresponding woods of middle Europe and that they do not sell for a
                                higher price in the market; that they are devoted to the same use
                                and have the same appearance; that they are not heavier, and that
                                both belong to the same family. Some American oak is inferior to
                                that of middle Europe, some is of equal value, but none is more
                                valuable. In certain instances, according to the opinions of German
                                experts, American white oak has been found of equal value to that of
                                middle Europe, but not of a higher grade, either in its technical
                                quality or the uses to which it is devoted, while the great part of
                                American oak has been pronounced of inferior value.</p>
                            <p>In many contested causes in the German courts, in which testimony has
                                been received as to these woods, German experts have given it as
                                their opinion that the American pine and oak are at best of equal
                                value to the oak and pine of middle Europe, and this conclusion has
                                been reached from technical examination as to durability, hardness,
                                and elasticity, from the uses to which the woods are devoted, from
                                the prices L at which they sell, and from their specific weight. As
                                to this, according to the authority of Forstmeister Dr. Jentsch,
                                instructor in the Royal Academy of Forestry at Munden, American oak
                                has a specific gravity of from 0.747 to 1.01, while that of German
                                oak varies from 0.87 to 1.28.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned respectfully submits that it is entirely illogical
                                and unjustifiable that in the application of the freight tariff’ a
                                distinction should be made whereby, by reason of a refined and
                                technical difference, <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0276"/>apparent only upon examination of the living tree, American oak,
                                pine, maple, and ash are required to pay a higher rate than the
                                corresponding product of Russia, Austria, or Servia, because,
                                forsooth, the leaves, blossoms, or needles of the living American
                                trees differ slightly in appearance from those of middle Europe.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned has been informed that the proprietors of a large
                                barrel factory, under the firm name of the M. B. Bodenheim
                                Fassfabrik, at Cassel, has recently sued for and recovered the sum
                                of about 8,000 marks, which represented the excess collected from
                                him, according to the interpretation of the tariff hereby complained
                                of, by the railway management upon certain American oak staves,
                                which it was impossible to distinguish from the staves of middle
                                Europe, the excess having been exacted upon the ground that the
                                leaves or blossoms of the living American tree from which the staves
                                were cut might have differed in appearance from the leaves or
                                blossoms of the oak trees growing in middle Europe.</p>
                            <p>It is beyond doubt that, in formulating the tariff schedule in
                                question, it was the intention of the framers thereof that only such
                                woods as were used in the manufacture of valuable and expensive
                                articles—for instance, mahogany, ebony, rosewood, etc.—should be
                                subject to the imposition of the higher rate, upon the ground that,
                                as the manufactured product represented a large valuation, it was
                                but just that the raw material should be submitted to the payment of
                                a higher rate than woods to be devoted to the manufacture of
                                inexpensive articles. It will not for a moment be contended that oak
                                and pine are employed in the manufacture of exceptionally rare or
                                expensive articles.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned is informed that formerly these American woods were
                                not subjected to the payment of the higher tariff rate now imposed,
                                but that the present interpretation only obtained in recent years 5
                                and he is unable to comprehend upon what principle the exaction of a
                                transportation rate upon a shipment of American oak or pine 50 per
                                cent higher than upon a like shipment of Russian oak or pine of the
                                same dimensions, the same weight, the same grade or quality, the
                                same appearance, the same value, and devoted to the same uses, can
                                be justified.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned has the honor to transmit herewith, with a request
                                for their ultimate return, certain documents enumerated below, all

                                subject of the alleged discrimination against American woods in the
                                freight tariff on railways in Germany under Government control, has

                                certain original papers, which are requested to be ultimately kindly
                                returned, which were sent to the United States State Department by
                                the Austro-American Stave and Lumber Company, of Shreveport, La.
                                Some of these papers have already been transmitted to the foreign
                                office, or referred to in former correspondence had by the embassy
                                on this subject, but it is now thought proper to submit them in

                                company mentioned has put before the United States Government.</p>

                                    to the decrease of the American timber import and to the
                                    petition of the stave consumers in Germany to the Prussian
                                    minister of public works to abolish the difference in the

                                    the Amtsgericht at Dortmund against the railway

                                <item>No. 11 is a letter from the lawyer, Dr. B. L. Oppenheimer, of
                                    Hamburg, to Mr. Max Grünhut, of the same place, containing
                                    advice as to further legal proceedings.</item>
                            </list>
                            <p>From these and other papers, already submitted, it seems clearly to
                                be shown that the opinions of experts and the decisions of the
                                courts of first instance agree in regard to the similarity in the
                                nature, and the uses to which they are applied, of American and
                                European oak, and in the opinion also that there is very little, if
                                any, difference in their value. The undersigned therefore ventures
                                to express the hope that, as by far the greater part of the railways
                                in Germany are under the control of the Government, and as the
                                determination of freight charges is to a great extent an
                                administrative act, it will be found possible to so interpret the
                                freight tariff in this connection that the causes for complaint may
                                soon be removed.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned avails himself, etc.,</p>

                            <p>Referring to the notes of the late ambassador of February 26 and
                                March 15 last, Nos. 186 and 197, in regard to the tariff levied on
                                American woods on German state railways, the undersigned has the
                                honor to inform his excellency the ambassador extraordinary and
                                plenipotentiary of the United States of America, Mr. Andrew D.
                                White, that the appropriate home officials, who were at the time
                                informed as to the contents of aforesaid notes and their inclosures,
                                do not find themselves in a position, after a renewed investigation
                                of the matter, to change the tariff rate in the manner desired by
                                the American interested parties. The same reasons have prevailed in
                                arriving at this decision which the undersigned had the honor to
                                place before Mr. Edwin F. Uhl in the note of January 22 last. The
                                larger number of the civil suits which were instituted by importers
                                of American woods against the several railway managements, to which
                                reference was made in the last notes of Mr. Edwin F. Uhl, have, thus
                                far, terminated in favor of the defendants.</p>
                            <p>In regard to the shipment of oak wood, which was said to be of
                                Galician origin, from Hamburg to Lennep, which was referred to, it
                                is true <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0280"/>that the firm in
                                question, C. Gartner, has won the first suit, but the Royal railway
                                management of Altona, fortified by the opinion of an expert, will
                                enter an appeal. That the wood came from Galicia would not of itself
                                prove that it belonged to that class of oak which is the subject of
                                cultivation for commercial purposes in Middle European forests, as
                                is required by the tariff. The possibility still exists that it was
                                oak of foreign origin, and, as the expert claims, of American
                                origin, which had been planted as an experiment in Galicia.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned, under these circumstances, renews the expression of
                                his regret that the request made can not be complied with. He also
                                permits himself, in order to prove the incorrectness of Mr. Edwin F.
                                Uhl’s presumption, that the application of the German railway
                                freight tariff discriminates against American woods, to call
                                attention to the fact that poplar wood of American origin, for
                                instance, is classified with the woods falling under Special Tariff
                                II, and that the freight is calculated in accordance therewith, for
                                the reason that American poplar wood is, according to expert
                                opinion, the same as the poplar wood which is a subject of
                                cultivation for commercial purposes in Middle European forests.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my dispatches Nos. 187 and
                            211, of November 12 and December 4 last, respectively, I have the honor
                            to inform you that the German Reichstag, on the 17th instant, adjourned
                            over the holidays until the 11th of January next, on which date the
                            Prussian Diet will assemble for its winter session.</p>
                        <p>As anticipated, the Government bills for increasing the navy and for the
                            reform in military judicial procedure, and the appropriation bills were
                            read once and referred to committees. Of action in regard to the army
                            and navy, I presume the military and naval attaches of this embassy will
                            keep our Departments fully informed.</p>
                        <p>As submitted by the Government, the estimated receipts and expenses for
                            the fiscal year 1898–99 balance at 1,437,179,979 marks, as against
                            1,328,301,824 marks for 1897–98, and among the proposed new expenses are
                            an increase of 18,000 marks in the amount (now 46,000 marks) allowed the
                            chancellor of the Empire for entertaining, etc., and additional 300,000
                            marks on account of participation in the exposition to be held in Paris
                            in 1900, 25,000 marks for continuing investigation as to the “foot and
                            mouth” disease in cattle, and 300,000 marks for a deep-sea expedition
                            which is to start from some German port in August next, and to
                            investigate the bottom of the sea to the depth of 1,000 meters between
                            Scotland and the Shetland Islands and then in the neighborhood of the
                            Canaries and Cape Verde. An increase is also recommended in the
                            personnel of the foreign office and of several missions and consulates,
                            and it is proposed to send a professional vice-consul (in <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0281"/>addition to the consul already there)
                            to Buenos Ayres, and to send out more professional officials than has
                            been the case heretofore where new consular offices are to be
                            established, to send a naval attaché for Eastern Asia, to reside in
                            Tokyo or Yokohama, and to send special agents to South Brazil, in
                            addition to the commissioners provided for in the emigration act
                            (dispatch of June 10, 1897), to inspect such land as may be opened for
                            settlement by German emigrants.</p>
                        <p>During the debate, which lasted for more than four days, duels in the
                            army, the treatment of the Poles in Prussia, the recent uproar in the
                            Austrian Parliament, the durability of the Triple Alliance and Italy’s
                            ability to perform her obligations under it, Haiti and China,
                            bimetallism, and sugar, were among the subjects referred to, and the new
                            American tariff came in for a good deal of abuse. Representatives of the
                            Government stated that the tariff negotiations between Germany and the
                            United States and England did not permit information in regard to them
                            to be communicated to the Parliament at present, and they explained the
                            nature of the work intended to be done by the “Zollbeirath” (dispatch
                            No. 180, November 8, 1897), calling attention to the fact that all
                            parties interested in tariff changes should take advantage of an early
                            opportunity to be heard before this committee, or the appropriate
                            subcommittee under it, in their own interest. The Radicals, as usual,
                            charged the Agrarian members with raising the prices of the people’s
                            food in their own selfish interests, and they received the customary
                            answer that the ever-wider extending prohibitions in regard to the
                            importation of pork and other farm products were necessary on sanitary
                            grounds. Baron Thielmann stated that the sugar-tax law of last year had
                            not produced the desired results, and that the negotiations which had
                            previously been of no effect (see dispatch No. 311, of July 24, 1895,
                            and note on “sugar bounties” in dispatch No. 469, of February 8, 1896),
                            looking to the abolishing of export premiums upon sugar by all of the
                            countries now paying such premiums, would probably soon be resumed, with
                            more prospect of success, in view of the conditions prevailing at
                            present.</p>
                        <p>Among the measures introduced by private members were the annual bill in
                            regard to the return of the Jesuits, amendments to the law of April 20,
                            1892, in regard to trade in wine, etc., amendments to the customs tariff
                            law of July 15, 1879, a bill looking to the introduction of
                            representative governments in all of the federal states (Mecklenburg has
                            as yet no parliament or legislature), a draft of a homestead law, a bill
                            for a tax on saccharine and other sweet stuffs, and an interpellation in
                            regard to trade in petroleum.</p>
                        <p>Of these the last was the only measure which came up for discussion. Its
                            text was: “What means do the Federated Governments think of taking in
                            order to counteract the efforts of the Standard Oil Company to
                            monopolize the trade in petroleum in Germany?” and it was supported by
                            members of the National Liberal and Conservative parties. In the
                            arguments in favor of the Government taking action, attention was called
                            to the fact that certain firms at Mannheim and elsewhere in Germany,
                            which had heretofore been considered as rivals of the Standard Oil
                            Company, had recently made terms with it, and the fear was expressed
                            that that company would now soon increase the price of petroleum. It was
                            urged that the Government should make all possible concessions in favor
                            of Russian petroleum, and the Agrarians, not unselfishly, advised the
                            Government to take vigorous action against the United States, to shut
                            out American petroleum and to thereby do something for agriculture by
                            promoting the use of illuminating <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0282"/>spirits. Count Possadowsky, the Imperial secretary of
                            the interior, said that he was obliged to admit that the price of
                            petroleum had gone down since the formation of the “Deutsche
                            Americanische Petroleum Gesellschaft” (Standard Oil Company) in Bremen,
                            but he was afraid that this had been the case in order that competitors
                            might be driven from the field, and that the price would at once go up
                            if competitors were removed. Consequently the Government had (since
                            1895) done all it could to favor “outsiders,” the importation of Russian
                            petroleum had been favored by allowing it to pay duty according to
                            volume instead of according to weight, and the Government would continue
                            to do all in its power to increase the consumption of Russian petroleum,
                            and to favor the “Pure Oil Company “in America. Count Possadowsky
                            further said that since the 5th of October last, a special railway
                            freight tariff (compare the embassy’s correspondence upon the subject of
                            American woods on German railways) had been in force giving low rates of
                            transportation for refined Russian petroleum shipped from Alexan-drowo
                            to German stations, and that still lower rates would soon be made, and
                            that an arrangement would soon be perfected by which a mixture of
                            American and Russian petroleum could be imported, upon which the duty
                            would be paid according to volume, and he added that he did not believe
                            that the American and Caucasian petroleum producers had been able to
                            make an arrangement in regard to a division of territory to be supplied,
                            although it was frequently reported that they had.</p>

                        <p>I inclose for your information and for the files of your embassy copies

                        <p>It is unnecessary to assure you of the President’s grateful appreciation
                            of your courteous action in the matter of his suggestion to send a
                            special embassy on so memorable an occasion. Your distinct telegraphic
                            statement of the 25th ultimo that Her Majesty would receive only one
                            special envoy from each country, coupled with your previous announcement
                            that you could be of more service in your present capacity, prevented
                            the President from including yourself in the special embassy. He doubts
                            not, however, that it will be your pleasure to cooperate with Mr. Reid
                            in all possible ways to insure harmony of action, and to promote the
                            delicate and important task intrusted to Mr. Reid. He has been
                            instructed to consult with you freely on all matters of detail, and thus
                            the matter is confidently left to the judgment of Mr. Reid and yourself,
                            since it is not possible at the present time to give him specific or
                            detailed instructions. He will take his departure probably to-morrow for

                                respecting restriction on the importation of spirits into Zanzibar,
                                that the draft ordinance having been again submitted to the acting
                                Imperial consul at Zanzibar for his opinion, the Imperial Government
                                no longer have any objections to offer to the issue of a decree in

                                wine, beer, and vermuth are not to be understood, and that the
                                period of six months provided by section 1 of the draft ordinance
                                shall only date from the publication of the decree in the official
                                newspaper which appears in Zanzibar. For <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0290"/>the rest, the Imperial Government proceed on the
                                assumption that those spirits which, being destined for
                                reexportation, lie sealed up at the custom-house, shall hereafter,
                                as formerly, be regulated by the provisions of Article VII, section
                                3, of the treaty of commerce and navigation between Germany and
                                Zanzibar.</p>
                            <p>The assent of the Imperial Government is subject to the reservation,
                                already stated in the note of April 10, of last year, that the other
                                power concerned shall also have concurred in the draft of the
                                decree, and that the compulsory execution of the provisions of the
                                decree against German subjects and protected persons by judicial or
                                administrative process shall only take place through the Imperial
                                consulate at Zanzibar, and in accordance with the legal provisions
                                which apply to the same.</p>

                                shall determine the limits of the zone of prohibition of alcoholic
                                liquors in its possessions or protectorates, and shall be bound to
                                notify the limits thereof to the other powers within the space of
                                six months, and also that the above prohibition can only be
                                suspended in the case of limited quantities destined for the
                                consumption of the nonnative population, and imported under the

                            <p>Whereas notice was given by Her Majesty’s Government to the several
                                powers signatory to the Brussels act by a circular dated London, the
                                6th April, 1892, that Her Majesty’s Government had decided that the
                                British protectorate of Zanzibar, including all the dominions of the
                                Sultan, both on the islands and on the mainland, should be placed
                                under the terms of Article XCI of the act of Brussels from that
                                date; and</p>
                            <p>Whereas by the same notice it was stated that Her Majesty’s agent and
                                consul-general had been directed to notify, in accordance with the
                                terms of Article XCI, the system and conditions determined by the
                                protecting power under which limited quantities might be imported
                                for the consumption of the nonnative population; and</p>
                            <p>Whereas it has been found necessary to impose further restrictions in
                                order to regulate the introduction and sale of the limited
                                quantities of alcoholic liquors which may be so introduced, it is
                                hereby enacted as follows:</p>
                            <p>1. From and after six months from this date no distilled or alcoholic
                                liquors shall be imported, whether by land or sea, into any of the
                                territories administered by or for His Highness the Sultan of
                                Zanzibar otherwise than in accordance with this ordinance.</p>
                            <p>2. For the use of the nonnative population only there shall be
                                admitted a limited quantity of distilled or alcoholic liquors
                                imported in bottles, packed in cases, and of a declared value,
                                supported by invoice or other documentary evidence as required, of
                                not less than 18 rupees per dozen reputed quarts, or 9 rupees per
                                dozen reputed pints, and so in proportion if bottles of other sizes
                                be used; or if imported in casks, of a declared value of not less
                                than 5 rupees per liquid gallon and bearing the brands of well-known
                                European producers of the higher kinds of spirituous liquors.</p>
                            <p>With each consignment the consignee shall give a written guaranty
                                that none of the liquor shall be sold to any native by him—that is
                                to say, any person born in Africa, not being of European race or
                                parentage—and no person, whether he is the possessor of a license or
                                not, shall sell any imported, distilled, or alcoholic liquor to any
                                native as herein defined.</p>
                            <p>Special exceptions may be made at the discretion of the first
                                minister, or director of customs acting on his behalf and under his
                                sanction, in favor of respectable natives of European colonies in
                                Africa in which the importation of spirituous liquors is
                                permitted.</p>

                            <p>3. Not more than 500 cases, containing 12 quarts or 24 pints in each
                                case, or in casks a total quantity not exceeding 1,000 gallons,
                                shall be withdrawn by any firm or individual in any one period of
                                six months, unless in virtue of a special permit granted by the
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>4. All liquors admitted shall be deposited in the custom-house, and
                                only be withdrawn as actually required, on application in writing
                                being made to the collector of customs. The casks and cases
                                containing them shall, before their withdrawal from the
                                custom-house, be stamped with the Government mark, “H. H. G.” They
                                will be stored free of rent for a period of six months. Duty will be
                                taken only when they are actually removed, save in the case of
                                liquors awaiting transshipment, which are free if shipped for their
                                original port of destination within six months of their arrival, and
                                in the interval have not changed owners.</p>
                            <p>5. No importer of, or trader in, such liquor shall be permitted to
                                withdraw more than twenty-four hours, and, on making an application
                                to do so, he shall, if so required, make a declaration stating that
                                he has not at that moment within his warehouses more than 100 cases
                                in addition to those which he wishes to withdraw.</p>
                            <p>6. Should any doubt arise as to the interpretation of any of the
                                above provisions, the question shall be submitted to a commission
                                consisting of three independent merchants nominated by Her Majesty’s

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: With reference to the Department’s
                            note of October 13 last, proposing the temporary postponement of the
                            correspondence concerning the regulation of pelagic sealing in Bering
                            Sea and the <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0293"/>North Pacific
                            Ocean, I have now the honor to observe that the suspension of the
                            discussion left two unsettled questions pending; first, as to permitting
                            seal skins landed at British ports to be examined by American inspectors
                            for the purpose of determining their sex and whether or not said skins
                            had been shot in violation of the Paris award and the British law; and,
                            second, the proposal for amending the regulations on the subject of the
                            use of firearms by pelagic sealers.</p>
                        <p>In reopening the subject I wish to say that the Department assumes that
                            Her Britannic Majesty’s Government, in suggesting that the certificates
                            of search and the sealing up of arms (see Lord Gough’s note of September
                            21, 1896) shall be accepted by patrolling officers as conclusive
                            evidence that no firearms are concealed on board, in effect proposes
                            that, under such circumstances, there shall be no search whatever of
                            such vessels. The Government of the United States does not think that
                            the arrangement ought to be made on that line. It considers a search
                            useful for two purposes; first, it discloses whether firearms or other
                            implements are on the vessel during any prohibited time in violation of
                            law, and, second, whether there are on board any seal skins, if in a
                            close season, and whether there are any skins which have been shot, if
                            the vessel has been engaged in sealing in Bering Sea where the use of
                            firearms is prohibited.</p>
                        <p>While the suggestion of Her Majesty’s Government, if adopted, might
                            properly be accepted as satisfactory evidence that there were no
                            firearms or implements forbidden to be used concealed on board the
                            vessel, there would still remain the second question, as to whether or
                            not in the close season there were on said vessel skins freshly killed,
                            or, if in Bering Sea, shot. As regards American vessels, this latter
                            question is settled by a careful inspection of each skin landed by an
                            expert inspector. This precaution, however, although adopted by the
                            United States upon the broad ground that it is absolutely essential for
                            preventing the unlawful destruction of fur seals, Her Majesty’s
                            Government refuses to adopt and declines to afford the United States an
                            opportunity to make this inspection for itself by its duly appointed
                            inspectors.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances it will readily appear that if the United States
                            were to accept the suggestion of Mer Majesty’s Government above referred
                            to it would result in discrimination against American vessels in favor
                            of those of Great Britain. At this time the mere fact of the sealing up
                            of arms does not protect American vessels from being searched; on the
                            contrary, they have been searched as thoroughly and as rigidly as have
                            the British vessels. The sealing up of arms is merely a part of the
                            evidence from which the boarding officer knows that said arms could not
                            have been used in killing seals. To accept the suggestion of Her
                            Majesty’s Government and cease to search British vessels, especially in
                            consideration of the fact above stated, that United States vessels are
                            rigidly searched, and that no examinations of skins are made at British
                            ports, would be to discriminate doubly against American vessels.</p>
                        <p>It is believed by this Government to be practicable to discover by an
                            examination of skins landed whether the seals have been shot or speared;
                            also as to their sex, except in the case of pups. This method, I may
                            observe, has been in practice for the past two years by the Government
                            of the United States with most satisfactory results, and I take pleasure
                            in transmitting herewith for the information of Her Majesty’s Government
                            copies of a Treasury circular, No. 75, dated April 12, 1895, giving full
                            instructions respecting the pelagic catch of fur seals.</p>
                        <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0294"/>
                        <p>The sole object of the proposals heretofore made by this Government
                            concerning these subjects was to prevent the unlawful destruction of the
                            fur seals, an object clearly within the purview of the Paris award, and
                            which seems plainly indispensable under existing circumstances to the
                            proper execution of the respective laws enacted by the United States and
                            Great Britain to carry that award into effect. Nor am I able to perceive
                            that the proposed regulations would interfere with any lawful business
                            carried on by Her Majesty’s subjects.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the time is nearly at hand when the regulations
                            for the season of 1897 should be agreed upon, it is hoped that Her
                            Majesty’s Government will find it convenient to give the subject early
                            attention, and to afford this Department the benefit of any suggestions
                            it may have to present.</p>

                            of the 15th ultimo, concerning the regulation of pelagic sealing in
                            Bering Sea and the North Pacific Ocean, and particularly as to the
                            unsettled questions relative to the inspection of skins and the use of

                            the 10th instant, stating that the former regulation can not be made
                            compulsory without legislation by the Canadian Parliament, and that
                            until the views of the Canadian Government have been received, that of
                            Her Majesty can not go beyond the offer made in Viscount Gough’s note to

                            of the near approach of the sealing season, to be informed as to when
                            the Canadian Government will probably be prepared to take action in

                            stating that the proposed regulations in so far as the same relate to

                            by the Canadian Parliament, I have the honor, in view of the near
                            approach of the opening of the sealing season, to recall your attention
                            to Mr. Olney’s note of January 23 last, asking to be informed of the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to an inquiry made by your
                            predecessor on January 4 last, respecting the report of Prof. D’Arcy W.
                            Thompson, British commissioner in charge of the fur-seal investigations
                            for 1896, I have the honor to inform you, by the direction of the
                            Marquis of Salisbury, that no formal record of proceedings has yet been
                            received from Professor Thompson, but that Her Majesty’s Government will
                            be happy to furnish the United States Government with a copy of his
                            definite report, which is in a forward state of preparation, as soon as
                            it has been printed.</p>
                        <p>From such information as has hitherto been furnished by Professor
                            Thompson, and the facts as to the present condition of the seal herd set
                            forth in Dr. Jordan’s report, there is apparently no reason to fear that
                            the seal herd is threatened with early extermination.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s Government, however, believe that some modification of the
                            sealing regulations will be required at the expiration of the five
                            years’ term which was named by the Arbitration Tribunal of 1893. That
                            period expires at the close of the season of 1898, and it would be
                            desirable that the discussion of the modifications which may be found
                            necessary should take place in the course of that year, in order that
                            the revised regulations may be ready for adoption before the sealing
                            season of 1899. And with this object in view, Her Majesty’s Government
                                <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0296"/>are very desirous of
                            sending out special agents again in June next to carry on further
                            inquiries and observations in the Pribilof Islands.</p>
                        <p>Professor Thompson has stated to Her Majesty’s Government his views as to
                            the various points in regard to seal life, which require further
                            investigation to enable Her Majesty’s Government to consider the
                            question of revising the regulations.</p>
                        <p>The statistics of former observers were found to afford no evidence on
                            which an accurate estimate of the diminution in the number of seals
                            could be based, but the careful count of the seals which was made last
                            summer forms a valuable standard for comparison. It is very essential to
                            ascertain as far as possible what has been the result of last season’s
                            operations on land and at sea, and also to obtain the latest information
                            as to the number of seals frequenting the islands.</p>
                        <p>The result of the joint investigations showed that no great difficulty
                            was found in taking 30,000 seals on land in 1896; and whatever number it
                            may be decided to kill this year, it is important to observe with what
                            degree of facility the total is reached.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons Professor Thompson is anxious that British agents
                            should again be appointed with the same powers and the same freedom of
                            action as they enjoyed last year.</p>
                        <p>In communicating the above I am directed by my Government to express the
                            hope that the facilities and accommodations which were last year
                            provided for the British agents may be likewise afforded on this
                            occasion.</p>
                        <p>I may add that agents will be sent to the Commander and Robben islands,
                            and that an application has been made to the Russian Government on this
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>I am informed by telegraph by the Marquis of Salisbury that Professor
                            Thompson is desirous of starting on April 8 via Japan, and to visit the
                            Russian islands in the first instance.</p>
                        <p>In view of the very short time which remains, I venture to ask you to be
                            good enough to favor me with a reply to this note at your earliest
                            convenience in order that I may be able to report by telegraph to Lord
                            Salisbury whether the United States Government are willing to afford the
                            facilities to which I have above alluded to the British agents.</p>

                        <p>The President is greatly concerned as to the present depleted condition
                            and the prospective early extinction of the Alaskan seal herd. In the
                            midst of the cares attending organization of his Administration the
                            subject has forced itself on his attention, and he is convinced that it
                            is indispensable that immediate steps be taken to stop indiscriminate
                            slaughter through pelagic sealing.</p>
                        <p>This is result of Jordan’s investigation and believed confirmed by
                            Thompson. You are instructed to bring subject to immediate attention of
                            British Government, communicate President’s concern and urgent
                            expectation that effective measures be at once adopted by the respective
                            Governments. He deems it requisite that a modus vivendi should be agreed
                            upon with equitable provision for interests involved suspending all
                            killing for the season ’97 in Bering Sea, taking modus of ’91 as basis.
                            This is to be accompanied by an arrangement for a joint conference at an
                            early day of Powers concerned to agree upon measures necessary to
                            preserve the seals of the North Pacific from extermination and to
                            restore them to their normal conditions for insuring continued
                            existence. It will not satisfy the President to be informed that the
                            British Government proposes to take up the subject at the close of next
                            year’s season, as contemplated in the Paris award. If destruction goes
                            on meanwhile, there will be no occasion for conference then. Action as
                            indicated must be taken now if herd is to be saved. If modus agreed to,
                            full liberty will be given Professor Thompson and assistants to visit
                            islands. You will urge an early answer to proposal, <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0298"/>as President desires to know whether he
                            can rely upon friendly cooperation with Great Britain. In case of
                            refusal, he must early consider what measures independent of that
                            Government he shall adopt</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that you communicate to Russian ambassador purport of
                            this instruction, with a view to securing his cooperation on assurance
                            that modus should, in opinion of President, include waters of Russian
                            islands and conference embrace his Government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: Circumstances beyond my control
                            have delayed an answer up to this time of the note which you did me the
                            honor to address me under date of the 23d ultimo, wherein you advise me
                            of the desire of your Government that Professor Thompson should revisit
                            the seal islands in Bering Sea, and that the same facilities and
                            accommodations which were last year provided for the British agents may
                            be afforded on the comtemplated visit.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States has always cheerfully welcomed the
                            visit to the Pribilof Islands of duly authorized British agents who were
                            desirous of making an impartial and scientific study of the seal herd
                            which has its home on those islands, and if your note had been confined
                            to this request, it would have received the prompt and favorable reply
                            for which you expressed a desire. But it contained statements of fact
                            and conclusions reached by Her Majesty’s Government of such a serious
                            character that I felt it my duty to lay the note before the President
                            for his consideration and instructions. Notwithstanding the many and
                            absorbing questions which demand his time in the inauguration of his
                            Administration, he has given to the subjects suggested by your note the
                            preferential attention which their importance demanded, and though he
                            has as promptly as possible devoted his time to the examination and
                            consideration of the facts and correspondence, I have not until the
                            present been able to make the response to your note which a due regard
                            for its tenor required.</p>
                        <p>The President instructs me to say that he is greatly concerned as to the
                            present depleted condition and the prospective early extinction of the
                            Alaskan seal herd. He can not agree with your note as to the conclusions
                            reached by Dr. Jordan in his report. Unfortunately for the Government of
                            the United States, it does not have the information contained in
                            Professor Thompson’s report possessed by Lord Salisbury. Feeling that
                            the result of the investigation made in 1896 by the scientists of the
                            two Governments should be respectively made known to each other at the
                            earliest practicable date, my predecessor caused Dr. Jordan’s report to
                            be promptly prepared, and copies of it have been in the hands of the
                            British Government for some time past. It is much regretted that a
                            similar course was not pursued as to the report of Professor Thompson,
                            and peculiarly unfortunate that another season of pelagic sealing should
                            be entered upon without any opportunity on the part of my Government to
                            examine that report.</p>
                        <p>The President is therefore forced to reach his conclusion on the points
                            treated of in your note by a careful study of Dr. Jordan’s report and
                                <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0299"/>other ascertained facts and
                            statistics. Dr. Jordan’s report shows conclusively that there has been a
                            distinct and steady decrease both in the total number of breeding seals
                            and in the number of breeding cows in the season of 1896 as compared
                            with that of 1895. It further appears from said report conclusively that
                            this diminution has been caused by pelagic sealing, the most destructive
                            effects of which are manifested in Bering Sea in August, at which time
                            at least two-thirds of the catch consists of females, who are then
                            leaving the islands for food for their pups. It is further shown that
                            the number of pups thus dying from starvation, their mothers having been
                            killed at sea, amounts, for the season of 1896, to 14,473. It is further
                            apparent from said report that it was as easy in 1880 to procure on land
                            100,000 skins of the same quality as those taken during the season of
                            1896 as it was to obtain the catch of last year, namely, 30,000. The
                            number of breeding females is not over one-fourth as many now as in
                            1880. These facts lead Dr. Jordan to the positive conclusion that
                            pelegic sealing will ultimately result in the practical extinction of
                            the herd.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the statistics of the catch in Bering Sea, it appears that 37
                            vessels in 1894 killed 31,585 seals, while in 1896, 67 vessels only
                            secured 29,500. The average catch per vessel in Bering Sea in 1894 was
                            853 as compared with 440 in 1896. It may be claimed that the land catch
                            increased in 1896, as compared with 1895, from 15,000 to 30,000, and
                            that this may have had some influence upon the decrease of the pelagic
                            catch of 14,669 in 1896 as compared with 1895. It should be remembered,
                            however, that the average percentage of females to males in the Bering
                            Sea catches of both British and American vessels was about two-thirds
                            females to one-third males. At the utmost, therefore, the increased
                            catch on the islands would have affected the pelagic catch a little more
                            than 4,000 skins leaving a decrease of at least 10,000 unaccounted for
                            except by a falling off in the female seals. It should further be
                            remembered that the catch on the islands was increased in 1896 to
                            30,000, because it was plain, upon scientific investigation, that the
                            dangerous mortality among female seals brought about by pelagic sealing
                            has left the number of bulls greatly in excess of the due proportion
                            between the sexes, and to properly care for the herd it became necessary
                            to remove, as far as possible, this menacing excess of male life upon
                            the islands.</p>
                        <p>The further startling fact appears that in Bering Sea the total catch
                            decreased from 44.169 in 1895 to 29,500 in 1896, a decrease of 33 per
                            cent in the herd’s capacity to yield a pelagic catch, and if allowance
                            is made for the seals which the pelagic sealer was prevented from taking
                            by the increased land killing of 1896, the percentage of decrease in the
                            capacity of the herd for such a yield is still found to be about 25 per
                            cent in one year. When it is further considered that the present number
                            of breeding seals (a little over 143,000 in 1896) is but little more
                            than one-half of the number (280,000) computed to be on said islands in
                            1890, it must become evident that before arrangements can be concluded
                            for the new regulations for the season of 1899 there is grave reason to
                            fear that the herd will have reached a stage so low that recuperation
                            can be secured only with great difficulty, if at all.</p>
                        <p>From the foregoing and other facts which might be cited, the President is
                            forced to express his strong dissent from the conclusions which seem
                            from your note to have been reached by Her Majesty’s Government, that
                            there is no such imminent danger of the early extermination of the seal
                            herd as to call for any action by the two Governments <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0300"/>before the close of the season of 1898.
                            On the contrary, he feels that if the destruction goes oh meanwhile
                            there will be little occasion for action then, as the herd will be so
                            far reduced as to render its further protection fruitless. The
                            expression “no reason to fear that the seal herd is threatened with
                            early extermination” is noted with surprise. Is it the intention of the
                            British Government to delay action until the verge of extinction is
                            reached? Does that course commend itself to its sense of justice and
                            humanity? Is it right that the great interests of a friendly power and
                            the existence of a useful race of animals should be exposed by the
                            continual practice of a means of slaughter which it is conceded will
                            ultimately result to their destruction?</p>
                        <p>The Paris Tribunal reached the conclusion, upon the facts before it, that
                            a certain amount of pelagic sealing could be carried on without serious
                            danger to the continued existence of the herd, and upon this conviction
                            it authorized the practice of pelagic sealing under certain restrictions
                            as to time and methods. But the experience of the past years since the
                            decision at Paris has shown that the conclusion there reached is not
                            sustained by the facts, and that pelagic sealing, if persisted in, will
                            sooner or later result in practical extermination. Such being the
                            ascertained fact, it seems to the President just and right that the
                            practice authorized by the tribunal under a fallacious conclusion should
                            be abandoned or modified in such a way as to accomplish the declared
                            purpose of the Paris arbitration—the continued existence and
                            preservation of the herd.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing conclusions, the President has directed me to
                            communicate by cable to the embassy in London his desire that the
                            subject be brought at once to the attention of Lord Salisbury, with his
                            urgent request that a modus vivendi should be agreed upon, with
                            equitable provision for the interests involved, suspending all killing
                            for the season of 1897, and that this should be accompanied by an
                            arrangement for a joint conference at an early day, of the powers
                            concerned, to agree upon measures necessary to preserve the seals of the
                            North Pacific Ocean from extermination and to restore them to their
                            normal condition for insuring continued existence. Our representative in
                            London was instructed to urge an early answer to the proposal, as the
                            President desired to know whether he could rely upon the friendly
                            cooperation of Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>In communicating to you, Mr. Ambassador, the foregoing action of the
                            President, I invoke your good offices with your Government at London to
                            secure from it such favorable action as will tend to cement our
                            relations of cordial cooperation and friendship.</p>

                            translation of a telegram which I received from you on the 9th instant,
                            relative to the Alaskan seal question, and of the reply which I sent you
                            yesterday.</p>
                        <p>I also inclose a copy of a note which I thereupon addressed to Her
                            Majesty’s Government, and which I handed at the foreign office, in the
                            absence on the Continent of the Marquis of Salisbury, to the Hon.
                            Francis Villiers, the assistant under secretary, who has charge of the
                            American department.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Villiers at once read the note, but was not in a position, of course,
                            to make any reply to the proposal therein made. He said, however, that
                            it should receive the prompt attention of Her Majesty’s Government. I
                            have since received a note from him to the same effect, of which I
                            inclose a copy herewith, together with two telegrams from the American
                            correspondent of the Times, and a leading article from that newspaper on
                            the subject.</p>
                        <p>I had previously seen the Russian ambassador, to whom I communicated the
                            views of the President and yourself relative to the seal question. His
                            excellency said that the matter is one in which his Government takes
                            much interest, and he promised to telegraph at once on the subject to
                            St. Petersburg.</p>
                        <p>I shall lose no time in communicating to you by telegraph the substance

                                lordship that as a result of the investigations made last year in
                                Alaskan waters by Dr. Jordan, with whose views Professor Thompson,
                                who was sent by Her Majesty’s Government to make similar
                                investigations, is believed to concur, the present state of the
                                Alaskan seals has forced itself, in the midst of the many cares
                                attending the organization of his Administration, upon the attention
                                of the President of the United States, to whom the depleted
                                condition and prospective early extinction of the herd are a matter
                                of grave concern.</p>
                            <p>I have received urgent telegraphic instructions, therefore, to bring
                                the subject to the immediate attention of Her Majesty’s Government,
                                and to communicate the President’s earnest hope and expectation that
                                effective measures may at once be adopted by the respective
                                Governments with a view to putting a stop to the indiscriminate
                                slaughter of the seals through pelagic sealing.</p>
                            <p>I am instructed to suggest to Her Majesty’s Government that, in the
                                opinion of the President, a modus vivendi based upon that of 1891,
                                with equitable provision for the various interests involved,
                                suspending all killing of seals during the season of 1897 in Bering
                                Sea, should <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0302"/>be agreed upon
                                without delay, and that this should be accompanied by an arrangement
                                for a joint conference, at an early day, of the Powers concerned,
                                for the purpose of agreeing upon the measures necessary for the
                                preservation of the seals in the North Pacific from extermination
                                and of restoring them to their normal condition, with a view to
                                their continued existence.</p>
                            <p>To defer taking up the subject until after the termination of the
                                season of 1898, as contemplated by the award of the Tribunal of
                                Arbitration at Paris, would, in the opinion of my Government, be
                                fatal to the object in view, as, should the destruction continue
                                during two more seasons, there will be no occasion, owing to the
                                disappearance of the seals, for a conference.</p>
                            <p>The President sees, therefore, no escape from the conviction that
                                there is urgent necessity for prompt action, such as I now have the
                                honor to propose in his behalf, and in so doing I am instructed to
                                say that if Her Majesty’s Government should see their way to
                                agreeing to the modus vivendi herein suggested my Government will
                                have pleasure in giving full opportunity to Professor Thompson and
                                his assistants to visit the seal islands in accordance with the
                                request to that effect which has been made by the British ambassador
                                at Washington.</p>
                            <p>In view of the approach of the sealing season and of the consequent
                                importance that the President should be in a position to know as

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your instruction numbered
                            1479, of the 9th instant, which reached this embassy to-day, and to your
                            cablegram of yesterday’s date, of which I inclose a copy, I have the
                            honor to transmit herewith an advance copy of Prof. D’Arcy Thompson’s
                            report on his mission to the Bering Sea in 1896, which I have just
                            succeeded in obtaining at the foreign office at 2 o’clock, and which I
                            hasten to send off by the dispatch bag, leaving in a few minutes.</p>
                        <p>It is dated March 4 last, but the inclosed copy is, I understand, the
                            first which has been completed, and it was brought to me while I waited
                            at the foreign office.</p>
                        <p>While there I ascertained from the under secretary that my note on this
                            subject of the 10th instant had been sent to the Marquis of Salisbury,
                            who is still in the south of France, by the first available messenger,
                            after I left it at the foreign office, but that, up to the present
                            moment, no communication has been received from his lordship in
                            reference thereto.</p>
                        <p>I was further informed that a telegram had been received from the British
                            ambassador at Washington, stating that you had assented, in behalf of
                            our Government, to the request of Her Majesty’s Government that Prof.
                            D’Arcy Thompson and others should again visit the Pribilof Islands this
                            summer for the purpose of carrying on further investigations relative to
                            the seal herd. It is apparently understood by the ambassador, and
                            certainly by the foreign office, that this assent is not conditional
                            upon that of Her Majesty’s Government to our proposal for a modus
                            vivendi. * * *</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I transmit to your excellency herewith a
                            copy of a note from the United States chargé d’affaires, stating that he
                            has received instructions to bring the question of the fur-seal fishery
                            in the North Pacific to the immediate attention of Her Majesty’s
                            Government, and to express the earnest hope of the President that
                            effective measures may be at once taken by the respective Governments in
                            order to put a stop to the indiscriminate slaughter of the seals through
                            pelagic sealing.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that a “modus vivendi” similar to that of 1891 should be
                            agreed to, to be followed by a joint conference of the powers concerned,
                            with a view to the necessary measures being adopted for the preservation
                            of the seals in the North Pacific.</p>
                        <p>It is further stated, in the event of Her Majesty’s Government concurring
                            in these proposals, full opportunity will be given to Prof. d’Arcy
                            Thompson to visit the seal islands in accordance with the request which
                            was made to the United States Government through your excellency.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s Government were convinced that the United States Government
                            did not intend to refuse all further opportunity for investigation
                            unless these proposals were accepted, and I have accordingly been glad
                            to receive your excellency’s telegram No. 42 of the 14th instant,
                            stating that the requisite facilities will be accorded to Professor
                            Thompson to enable him to visit the islands again this season, and that
                            Dr. Jordan will, it is hoped, join him in his tour.</p>
                        <p>The above urgent application is reported to be based on the result of Dr.
                            Jordan’s investigations last year, in which it is stated Professor
                            Thompson is believed to concur.</p>
                        <p>I am now able to inclose, for communication to the United States
                            Government, copies of Mr. Thompson’s report, from which it will be seen
                            that the President is mistaken in supposing that in the opinion of the
                            British agent there is any immediate cause for alarm. Dr. Jordan’s
                            report, moreover, has been carefully examined and does not appear to
                            contain any facts which would warrant the statement made in Mr. White’s
                            note as to the “depleted condition and prospective early extinction of
                            the herd.” On the contrary, both reports are generally to the effect
                            that the number of seals in 1896 show no evidence of any measurable
                            diminution as compared with 1895, and that no immediate danger is to be
                            apprehended to the herd, which appears to be in a much better condition
                            than was reported in 1894 and 1895.</p>
                        <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0305"/>
                        <p>For instance, in commenting on the statistics of 1895–96 for St. George
                            Island, Mr. Thompson states, at page 7 of his report, that although the
                            figures may not afford any positive evidence of an actual increase of
                            the herd between the seasons of 1895 and 1896, on the other hand it is
                            abundantly clear that there is no evidence at all to show a decrease
                            during that period, and that the state of the herd on the island is at
                            least very much better than it was believed to be from the reports of
                            the American agents in 1896. He further observes (page 17) that had the
                            decrease in the rookeries been as great and evident as it was reported
                            to be up to 1895 the next twelve months would surely have shown signs
                            still more unequivocal of continued impoverishment of the stock.</p>
                        <p>The photographs, however, show, with very few exceptions, an identical
                            record. The harems were counted in both years by the same agents, and
                            all the rookeries but one show a large increase in the latter year.</p>
                        <p>Owing to the stormy weather prevailing during last sealing season the
                            pelagic catch was much reduced, the catch in Bering Sea having only been
                            about two-thirds of that of 1895. The low prices, moreover, realized for
                            last year’s skins are likely to lead to a smaller number of vessels
                            fitting out for the fishery this season, and there is therefore no
                            information before Her Majesty’s Government to warrant the belief of the
                            United States Government that to defer taking up the subject until after
                            the season of 1898 would be fatal to the preservation of the I herd.</p>
                        <p>I Similar statements as to the immediate disappearance of the herd have
                            been made in previous years, but experience has shown that the fears
                            then expressed were groundless, and Her Majesty’s Government are
                            convinced that they will prove to be equally so on the present
                            occasion.</p>
                        <p>The small catch and low prices obtained for the skins last year brought
                            many of the owners of the sealing vessels to the verge of. bankruptcy,
                            and were Her Majesty’s Government to prohibit pelagic sealing altogether
                            for this year it would mean the probable ruin of a considerable number
                            of British subjects engaged in a lawful industry. Of course, if the
                            United States Government are prepared to give adequate compensation to
                            the sealing fleet on account of its enforced abstention from the fishery
                            this season, Her Majesty’s Government would have no reason for refusing
                            their assent to the proposal for a “modus vivendi,” but they do not
                            gather that such is the case, and it would be impossible for them to
                            submit a note to Parliament for the purpose, holding, as they do, that
                            no sufficient reason has been shown for its necessity.</p>
                        <p>As regards the proposed conference, Her Majesty’s Government are of
                            opinion that further investigation is necessary on many points connected
                            with seal life before the questions at issue could be discussed with the
                            hope of attaining any satisfactory result.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Jordan and Professor Thompson are agreed that it is most important
                            that an accurate count of seals on the principal rookeries should be
                            made during several seasons, in order to ascertain the changes from year

                            conclusion of Mr. Thompson’s report, on which, pending further inquiry,
                            he finds it desirable to suspend judgment.</p>
                        <p>It is admitted that the investigation carried out last year afforded for
                            the first time any really reliable statistics in regard to the condition
                            of the herd, and that all previous reports received on the subject are
                            practically valueless for purposes of comparison.</p>

                        <p>To estimate accurately the effect on the herd of the various agencies now
                            at work, reliable statistics extending over a sufficient period to
                            enable accidental circumstances to be eliminated should be available,
                            and Her Majesty’s Government must adhere to the view set forth iu my
                            dispatch, No. 42, of the 6th ultimo—that further investigation is
                            required before the question of revising the regulations can be
                            considered.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that I have
                            received your cipher telegram, dated the 24th, on Sunday, the 25th, a
                            copy of which I inclose.</p>
                        <p>To-day, at the earliest hour possible, I went to the foreign office and
                            asked for an audience with Sir Thomas Sanderson, the permanent under
                            secretary who, in the absence of Lord Salisbury on the Continent, is in
                            charge of foreign affairs. I expressed to him the earnest desire of the
                            President for an immediate and, if possible, a favorable reply to your
                            suggestion of a new modus vivendi for the suppression of pelagic sealing
                            for this season, and for a conference of the Powers interested for the
                            purpose of adopting some definite plan for the preservation of the seal
                            herd now threatened with extinction. I went over some of the
                            considerations embraced in your instruction showing the rapid decrease
                            in breeding seals and the necessity for prompt action to prevent the
                            total extinction of the species. I said the interests of England and the
                            United States were identical in the matter; that the business of sealing
                            would be lost to the Canadians by the extinction of the seals, as well
                            as the handling of the product in London. I mentioned the 1st of May as
                            the date of sailing of the patrol fleet and of the departure of the
                            sealing vessels, and explained the urgency of the President in
                            requesting immediate light upon the intentions of the British
                            Government, so that if they should unfortunately conclude to decline the
                            suggestion of the President for a modus vivendi he might be free to take
                            such other measures for the protection of the seals as the exigencies of
                            the case might seem to require.</p>
                        <p>Sir Thomas Sanderson said the information in the possession of the
                            British Government led them to a conclusion altogether different; that
                                <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0307"/>while there might be a
                            certain diminution in the numbers of the herd, there was no danger of
                            entire extermination; that the number of sealing vessels was
                            considerably diminished from that of last year; that with the diminution
                            of the seals pelagic sealing would doubtless become less profitable and
                            would gradually be given up, and that those engaged in the land-killing
                            of seals would then have control of the business. He said that the fact
                            of the sealers starting about the 1st of May was less important in view
                            of the fact that they went first to the coast of Japan and could be
                            communicated with, if necessary, later on.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the mention of the reports from the British commissioners, I
                            said that the conclusion of Mr. Thompson did not seem in entire
                            accordance with the facts on which they were based. His statistics
                            showed great mortality among the young seals, which apparently was
                            caused by starvation.</p>
                        <p>In reply to my repeated solicitations for an early answer he said Lord
                            Salisbury would not arrive until about the 1st of May; that the matter
                            could not be fully brought before him until his arrival; but he proposed
                            to consult with the colonial secretary, Mr. Chamberlain, and with Mr.
                            Bertie, who had been paying especial attention to the matter. He
                            regretted the absence of Mr. Villiers, who was particularly informed as
                            to this subject, but who was away on a week’s vacation.</p>
                        <p>Sir Thomas Sanderson then took me to see Mr. Bertie, who at the outset of
                            our conversation mentioned the subject of compensation to interests
                            involved in pelagic sealing. I told him that the President proposed that
                            any modus vivendi adopted should contain equitable provision for
                            legitimate interests involved. He said it was not probable that the
                            Government of Her Majesty would be inclined to make any change in the
                            present regulations; that they did not believe the seals were in any
                            danger of extermination; that an instruction had been sent to Sir Julian
                            Pauncefote last Friday, which ought to be in Washington the last of this
                            week. In reply to my inquiry as to the drift of this instruction, he
                            said it could not be communicated until confirmed by Lord Salisbury, but
                            that the substance of it was that the British Government saw no reason
                            to make any change in the existing regulations. He repeated the belief
                            of the Government that there was no danger of the extinction of the
                            seals. I told him that the opinion of the President, derived from a
                            careful study of the subject, was exactly the contrary.</p>
                        <p>Returning from the foreign office, I sent you the telegram, a copy of
                            which I inclose.</p>

                            16th instant, stating that orders would be issued to the authorities on
                            the Pribilof Islands to extend to Professor Thompson the same facilities
                            as were granted to him during his visit last year.</p>
                        <p>I am now informed by Lord Salisbury that it is proposed that Mr. Macoun,

                        <p>I venture, therefore, to ask you to be good enough to extend to Mr.

                            investigations prior to Professor Thompson’s arrival on the islands.</p>
                        <p>Lord Salisbury further informs me that Professor Thompson proposes to
                            visit the Russian islands first. He hopes to reach Yokohama on about the

                            <p>For fully two years before our Government decided to dispatch a party
                                of naturalists to the Bering Sea to investigate, from the British
                                point of view, the latest phase of the sealing question, complaints
                                had been made by both the United States and Russia that the
                                operations Of the pelagic hunters were leading to the extermination
                                of the animals from all the breeding grounds on the Pribilof and
                                Command-der islands. It can not be said, therefore, that we, who
                                have a large stake in this pelagic branch of the sealing industry,
                                have moved with undue precipitation in the investigation of what is
                                a very important matter. Lord Salisbury might have chosen, and he
                                may yet choose, if the commissioners so advise, to stand by the
                                terms of the Paris award of 1893, when it was agreed that the
                                regulations passed “for the proper protection and preservation of
                                the fur seal in or habitually resorting to” the Bering Sea should be
                                submitted every five years to a new examination. But this
                                arrangement does not, of course, preclude an earlier reopening of
                                the question if the parties concerned agree upon the necessity of
                                such a step; and if it be true (and there can be little doubt that
                                it is true) that the animals are diminishing in numbers at an
                                alarming rate, it would be an obvious piece of folly on the part of
                                Great Britain, which alone stands in the way, to insist upon the
                                observance of the letter of the award and wait until there are no
                                seals before taking action.</p>
                            <p>All that is wanting now before we decide upon some course is the
                                report of the Commissioners, which should have been out long ago.
                                Failing any mutually satisfactory basis of agreement, there is
                                reason to fear that the extreme party in America, which country, be
                                it noted, has never been at the pains to conceal its dissatisfaction
                                with the award for reasons which are essentially selfish, may have
                                its way, and that a bill may be passed to empower the Secretary of
                                the Treasury to slaughter every fur seal found on the Pribilof
                                Islands (which are the American islands) and to sell the skins to
                                the best advantage for the benefit of the Treasury at Washington.
                                This proposal to kill the goose that lays the golden egg in a fit of
                                pique does not commend itself as reasonable; but it is significant
                                that the Secretary of the Treasury last year gave the lessors of the
                                fishery, the North American Commercial Company, permission to take
                                twice as many male skins during the season as they were allowed to
                                take the previous year; his reason being that the seals after
                                leaving the rookeries are killed in any case. If the matter is not
                                settled early, we are threatened with another jingo outburst against
                                England. We will no doubt survive it, but for the protection of our
                                own interests it seems desirable that a modus vivendi should not be
                                put off any longer. Mr. Smalley tells us that Professor Thompson’s
                                report will “contain facts showing that much damage is caused by
                                pelagic sealing and the indiscriminate killing of females.” In that
                                case something must be done at once.</p>
                            <p>That the seals are diminishing in numbers and that they have gone on
                                diminishing in spite of the Paris regulations are facts which
                                unfortunately admit of little question in spite of Sir Charles
                                Tupper’s airy denial. Less than ten years ago an approximate
                                estimate of the animals found on the islands of St. Paul and St.
                                George—that is the two islands of the Pribilof group frequented by
                                the seals—gave a total of 3,000,000. Certainly the rookeries and the
                                hauling grounds were packed so closely that there was literally not
                                room enough for all the seals to live comfortably. A careful count
                                made two years ago resulted in the enumeration of a little over
                                200,000. Under the terms of the original lease the company in
                                possession of the islands was permitted to kill 100,000 bachelor
                                males every season, and high as that limit appears it was really
                                small by comparison with the number of the whole herd. Down to the
                                time when pelagic sealing began to be prosecuted in the Bering Sea,
                                as well as in the open waters of the North Pacific, there was, by
                                the admission of Sir George Baden-Powell himself, little apparent
                                falling off. In 1890, the last year of the old lease, the Alaska
                                Commercial Company found it impossible to take the number of
                                bachelors or “see-katchies” permitted by law, simply because there
                                were not 100,000 to take. Under the new lease to the North American
                                Commercial Company it was stipulated that the Secretary of the
                                Treasury should fix the annual catch at his discretion. In 1895 Mr.
                                Carlisle found it necessary to restrict the land catch to 15,000
                                male skins. In that same year the vessels engaged in the pelagic
                                branch of the industry numbered 97, of which 81 were employed in the
                                award area. Between them they killed and recovered 56,291 seals, or
                                a decrease, as compared with the corrected <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0310"/>figures of 1894, of 5,547. That
                                this decrease was caused by the falling off in the spring catch
                                along the shores of the United States and British Columbia will be
                                obvious when we state that the catch in the Bering-Sea alone after
                                the close season was 44,169; or 12,584 more than in 1894. All this
                                is quite independent of the Asiatic catch, which did not exceed
                                39,003 skins, as compared with 79,305 skins taken in those
                                waters—that is, off the Japanese and Russian coasts—in the previous
                                season.</p>
                            <p>The Paris regulations, it may be remembered, established a close
                                season during the months of May, June, and July, and (among other
                                things) made it illegal to use firearms or explosives in the Bering
                                Sea, or to “kill, capture, or pursue” the seal within a radius of 60
                                miles of the Pribilof Islands. The American Government has all along
                                maintained that these regulations would fail to protect the herd
                                from undue destruction. But the contention that the only remedy was
                                the total prohibition of pelagic fishing north of latitude 35<hi rend="superscript">C</hi> was not reasonable; for, apart from
                                the monopoly that the Americans would thereby have gained, there was
                                no adequate ground for depriving the men engaged in this important
                                branch of the trade of their regular occupation. It has become
                                apparent, however, that the regulations were not sufficiently
                                stringent. During the winter months the seals take their long swims
                                into the Pacific. The Russian herd, which breeds on the Commander
                                Islands, heads past the Kurile Islands for the Japanese coast, and
                                in the sparing returns by the way it went. The American herd makes
                                right across from the Aleutian Islands to the British Columbian
                                waters and returns along the shores of Alaska, entering the Bering
                                Sea again by way of Unalaska. The pelagic sealers and the Alaskan
                                Indians meet them, kill as many as they possibly can with spears and
                                Winchesters, register their catch at Unalaska or at Victoria, and
                                take care to be in the Bering Sea by August 1.</p>
                            <p>The number of females is in excess of the number of males, bull or
                                bachelor, and it happens that between 60 and 70 per cent of the
                                skins taken in the spring are those of gravid females. After giving
                                birth to her pup on one or the other of the islands, the mother
                                finds it necessary to make expeditions into the water in search of
                                food. She is sometimes found—and killed, of course—as far as 200
                                miles from the breeding grounds. She swims with marvelous celerity,
                                and thinks nothing of a hundred-mile trip. The bulls do not eat on
                                the islands, and rarely go into the water until they quit the place
                                for the season in September or October, and the superfluous
                                males—the bachelors—have no such summer home. Thus it happens that
                                last year 73 per cent of the American and 56 per cent of the
                                Canadian catch outside of the 60–mile radius consisted of females.
                                More than this. A seal pup deprived of its mother dies of
                                starvation, for no other female will adopt it. Last year more than
                                28,000 pups were found starved to death on the Pribilof Islands,
                                because their mothers had been killed while in search of food beyond
                                the radius. It would be an insult to the reader’s intelligence to
                                point out to him the radical defect and the ultimate outcome of a
                                system under which this kind of thing can flourish. But the
                                difficulty in the way of an easy and satisfactory solution is that
                                in the water it is almost impossible to distinguish between a female
                                and a bachelor seal. It must not be supposed, however, that the men
                                whom the American people are fond of describing as poachers on their
                                seal preserves are Canadians only. About one-half of them are
                                Americans, who “steal that way year by year” from California and
                                Oregon, and in the matter of the illicit use of firearms in the
                                Bering Sea these Americans are notoriously the most unscrupulous. It
                                is satisfactory to know that such repressive measures as may be
                                adopted will operate to the disadvantage of American as well as
                                Canadian pelagic sealers.</p>

                            seal islands of Bering Sea of Professor Thompson and Mr. Macoun.</p>
                        <p>Instructions will at once be given to the authorities on the Pribilof

                            his visit is to act under the direction of Professor Thompson and his
                            assistant. It will further be the pleasure of this Government to afford
                            Mr. Macoun passage on any of the revenue vessels making voyages to those
                            islands, should their movements suit his convenience.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I desire to inquire whether Messrs.
                            Macoun and Barrett Hamilton, who visited the Pribilof Islands last year,
                            have submitted reports to the British or Canadian Governments of the
                            result of their observations, and, if they have made such reports, to
                            ask that I may be furnished with copies of the same if it is the
                            intention to make public use of them. It has been the understanding of
                            this Department that the gentlemen named were acting as the assistants
                            to Professor Thompson, whose report you were good enough to hand me on
                            the 3d instant, audit is presumed their observations were embodied in
                            that report. But if independent reports have been submitted by them and
                            public use is to be made of them hereafter, it is but due to the
                            scientist agents of the Government of the United States who visit the
                            seal islands the present season that they should have the benefit of
                            their observations for comparison and verification.</p>
                        <p>In view, therefore, of the early departure of the agents of the United
                            States for the seal islands, I shall be much gratified if you can give
                            me the desired information with as little delay as possible.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have had under consideration, in
                            communication with Her Majesty’s secretary of state for the colonies,
                            Mr. Sherman’s note of the 9th ultimo on the subject of the fur-seal
                            fishery, of which a copy was inclosed in your excellency’s dispatch, No.
                            98, of the 13th April.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sherman urges that all killing of fur seals should be suspended <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0312"/>for the present, and that a
                            joint conference of the Powers concerned should meet at an early date to
                            agree upon the measures necessary to preserve the seals from
                            extermination and to restore the herd to its normal conditions.</p>
                        <p>The same proposals were made in the note from the United States charge
                            d’affaires of the 10th ultimo, a copy of which was transmitted to your
                            excellency in my dispatch, No. 71, of the 22d April, with instructions
                            as to the answer to be returned to the United States Government on the
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sherman, however, adduces certain statistics in support of the
                            contention that the seals are threatened with early extermination, which
                            makes it necessary for Her Majesty’s Government to deal with his
                            dispatch in a separate communication.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Mr. Sherman’s complaint that the United States Government
                            had not been furnished with a copy of Professor Thompson’s report of his
                            investigations last year, I have to state that Her Majesty’s Government
                            regret the delay that has occurred in the matter. It has been caused
                            partly by Mr. Thompson’s professional duties, and also by the necessity
                            of his waiting for certain notes and information which he had asked Mr.
                            Macoun, the agent of the Dominion Government, to furnish him. The report
                            is, however, now in the hands of the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sherman proceeds to state that, in the absence of Professor
                            Thompson’s report, the President has been forced to reach his
                            conclusions as regards the condition of the seal fishery by a careful
                            study of Dr. Jordan’s report and other ascertained facts and statistics.
                            It is to be regretted that Mr. Sherman has not referred to the passages
                            in Dr. Jordan’s report on which the conclusions of the President have
                            been arrived at. So far as Her Majesty’s Government can judge in the
                            absence of such indications, the President’s conclusions would appear to
                            be based only on general assertions and deductions in that report.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sherman states that Dr. Jordan’s report shows conclusively that there
                            has been a distinct and steady decrease both in the total number of
                            breeding seals and in the number of harems of breeding cows in the
                            season of 1890 as compared with that of 1895, and that it further
                            conclusively appears from the report that this diminution has been
                            caused by pelagic sealing.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Jordan, however, states on page 21 as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>In 1895 Mr. Murray made a careful count of the number of harems
                                    of the two islands, finding 5,000 in all. At the same period in
                                    1896 he found that the number of harems was reduced to 4,853; a
                                    loss of 3⅕ per cent, the number of bulls without harems having
                                    increased 7 per cent.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>On page 16 Dr. Jordan himself gives the number of harems in 1896 as
                            5,009; a small increase on Mr. Murray’s count of 5,000 in 1895, instead
                            of a decrease of less than 3 per cent (not 3⅕ per cent, as calculated by
                            Dr. Jordan). Similarly, as regards the number of breeding cows, Dr.
                            Jordan’s count, as recorded on page 16, gives 81,793 for 1896; while the
                            figures for 1895 as given by himself on page 20 were only 70,423. The
                            state of the rookeries in 1895 as compared in 1896 is fully dealt with
                            by Professor Thompson, and is referred to in my dispatch No. 71 of the
                            22d ultimo, and it is therefore unnecessary to discuss the matter at
                            length. That report also deals, so far as the information at present
                            available is concerned, with the question of the mortality of pups owing
                            to the killing of their mothers at sea, and the general conclusions at
                            which he arrived, as set forth on page 25 of his report, show that the
                            number, 14,473, at which Mr. Sherman places the deaths from this cause,
                            must be subject to very large deductions.</p>
                        <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0313"/>
                        <p>It may be the case, as stated, that it was as easy in 1880 to procure
                            100,000 skins on land of the same quality as those taken during the
                            season of 1896 as it was to obtain the catch of last year, viz, 30,000;
                            but it must not be forgotten that in 1890 not even 30,000 skins could be
                            obtained. The question of the comparative ease or difficulty with which
                            a stated catch was obtained in two years so far apart as 1880 and 1896
                            would, even if the same individuals were employed on each occasion, be
                            an uncertain foundation on which to base any estimate of the comparative
                            numbers of the herd. But Her Majesty’s Government have never denied that
                            the herd has diminished largely since 1880, though they maintain that
                            any share pelagic sealing may have had in bringing about that decrease
                            is insignificant; compared with that of other causes which appear to be
                            overlooked in the United States.</p>
                        <p>If, as alleged, the number of breeding females in 1880. was four times as
                            many as in 1896, or 600,000 in the former year and 150,000 in the
                            latter, while in 1890 there were 280,000, the figures completely
                            negative the conclusion that pelagic sealing has been the cause of the
                            decline, for in the eleven years—1880 to 1890—while the herd was
                            reduced, according to Dr. Jordan’s estimate, by 320,000 breeding
                            females, only 246,902 seals were killed at sea, while in the period 1891
                            to the end of the spring season of 1896 the pelagic catch reached a
                            total of 269,388, and during this period the decrease in the number of
                            breeding cows was only 130,000.</p>
                        <p>A herd of 600,000 breeding cows should mean, according to Dr. Jordan’s
                            estimate, an annual addition of 100,000 breeding cows to the rookeries,
                            yet in the eleven years—1880 to 1890—while the pelagic catch only
                            averaged some 22,000 a year, there was not only no addition to the
                            rookeries, but an average annual decrease of some 30,000. If this
                            enormous loss were entirely due to pelagic sealing, as Dr. Jordan
                            maintains, it would have doubled when pelagic sealing doubled, and the
                            herd ought to have ceased to exist some years ago, yet during the years
                            which followed, with a herd supposed to range from 280,000 to 150,000,
                            with an annual addition of cows to the rookeries which should, if Dr.
                            Jordan is correct, have been from 48,000 to 25,000, the pelagic catch
                            has averaged about 50,000 a year, yet the loss to the rookeries has been
                            only some 25,000.</p>
                        <p>These statistics of Dr. Jordan’s, as set forth in his report, prove
                            clearly that the loss to the herd in the period during which pelagic
                            sealing has been a large factor in the influences affecting it has been
                            insignificant compared with the destruction which went on prior to 1890
                            on the islands, and that the effect on the herd of that mode of sealing
                            is much less serious than that of killing on land restricted to males
                            only.</p>
                        <p>The frequent occurrence, moreover, of seasons characterized like that of
                            last year by weather during which sealing operations at sea are
                            interrupted, affords a natural protection to the herd from exhaustion by
                            pelagic sealing. The difference between the spring catch on the
                            northwest coast in 1895 and 1896 furnished an excellent illustration—52
                            vessels in the former year securing only 8,383 skins, while 41 vessels
                            in 1896 secured 11,786 skins. The falling off in the Bering Sea catch
                            last season, which Mr. Sherman cites as due to the reduction of the
                            herd, was, according to the information in the hands of Her Majesty’s
                            Government, fully explained by the interruptions due to bad weather; and
                            as the great fall in the price of skins has led to a smaller number of
                            vessels fitting out for the fishery this year, their contention that
                            there is no immediate danger to the herd, so far at any rate as pelagic
                            sealing is concerned, appears to be fully justified. But if the
                            proceedings which led to the wholesale reduction of the seals between
                            1880 and 1890 <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0314"/>are resumed, and
                            all the best young male life is destroyed, there can be no question that
                            the herd will at an early date cease to be of commercial importance.</p>
                        <p>In Mr. Sherman’s note the killing of 30,000 males last year is justified
                            on the ground that “it was plain upon scientific investigation that the
                            dangerous mortality among female seals brought about by pelagic sealing
                            had left the number of bulls greatly in excess of the due proportion
                            between the sexes,” and that “to properly care for the herd it became
                            necessary to remove as far as possible this menacing excess of male life
                            upon the islands.”</p>
                        <p>If there was such a “menacing” excess of bulls, it is unfortunate that
                            instead of attempting to reduce the excess, the killing was confined to
                            males who would not become “bulls” able to take a place on the rookeries
                            for another three years, during which period, so far as the killing of
                            1896 is concerned, the alleged excess of bulls on the rookeries will
                            continue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sherman, in the conversation reported in your excellency’s dispatch
                            No. 96, of the 9th April, pointed out that Great Britain was quite as
                            much interested as the United States in the recuperation of the fur-seal
                            species.</p>
                        <p>As a matter of fact, the interest of this country has now for some years
                            exceeded that of the United States, and should the herd be destroyed, a
                            large amount of British capital will be lost, and a large number of
                            British subjects thrown out of employment. They have therefore reason to
                            be more anxious for the establishment of proper regulations than the
                            United States, but the examination of the reports of last year’s
                            investigations, while it has shown that there is no indisputable
                            evidence that the herd has quite recently been decreasing, and that
                            there is no ground therefore for immediate alarm, has also shown that
                            all previous statements as to the numbers of the herd have been
                            conjectural, and that there is consequently no means available for
                            testing the efficiency of the existing regulations, or for showing the
                            direction which any amendment of them should take.</p>
                        <p>To enable a thoroughly satisfactory revision of them to be made accurate
                            statistics should be available, extending over a sufficient period to
                            eliminate accidental circumstances affecting the herd during the greater
                            part of its life, which is spent where observation is impossible.</p>
                        <p>Until such observation is available, it would, in the opinion of Her
                            Majesty’s Government, be premature to enter upon the proposed conference
                            to discuss measures based on conjectures admitted to be of doubtful
                            value, and the interests of this country in the question are too serious
                            to warrant Her Majesty’s Government in imperiling them by the adoption
                            of any hasty decision.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency will read this dispatch to Mr. Sherman and leave a copy
                            of it with him should he desire it.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The British ambassador called upon me on
                            the 3d instant and handed me a copy of a dispatch to him from Her
                            Majesty’s principal secretary of state for foreign affairs, bearing date
                            the 21st ultimo. <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0315"/>This dispatch
                            constitutes the reply of the British Government to the proposals of the
                            President, as presented in the note of your embassy of the 10th ultimo,
                            for a modus vivendi for the suspension of all killing of seals for the
                            present season, and for a joint conference of the Powers concerned with
                            a view to the necessary measures being adopted for the preservation of
                            the fur seal in the North Pacific. It will be seen that both proposals
                            are rejected.</p>
                        <p>I need hardly say that the President is greatly disappointed at this
                            action, especially when it is based upon such unsubstantial and
                            inadequate reasons. The President’s concern, in view of the depleted
                            condition of the seal herd, was occasioned not alone from an examination
                            of Dr. Jordan’s report of 1896 and what he had reason to suppose were
                            the conclusions of Professor Thompson, but it was based upon a series of
                            observations and statistics covering a much longer period than that
                            treated by those gentlemen, establishing a state of facts beyond
                            refutation and which is in part set forth in my note to the British
                            ambassador of the same date as my cablegram to you. It is therefore
                            quite surprising that Her Majesty’s secretary should base his rejection
                            of the proposals of this Government, so impressively presented, upon the
                            report of one scientist whose facts and conclusions are in correctly
                            apprehended and the delayed report of another, which is for the first
                            time made public concurrently with the receipt of his lordship’s
                            note.</p>
                        <p>It would have been gratifying to me and useful to my Government, in
                            studying the important subject under consideration, if Professor
                            Thompson’s report could have been made public with the promptness which
                            marked the appearance of that of Dr. Jordan. In that case there would
                            have been ample time for both Governments to have examined the reports
                            of these two eminent scientists before tire opening of another sealing
                            season. But it seems to have better suited the purposes of Her Majesty’s
                            Government to withhold Professor Thompson’s report until an opportunity
                            was afforded to examine that of Dr. Jordan, and thus enable the former
                            to pass the latter in review, criticise its statements, and as far as
                            possible minimize its conclusions. It is not pleasant to have to state
                            that the impartial character which it has been the custom to attribute
                            to the reports of naturalists of high standing has been greatly impaired
                            by the apparent subjection of this report to the political exigencies of
                            the situation. It is further to be regretted that the report was so long
                            delayed that no opportunity was afforded this Government to examine it
                            before the definite and final rejection of the President’s proposals,
                            based mainly upon its conclusions, was communicated to me. This conduct
                            recalls the incident which preceded the arbitration at Paris, and which
                            came near rendering that arbitration abortive, when a similar report of
                            a British commission was withheld until after the case of each
                            Government was exchanged and the report of the American commission made
                            public.</p>
                        <p>Lord Salisbury asserts that Dr. Jordan’s report does not contain any
                            facts warranting the statement that there is a “depleted condition and
                            prospective early extinction of the herd.” The note of your embassy of
                            the 10th ultimo does not attribute such a statement to Dr. Jordan, but
                            it is difficult to understand how anyone can read his report without
                            reaching the conclusion that such is the real condition of the herd. On
                            page 18 he says: “From this time (1886) on the decline has been more
                            rapid and <hi rend="italic">has been continuous.”</hi> On page 21 he
                            clearly recognizes diminution, as evidenced by photographs, as also by
                            decrease of harems. On page 66 he uses this expression: As the herd <hi rend="italic">is steadily <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0316"/>diminishing</hi>, the spring or northwest catch is becoming
                            relatively unimportant.” Other citations might be made, but it would
                            seem unnecessary in view of his declarations, often repeated in his
                            report, respecting pelagic sealing, from which I give only one extract
                            (p. 29): <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Pelagic sealing, in the judgment of the members of the present
                                    commission, has been <hi rend="italic">the sole cause of the
                                        continued decline</hi> of the fur-seal herds. It is at
                                    present the <hi rend="italic">sole obstacle</hi> to their
                                    restoration and the sole limit of their indefinite increase. It
                                    is therefore evident that no settlement of the fur-seal question
                                    as regards either the American or Russian islands can be
                                    permanent unless it shall provide for the cessation of the
                                    indiscriminate killing of fur seals, both on the sealing grounds
                                    and on their migrations. There can be no “open season” for the
                                    killing of females if the herd is to be kept intact.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Professor Thompson’s report is plainly written with a view to minimize as
                            far as possible the depleted condition of the herd on the Pribilof
                            Islands, and requires a critical examination not possible within the
                            limits of the present instruction, but its general purport may be
                            briefly stated. It is to be regretted that he should have contracted his
                            study far within the purview of his instructions. In the outset of his
                            report he says: “The main object of my mission was the collection of
                            information and statistics with regard to the working and effectiveness
                            of the regulations” of the Paris Tribunal. But we look in vain in his
                            report for any discussion of that all-important subject. He confined his
                            inquiry and report to the subordinate subject of the number of seals
                            resorting to the islands and particularly to the relative numbers in
                            1895 and 1896. The result of his observations and inquiry seemed to be
                            that on some rookeries there was an increase and on others a decrease,
                            but on the whole a possible state of equilibrium for the past two years,
                            although he concedes a diminution as compared with 1892. If all the
                            professor claims is admitted, it does not militate against the
                            contention that since pelagic sealing became general the decline of the
                            herd has been steady and rapid. The apparent equilibrium noted in his
                            report is well explained by Dr. Jordan when he says (p. 18): <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>There is evidence that the modus vivendi of 1892–93, by which
                                    Bering Sea was closed to the sealing fleet, has produced for
                                    1895 and 1896 a slight check of the diminution. The reason for
                                    this is that in addition to the saving of mothers no pups were
                                    starved to death in 1892 and 1893, and those which might have
                                    been starved have returned as breeders or as killable seals in
                                    1895 and 1896.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Since the receipt of Lord Salisbury’s dispatch explicit inquiry has been
                            made by Dr. Jordan as to the relative condition of the herd in 1895 and
                            1896 and in previous years, and he has furnished the chapter on the
                            “Decline of the herd,” from the forthcoming final report of himself and
                            associates, from which the following extract is taken: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>While the amount of the decline can not be stated with
                                    mathematical exactness, it is possible from the data at hand to
                                    make an approximate estimate. From a careful study of all the
                                    conditions, in our opinion the fur-seal herd of the Pribilof
                                    Islands has decreased to about one-fifth its size in 1872–1874;
                                    to somewhat less than one-half its size in 1890; and that
                                    between the seasons of 1895 and 1896 there has been a decrease
                                    of about 10 per cent.</p>

                        <p>Although Professor Thompson has been very careful throughout the report
                            to say nothing likely to embarrass his Government, in the “conclusions,”
                            the voice of the true scientific investigator speaks in firm and certain
                            tones. While he regards “the alarming statements * * * of the herd’s
                            immense decrease” as overdrawn, he says “there is still abundant need
                            for care and for prudent measures of conservation in the interest of
                            all. * * * It is not difficult to believe that the margin of safety is a
                            narrow one, if it be not already in some measure <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0317"/>overstepped. We may hope for a
                            perpetuation of the present numbers; we can not count upon an increase.
                            And it is my earnest hope that a recognition of mutual interests and a
                            regard for the common advantage may suggest measures of prudence which
                            shall keep the pursuit and slaughter of the animal within due and
                            definite bounds.” In view of” such explicit language it is not easy to
                            understand how Lord Salisbury can reconcile his refusal to entertain the
                            proposals of the President with the interests of his own countrymen, to
                            say nothing of the friendly relations which he desires to maintain with
                            the United States, Russia, and Japan.</p>
                        <p>The experience had with the scientific commissions of 1892, as well as
                            the reports of 1896 just under review, shows that it is difficult
                            through them to reach a harmony of views; but we have at hand certain.
                            statistics of undisputed authority pointing unmistakably to conclusions
                            which should be controlling.</p>
                        <p>The operations of the pelagic fleet in Bering Sea since the Paris
                            regulations have been in force are as follows:</p>
                        <p>1894, thirty-seven vessels, 31,585 seals taken, or an average of 853 per
                            vessel.</p>
                        <p>1895, fifty-nine vessels, 44,169 seals taken, or an average of 748 per
                            vessel.</p>
                        <p>1896, sixty-seven vessels, 29,500 seals taken, or an average of 440 per
                            vessel.</p>
                        <p>It thus appears that nearly double the number of vessels in 1896 were not
                            able to take as many seals as were taken in 1894, and the catch per
                            vessel fell off nearly one-half. Lord Salisbury attributes this large
                            falling off in Bering Sea “to the stormy weather prevailing,” but does
                            not cite his authority. I am not aware of any published report to that
                            effect. Captain Hooper, who commanded the American cruising fleet in
                            Bering Sea in 1895 and 1896, reports: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The weather in Bering Sea was not materially different in the
                                    past two years. Conditions admitted of boarding operations by
                                    the fleet twenty-five days in 1895 and twenty-four days in
                                    1896.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>An examination and comparison of the logs of sealing vessels for 1895 and
                            1896 confirm Captain Hooper’s report. The above figures, with the
                            statistics contained in my note of the 9th ultimo to the British
                            ambassador, make it very clear that the seal herd is becoming rapidly
                            depleted, and that “the margin of safety,” as Professor Thompson
                            expresses it, has been “already overstepped.” It is to be inferred that
                            “the margin of safety” is intended to signify the point at which pelagic
                            sealing ceases to be profitable. He can not have in mind biological
                            extermination, for that point could not have been reached so long as a
                            single bull and harem existed. The point when sealing ceased to be
                            profitable seems to have been reached during last year. A table appended
                            to his report shows that the product of the pelagic catch of 1896 in the
                            London market was about half the amount of that of 1895, and Lord
                            Salisbury informs us that this result has “brought many owners of the
                            sealing vessels to the verge of bankruptcy.” It thus appears that the
                            condition of things predicted by the Government of the United States, as
                            quoted below, has already come to pass—the commercial extermination of
                            the seals. If pelagic sealing continues to be tolerated, a limited
                            number of vessels will carry on the indiscriminate slaughter in the
                            hope, by a favorable cruise, of recouping the losses of the previous
                            year, and the rookeries on the islands will be still further depleted.
                            But the biological existence of the fur seal may <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0318"/>still be continued and Her Majesty’s
                            ambassador may repeat the declaration so often made during the past two
                            years that there is “no reason to fear that the seal herd is threatened
                            with early extermination.”</p>
                        <p>In this connection it may not be unprofitable to recall the action of the
                            two Governments respecting the efforts made to revise the regulations
                            adopted at Paris. The expressed object of the Paris Arbitration was “the
                            preservation of the fur seals,” and the regulations adopted by the
                            Tribunal were framed with a view to “the proper protection and
                            preservation of the fur-seal * * * resorting to Bering Sea.” On January
                            23, 1895, Secretary Gresham addressed a note to the British ambassador
                            stating that the first year’s experience had “convinced the President
                            that the regulations enacted by the Paris Tribunal have not operated to
                            protect the seal herd from the destruction which they were designed to
                            prevent,” and he asked that a commission of scientists and experts be
                            appointed by the Governments of the United States, Great Britain,
                            Russia, and Japan to report upon the proper measures to be adopted, and
                            pending the deliberations of the Governments a modus vivendi be agreed
                            upon suspending sealing in Bering Sea. Nearly four months elapsed
                            without an answer from the British Government, when, on May 14, 1895, a
                            second note was sent, reiterating the President’s solicitude, urging a
                            reply, and predicting that unless some further restrictions were adopted
                            the seal would “be exterminated for all commercial purposes within a
                            very few years.” On May 27 the British answer was received, in which it
                            was complacently stated “that the condition of affairs is not of so
                            urgent a character as the President has been led to believe,” and that
                            there was no “such urgent danger of total extinction of the seals as to
                            call for a departure from the arbitral award by which the two nations
                            have solemnly bound themselves to abide.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary Olney, June 24, 1895, by direction of the President, renewed
                            the proposition in different terms, but the British Government repeated
                            its declination to make “any extension of the regulations solemnly laid
                            down by an international board of arbitration.”</p>
                        <p>After a second year’s experience of the regulations, Secretary Olney,
                            March 11, 1896, called the attention of the British ambassador to the
                            catch of 1895 in Bering Sea (the largest ever made in that sea) and
                            expressed the hope that the British Government would realize “the
                            absolute necessity of consenting for the coming season to some further
                            regulation* * * to the end that the valuable herd be saved from total
                            extinction.” On the 27th of April, Sir Julian Pauncefote replied that
                            Her Majesty’s Government saw no reason to believe the catch in Bering
                            Sea was “so large as to threaten early extermination,” and that there
                            was no “necessity for the immediate imposition of increased
                            restrictions.”</p>
                        <p>This correspondence is recalled to show that from the first year the
                            Paris regulations were put in force each succeeding President and
                            Secretary of State has been firmly convinced that they were inadequate
                            for the purpose for which they were adopted, and that the British
                            Government has just as firmly resisted all overtures for even a
                            conference of the Governments concerned for the purpose of considering
                            whether further regulations were required to protect the seals, and has
                            rested its refusal upon “the arbitral award by which the two nations
                            have solemnly bound themselves to abide.”</p>
                        <p>In view of this attitude of the British Government, I deem it opportune
                            to make an examination (even at the risk of being somewhat tedious) into
                            the manner in which it has responded to the action of the <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0319"/>Paris Tribunal, and to what extent and
                            in what spirit it has observed the decision and recommendations of that
                            tribunal.</p>
                        <p>A perusal of the protocols of that tribunal will show that the
                            preparation of the regulations was intrusted to the three arbitrators
                            nominated by the neutral Governments, and when their unanimous report
                            was presented it was provided in article 2 that the regulations should
                            be applied to all the waters of the Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea north
                            of the thirty-fifth degree of north latitude, thereby including all the
                            waters east of Japanese and Russian territory. Lord Hannen, the British
                            arbitrator, objected to this provision and moved an amendment limiting
                            the area to all that part of the ocean and sea east of the one hundred
                            and eightieth meridian. Baron Courcel, president of the tribunal, stated
                            on behalf of the neutral arbitrators that, in framing article 2, “they
                            had acted out of regard for Russia and Japan, powers not respresented
                            before the Tribunal of Arbitration, and toward the waters of whom it
                            appeared not equitable to drive back the English and American pelagic
                            sealers during the whole time of the close season.” But he acquiesced in
                            Lord Hannen’s amendment and it was adopted. (Protocol LIV.) It is plain
                            from the proceedings that the tribunal regarded the extension of the
                            regulations to the Asiatic waters as a matter of justice to Russia and
                            Japan, and they would have been so extended if those powers had been
                            parties to the arbitration.</p>
                        <p>When, in accordance with Article VII of the treaty of 1892, the Russian
                            and Japanese Governments were approached with a view to securing their
                            adhesion to the regulations, they both” replied they could only do so on
                            their extension to the Asiatic waters. Secretary Gresham reports that as
                            early as October, 1893, he verbally brought this attitude of the subject
                            to the attention of the British ambassador, who recognized the force of
                            the position assumed and said the situation seemed to suggest the
                            propriety of a treaty between the four powers “for the preservation, for
                            their common benefit, of the fur seals between the two continents and
                            north of the thirty-fifth degree of north latitude.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bayard was instructed, October 27 and November 20, 1893, to seek to
                            bring about such an arrangement or treaty; January 23, 1894, Mr. Gresham
                            brought the subject to the attention of the British ambassador, and on
                            May 2, no answer being received, the proposition was again urged.
                            Secretary Olney brought the subject again to the attention of the
                            British Government in a note dated June 24, 1895, the proposition being
                            presented in a new form; and on August 19 a general negative reply was
                            made to Mr. Olney’s note.</p>
                        <p>Under date of April 2, 1896, Secretary Olney informed Mr. Bayard that the
                            Russian Government was about to initiate negotiations at London for the
                            extension of the Paris regulations over the Asiatic waters, and at the
                            request of the Government Mr. Bayard was instructed to cooperate in such
                            negotiations. Mr. Bayard at once put himself in communication with the
                            Russian ambassador, but on May 14 he was informed by Lord Salisbury that
                            Her Majesty’s Government had decided to dispatch a naturalist to the
                            Russian seal islands, and that pending the receipt of his report his
                            Government would not enter upon negotiations. The British naturalist
                            returned to Loudon in October, 1896, but up to this date his lordship
                            has given no indication of a desire or intention to open the
                            negotiations. In fact, the dispatch to which I now reply rejects the
                            proposition of the President for a similar conference or negotiation.
                            The effect of Lord Hannen’s amendment of article 2 of the regulations
                            has been to bring about the state of affairs which the neutral
                            arbitrators desired to avoid, to wit, to transfer the <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0320"/>sealing vessels to the Asiatic waters
                            during the closed season in the American waters, which they expected
                            would be prevented by negotiations between the interested Governments.
                            Such negotiations Great Britain has steadily omitted and declined to
                            enter upon.</p>
                        <p>Again, the arbitrators appended to their decision or award a series of
                            declarations, not binding upon the contracting Governments, but which
                            were recommended for their adoption. The American arbitrators at once
                            accepted the declarations, but Lord Hannen hesitated to accept the
                            second paragraph, which is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>In view of the critical condition to which it appears certain
                                    that the race of fur seals is now reduced, in consequence of
                                    circumstances not fully known, the arbitrators think fit to
                                    recommend both Governments to come to an understanding in order
                                    to prohibit any killing of fur seals, either on land or sea, for
                                    a period of two or three years, or at least one year, subject to
                                    such exceptions as the two Governments might think proper to
                                    admit of.</p>
                                <p>Such a measure might be recurred to at occasional intervals if
                                    found beneficial.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Lord Hannen declared that, “although approving the spirit in which it
                            (the second paragraph) is conceived, and although regarding as very
                            desirable that the destruction of the far seals might be entirely
                            suspended during a certain period of time, so as to enable nature to
                            retrieve the losses which this race of animals has undergone, he does
                            not feel authorized by the terms of his mandate to express an opinion on
                            the subject;” and the Canadian arbitrator concurred with his British
                            colleague. (Protocol LIV.)</p>
                        <p>Immediately after the receipt of the official copy of the award and
                            declarations, September 12, 1893, Secretary Gresham cabled instructions
                            to Mr. Bayard to ask the concurrence of Great Britain in the enforcement
                            of the second declaration. Mr. Bayard reported, September 13, that he
                            had made known his instructions to the British Government. No answer
                            having been received on this point, Secretary Gresham repeated the offer
                            to Sir Julian Pauncefote January 21, 1894. I do not find that response
                            to this proposition was ever made. The wisdom of the recommendation is
                            abundantly proved by the experience of the past three years, and it
                            strongly supports the repeated applications which have been made by the
                            Government of the United States for a modus suspending all killing of
                            the seals until a conference could be had to readjust the Paris
                            regulations.</p>
                        <p>The indifference with which the British Government treated the repeated
                            appeals of this Government for prompt action toward the adoption of
                            measures to enforce the regulations “solemnly laid down by an
                            international board of arbitration,” illustrates the measure of respect
                            entertained for that august Tribunal. On September 12, 1893, within a
                            month after the award had been rendered, Secretary Gresham instructed
                            Mr. Bayard by cable (cited above) to inform the British Government of
                            the desire of the Government of the United States to take up without
                            delay the subject of the enforcement of the regulations, so as to make
                            them effective before the next sealing season. This notice was given to
                            the British foreign office September 13, more than three months before
                            the opening of the sealing season. No progress having been made,
                            November 17, Secretary Gresham cabled Mr. Bayard that the President was
                            anxious that an agreement on this subject should speedily be reached. On
                            the 4th of December, Secretary Gresham consented, at the desire of the
                            British Government, that the negotiations might be transferred to
                            Washington, but he gave notice to Lord Rosebery that “the rapidly
                            shortening interval before the next season will commence admonishes both
                            Governments to expedite the negotiations.” On the 24th of January, 1894,
                            the Secretary addressed an urgent note <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0321"/>to the British ambassador, complaining that nothing had
                            yet been accomplished, and the time lost had brought them “to the
                            opening of another sealing season without any definite steps having been
                            taken for the execution of the Paris award.” A month later, February 22,
                            the Secretary cabled Mr. Bayard that, in answer to his repeated
                            inquiries, the British ambassador informed him he was still without
                            instructions, and he was directed to say “this long delay is difficult
                            to understand, and it is the President’s desire that you represent the
                            matter impressively to Her Majesty’s Government.” On March 17, Secretary
                            Gresham sent another urgent cablegram to Mr. Bayard, complaining of
                            still further delay, for which “this Government is not responsible,” and
                            which was threatening to “become embarrassing for both Governments.” The
                            negotiations were not entered upon until six months after they were
                            invited by the United States; the British act (April 23, 1894) to
                            enforce the regulations was not passed until four months after the
                            sealing season had opened, and the final order in council (June 27,
                            1894) on the subject was not issued until six months after the sealing
                            fleet had put to sea in disregard of the award of the Tribunal.</p>
                        <p>The manner in which the British Government has discharged its police
                            duties under the award is in marked contrast with its appeal for a
                            strict observance of the five years’ period of the regulations. An equal
                            obligation rests upon each Government to patrol the waters embraced in
                            the award area, in order to see that the regulations are not violated by
                            the sealing vessels. In 1894 the Government of the United States
                            furnished twelve vessels for the patrolling fleet, at great expense, and
                            only one vessel was furnished by the British Government. In 1895 five
                            United States vessels patrolled the award area and only two British
                            vessels, one for a short time only in Bering Sea, and the other took no
                            part whatever in the patrol, as its presence was almost constantly
                            required in Unalaska Harbor to take over the British sealing vessels
                            seized in Bering Sea. Owing to the repeated complaints of the Government
                            of the United States as to the inadequacy of the British patrol, an
                            additional cruiser was ordered into Bering Sea during the season of
                            1896, although it was stated by the British Government that “so far as
                            they have been able to judge, the force employed up to the present time
                            has been sufficient.”. As it is shown that practically no patrol service
                            had been rendered in Bering Sea by the British cruisers during the
                            previous year, the inference from this language would seem to be that
                            Her Majesty’s Government understood that the American cruisers only were
                            to perform the patrol duty and the British cruiser to take over and act
                            upon the validity of seizure of British vessels.</p>
                        <p>The detailed enforcement of the regulations has further developed on the
                            part of the British Government a strange misconception of the true
                            spirit and intent of the arbitrators. Under article 6 of the regulations
                            the use of firearms in Bering Sea was prohibited, and to enforce that
                            prohibition it was agreed between the two Governments for the year 1894
                            that sealing vessels might have their arms and ammunition placed under
                            seal. But on May 11, 1895, although this Government had every reason to
                            believe from the order in council that the British Government had given
                            its concurrence to the arrangement, the British ambassador gave notice
                            that his Government would not renew the arrangement as to the sealing of
                            arms for the coming season, and defended its action on the ground that
                            the possession of arms, etc., by a sealing vessel was “not forbidden by
                            the award regulations.”</p>
                        <p>This tardy action of the British Government in refusing to renew the
                            arrangement of 1894 led to much trouble and inconvenience in connection
                                <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0322"/>the patrol of Bering Sea.
                            The British Government made grievous complaint against the severe
                            measures of search resorted to by the American cruisers, which gave rise
                            to a lengthy correspondence. On July 2, 1896, Secretary Olney submitted
                            a proposition to put an end to the controversy by an examination of
                            vessels entering Bering Sea and an inspection by a representative of the
                            United States at British Columbian ports of all skins taken in Bering
                            Sea, to discover whether or not firearms were used; but this proposition
                            was not accepted. A further attempt was made by Secretary Olney to
                            procure some agreement for the season of 1897, when it was urged that
                            American vessels frequenting Bering Sea were required to have their arms
                            sealed and on returning to their home ports their skins were carefully
                            inspected, while Her Majesty’s Government refuses to enforce the
                            provision as to arms and declines the inspection of skins—measures which
                            this Government regards as “absolutely essential for preventing the
                            unlawful destruction of the seals.” Nevertheless, another season has
                            been entered upon without any settlement of this vexed question.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I recall the serious defect, pointed out in the
                            correspondence, in the British act for the enforcement of the
                            regulations. Under the British act passed to carry out the modus vivendi
                            of 1891, whereby all killing of seals was prohibited in Bering Sea, it
                            was provided that the presumption of guilt would lie against the vessel
                            “having on board fishing or shooting implements or seal skins.” A
                            provision of a kindred nature was inserted in the British act for the
                            enforcement of the Russian modus of 1893. The act of Congress of 1894 to
                            enforce the regulations of the Paris award contained a similar
                            provision; but the British act of 1894 for the same purpose contained no
                            provision whatever as to presumptive guilt respecting the possession of
                            firearms or skins at forbidden times or in forbidden waters. And to
                            emphasize its purpose in the matter, when the British act to enforce the
                            Russian agreement was reenacted in 1895, the pro vision of the act of
                            1893 as to presumptive illegality was omitted. This action of the
                            British Government was made the subject of an earnest protest on the
                            part of my predecessor, but to no purpose. The practical effect is to
                            make it impossible in many cases to convict British sealing vessels,
                            although there may be the strongest presumptive evidence of guilt,
                            evidence which, under the act of Congress, would in most cases procure
                            the conviction of an American sealing vessel.</p>
                        <p>I shall only cite one further instance of the failure and refusal of the
                            British Government to give full effect to the Paris regulations. Article
                            5 provided that the vessels engaged in sealing should enter daily in
                            their official log books the number and sex of the seals taken and that
                            these entries should be communicated by each Government to the other at
                            the end of each season. This regulation was prescribed in order to
                            procure reliable statistics as to the proportion of female seals killed,
                            but it was found to be unsatisfactory and imperfect in its practical
                            operation. The catch of American vessels was subjected to an official
                            inspection at the home port, and it was found that they reported a much
                            greater proportion of female seals taken than the British sealers.
                            Although in many instances the British sealers were close to the
                            American sealers, yet the American sealers reported from two to five
                            times as many females as males, a result entirely at variance with the
                            British returns. This state of facts led the Acting Secretary of State,
                            May 10, 1895, to request of the British Government their consent to the
                            stationing of United States inspectors at British Columbian ports for
                            the purpose of verifying the log entries of British sealing vessels,
                            with the offer <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0323"/>of a reciprocal
                            privilege in American ports to British inspectors. No answer having been
                            received, on September 13 and again on September 18 the request made in
                            the previous May was renewed. On the 24th of September the British
                            ambassador replied that the request for inspectors was not acceptable to
                            Her Majesty’s Government “on the ground that the matter is already
                            provided for by the award regulations, the sealers being bound
                            themselves to keep a record of sex.”</p>
                        <p>The measure was regarded by this Government as so important that,
                            December 15, 1896, Secretary Olney recalled it to the attention of the
                            British ambassador in connection with the sealing of arms. The answer of
                            the British Government to this second application was that “the
                            compulsory examination by experts of skins on landing at British ports
                            would require legislation in Canada,” and that the views of the Canadian
                            Government would have to be ascertained. In answer to the inquiry of
                            Secretary Olney on January 23, 1897, as to when the Canadian Government
                            was likely to take action, the ambassador replied on March 24 that Her
                            Majesty’s Government were “still in correspondence with the Canadian
                            Government” and that a further communication would be made as soon as
                            possible. No further communication has been made.</p>
                        <p>I regret that this statement has become so lengthy, but in view of the
                            fact that the British Government, when pressed for a remedy to
                            well-established defects in the regulations or the acts and rules agreed
                            upon for their enforcement, has appealed to “the arbitral award by which
                            the two nations have solemnly bound themselves to abide,” I have felt
                            the present occasion opportune to make a review of the events which have
                            transpired since that award was rendered, and to challenge a comparison
                            of the conduct of the two Governments with regard to the final action of
                            the International Tribunal of Arbitration. In no respect has the United
                            States Government failed to observe the exact terms of the award or to
                            accept its recommendations in their true spirit and full effect, even
                            though they have entailed heavy expense and caused great damage to
                            long-established interests of this nation.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, I think I have shown that the British Government has
                            from the beginning and continuously failed to respect the real intent
                            and spirit of the Tribunal or the obligations imposed by it. This is
                            shown by the refusal to extend the regulations to the Asiatic waters; by
                            the failure to put in operation the recommendation for a suspension of
                            the killing of the seals for three, for two, or even for one year; by
                            the neglect to put the regulations in force until long after the first
                            sealing season had been entered on; by the almost total evasion of the
                            patrol duty; by the opposition to suitable measures for the enforcement
                            of the prohibition against firearms; by the omission to enact
                            legislation necessary to secure conviction of the guilty; and by the
                            refusal to allow or provide for an inspection of skins in the interest
                            of an honest observance of the regulations.</p>
                        <p>The obligations of an international award, which are equally imposed on
                            both parties to its terms, can not properly be assumed or laid aside by
                            one of the parties only at its pleasure. Such an award which in its
                            practical operation is binding only on one party in its obligations and
                            burdens, and to be enjoyed mainly by the other party in its benefits, is
                            an award which, in the interest of public morality and good conscience,
                            should not be maintained. Having in view the expressed object of the
                            arbitration at Paris and the declared purpose of the arbitrators in
                            prescribing the regulations, when it became apparent, as it did after
                            the first year’s operation of them and with increased emphasis each <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0324"/>succeeding year, that the
                            regulations were inadequate for the purpose, it was the plain duty of
                            the British Government to acquiesce in the request of that of the United
                            States for a conference to determine what further measures were
                            necessary to secure the end had in view by the arbitration.</p>
                        <p>A course so persistenly followed for the past three years has practically
                            accomplished the commercial extermination of the fur seals and brought
                            to naught the patient labors and well-meant conclusions of the Tribunal
                            of Arbitration. Upon Great Britain must therefore rest, in the public
                            conscience of mankind, the responsibility for the embarrassment in the
                            relations of the two nations which must result from such conduct. One of
                            the evil results is already indicated in the growing conviction of our
                            people that the refusal of the British Government to carry out the
                            recommendations of that Tribunal will needlessly sacrifice an important
                            interest of the United States. This is shown by the proposition
                            seriously made in Congress to abandon negotiations and destroy the seals
                            on the islands, as the speedy end to a dangerous controversy, although
                            such a measure has not been entertained by this Department. We have felt
                            assured that as it has been demonstrated that the practice of pelagic
                            sealing, if continued, will not only bring itself to an end, but will
                            work the destruction of a great interest of a friendly nation, Her
                            Majesty’s Government would desist from an act so suicidal and so
                            unneighborly, and which certainly could not command the approval of its
                            own people.</p>
                        <p>The President therefore cherishes the hope that, even at this late day,
                            the British Government may yet yield to his continued desire, so often
                            expressed, for a conference of the interested powers; and, in delivering
                            to Lord Salisbury a copy of this instruction, you will state to him that
                            the President will hail with great satisfaction any indication on the
                            part of Her Majesty’s Government of a disposition to agree upon such a
                            conference.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I had the honor of informing you verbally
                            on the 3d instant, under telegraphic instructions from Her Majesty’s
                            principal secretary of state, that her Majesty’s Government are prepared
                            to agree to the renewal of the arrangement made in 1894 for the sealing
                            up by a duly authorized officer, on the application of the master, of
                            the arms on board a vessel proceeding to the fishery in Bering Sea, or
                            returning to port during the close season, but that the Canadian
                            Government found themselves unable to concur in the suggestion that the
                            skins landed from the British sealing fleet should be examined at the
                            port of destination by American experts. The proposals of the United
                            States Government in regard to both these points were contained in your
                            predecessor’s note to me of December 15, 1896.</p>
                        <p>I am now in receipt of a dispatch from the Marquis of Salisbury, stating
                            the grounds on which this decision was arrived at. As regards the
                            proposed inspection of skins, the Canadian Government are convinced that
                            even were it possible to establish that any punctures which might be
                            found in the seal skins were the results of gunshot wounds, and that
                            they could be readily distinguished from those made by spears, <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0325"/>it would still be impossible to
                            prove that the animal from which the pelt was taken had been killed by
                            means of firearms. It is a matter, it is said, of common knowledge that
                            the skins of a large number of seals killed by spears contain shot
                            wounds, so that no weight can be attached to any argument derived from
                            these wounds as to the manner whereby the ultimate capture of the seal
                            was effected. There is no means of proving that these shot wounds were
                            not received during the migration of the seals outside Bering Sea, where
                            the use of firearms is not prohibited, or that they may not have been
                            inflicted by the crew of a vessel other than the one by which the seal
                            was eventually secured by the spear. Moreover, sealers, knowing that an
                            examination such as that suggested awaited them and their destination,
                            could readily add a spear wound to the skin had the seal been shot, thus
                            effectually destroying the utility of any such test.</p>
                        <p>The case of the <hi rend="italic">Kate</hi> is referred to by the
                            Canadian authorities as illustrating the force of the above remarks. As
                            you are aware, this vessel was seized last season because certain skins
                            were found on board believed to have shot holes in them, though it was
                            afterwards found that the vessel had no firearms whatever on board.</p>
                        <p>The Canadian Government are further of opinion that an examination of the
                            salted skins when landed at the home ports would prove of little use in
                            establishing the sex of the seals killed. They state that when the
                            United States Treasury circular, which is referred to in Mr. Olney’s
                            note, first came into their possession, the matter was exhaustively
                            considered and the conclusion reached that the tests therein indicated
                            were wholly ineffective for determining the question of sex.</p>

                            Government was prepared to agree to a renewal of the arrangement made in

                        <p>In reply, I desire to say that the Government of the United States
                            consents that the provisions of the rules and regulations prescribed by
                            the President under the act of Congress approved April 6, 1894, for the
                            government of United States vessels employed in fur-seal fishing during
                            the season of 1897 shall be extended for the remainder of the present
                            season to British sealing vessels.</p>
                        <p>Although article 8 of the said regulations is not applicable to British
                            sealing vessels, I respectfully suggest that Her Majesty’s Government be
                            asked to require of said vessels the information under oath called for
                            by form catalogue 204, copies of which I take pleasure in inclosing.</p>
                        <p>In case you are authorized to accept the terms of the regulations of
                            1897, copy of which I also inclose, I shall be glad to cause the slight
                            changes that it will be necessary to make to the end that the

                            the 18th ultimo, in which I informed you that Her Majesty’s Government
                            were prepared to agree to a renewal for the season of 1897 of the
                            arrangement made in 1894 relating to the sealing up of arms, etc., with
                            a view to the protection from unnecessary interference of sealing
                            vessels proceeding to the fishery in Bering Sea, or returning to port
                            during the close season.</p>
                        <p>You now inform me that the United States Government consent to extend to
                            British vessels the regulations prescribed by the President under an act
                            of Congress for United States vessels during the fishery season of 1897
                            (a copy of which you inclose), and you inquire whether I am authorized
                            to accept the terms of those regulations, in which case certain changes
                            would be made in them so as to adapt them to British vessels.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to state in reply that I have no authority to agree to
                            the application of those regulations to British sealing vessels. The
                            latter are governed by regulations of a similar character prescribed
                            under powers derived from a British act of Parliament, and any extension
                            or alteration of them imposing any new restrictions or obligations would
                            require the sanction of a further British order in council.</p>
                        <p>The arrangement of 1894 as to the sealing up of arms, being of an
                            entirely voluntary character, required no legislation, and it can be
                            renewed for the present season merely by instructions to the naval or
                            other officials charged to carry it out. I should be much obliged if you
                            would be good enough to inform me whether the proposal on the subject
                            conveyed to you in my note of the 18th ultimo is agreeable to your
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>In the meanwhile I shall not fail to transmit your note now under reply
                            to the Marquis of Salisbury for the consideration of Her Majesty’s
                            Government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of the 9th instant, in reply to mine of the 7th, in
                            which you state that British sealing vessels are now subject to
                            regulations prescribed under acts of Parliament, and that any extensions
                            or alterations imposing any new restrictions would require a further
                            order in council to bear any force or validity. You further state that
                            the regulations prescribed for American sealing vessels for the season
                            of 1897 go beyond the scope of the so called arrangement of 1894, and
                            therefore in the absence of a new order in council you are not empowered
                            to agree upon said regulations. You conclude by stating that the
                            arrangement of 1894 was of a largely voluntary nature, and you ask
                            whether your proposition to agree to a renewal of such arrangement is
                            acceptable to my Government.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to reply that I am well informed that the regulations
                            for 1897 now applicable to American sealing vessels contain much that is
                            beyond the scope of the agreement of 1894, which was merely of a
                            temporary and provisional nature, the same being prepared hastily during
                            the early part of May, 1894, after the sealing fleet had put to sea. It
                            is evident, therefore, that to accept the said regulations of 1897, a
                            new order in council will be necessary, but I had no reason to assume
                            that your Government would not be willing to enact a proper order in
                            council to bring about this result.</p>
                        <p>The provisions of the arrangement of 1894, as I have stated, were merely
                            of a temporary and provisional nature. Experience has shown the
                            necessity of further and more stringent regulations properly to carry
                            out the true intent and purpose of the Paris award. For example, there
                            were no provisions in the arrangement of 1894 as to lights on sealing
                                <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0328"/>vessels at night, nor as to
                            storing of arms, nor as to the sworn returns required of American
                            vessels, nor was there anything contained in said arrangement as to the
                            inspection of seal skins landed in ports of the United States or Great
                            Britain. The latter safeguard (the inspection of skins by pelagic
                            inspectors) the United States regards of the utmost importance.</p>
                        <p>Even with all these precautions, however, American sealing vessels
                            undergo rigid search when met at sea by American cruisers. If, on
                            examination, all firearms found on board are sealed, this fact
                            constitutes evidence that they have not been used since the sealing up
                            for illegal purposes and may save the vessel from seizure in those cases
                            where skins are found on board with some evidence of having been
                            shot.</p>
                        <p>It is not unnatural that both Governments should desire that the
                            inevitable annoyance caused by the searching of vessels should be
                            reduced to a minimum. My predecessor, on July 2, 1896, made certain
                            suggestions which would certainly have reduced to a minimum this
                            annoyance, at least as regards vessels clearing direct from Victoria for
                            Bering Sea. His suggestions were: First, that all British sealing
                            vessels, before entering Bering Sea, should be searched at Unalaska by
                            United States revenue officers, and the fact that they have on board no
                            firearms should be duly certified to; secondly, that all skins landed by
                            said vessels should be examined by expert inspectors at the home port to
                            discover whether any had been shot. The reply of your Government,
                            communicated by Lord Gough on September 21, 1896, was substantially to
                            the effect that unless said preliminary search and certificate should
                            absolutely exempt British vessels from further search by American
                            cruisers, the proposition could not be entertained. Your Government also
                            declined to authorize the examination of skins landed in British ports
                            by pelagic inspectors, on the ground, among others, as stated in your
                            note, dated May 18, that such examination was not of practical
                            value.</p>
                        <p>Although the British Government may not consider such an inspection of
                            value, it is to be regretted that it could not have consented to such an
                            inspection, in view of the fact that the United States Government,
                            advised by eminent experts, deemed it of great value, and was willing to
                            make certain arrangements, based in part upon such examination which
                            would, as stated above, reduce to a minimum the inevitable annoyance
                            resulting from a search by our cruising vessels.</p>
                        <p>I regret that the views of the right of search, expressed by my
                            predecessor in his note to you of December 15, 1896, are not agreeable
                            to your Government. I feel constrained to state that this Government
                            regards this right as indispensable to a proper execution of the intent
                            and spirit of the Paris award. The fact that firearms are sealed up has
                            not in practice released American sealing vessels from most rigid search
                            whenever fallen in with by an American cruiser, nor should any different
                            result follow in the case of a British sealing vessel.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact, however, that said sealing up may be regarded
                            oftentimes as a most important piece of evidence to prove that the
                            vessel has not used, illegally, firearms in Bering Sea, and that sealing
                            up may relieve the patrolling vessels of much extra trouble, this
                            Government is willing to give to British vessels the benefit of articles
                            4, 5, and 6 of the regulations controlling American sealing vessels for
                            the season of 1897, and it will accordingly so instruct its naval
                            officers, should your Government intimate its desire to this effect; at
                            the same time informing said officers that the fact of sealing up
                            firearms shall afford <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0329"/>to
                            British vessels the same protection and immunity against seizure after
                            search as is now afforded American vessels.</p>
                        <p>I would respectfully suggest an answer to this suggestion at your
                            earliest convenience in order that proper instructions may be speedily
                            prepared to officers of the patrolling fleet.</p>

                        <p>I would beg leave to point out that the above reply hardly answers the
                            inquiry of my Government.</p>
                        <p>The arrangement of 1894 was a reciprocal one, for the mutual benefit of
                            the sealing vessels of both nations. Its discontinuance at the desire of
                            the Canadian sealers has been deprecated ever since by your Government,
                            at whose instance, therefore, it may be said it is now proposed to renew
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The precise terms of the arrangement were settled by the then Secretary
                            of the Treasury (the Hon. J. Carlisle) and myself, and they are to be
                            found recorded in my note to the late Mr. Secretary Gresham of May 10,
                            1894.</p>
                        <p>If your Government should be disposed to renew that arrangement, as
                            proposed by my Government, for the season of 1897, there will be no
                            difficulty in extending its benefits reciprocally to the sealing vessels
                            of both nations.</p>
                        <p>But your counter proposal “to extend to British vessels the benefits of
                            Articles IV, V, and VI of the regulations controlling American sealing
                            vessels for the season of 1897” is not one which I am authorized to deal
                            with otherwise than by transmitting it to my Government by the earliest
                            opportunity.</p>

                            receipt of the note of the British ambassador of the 20th instant, in
                            answer to the Department’s No. 704, of the 18th, relative to sealing
                            regulations for British vessels in Bering Sea. Sir Julian Pauncefote
                            states that the offer of the Government of the United States to give to
                            British vessels the benefit of Articles IV, V, and VI of the regulations
                            controlling American sealing vessels for the season of 1897 does not
                            answer the inquiry of his Government as to whether or not this
                            Government will accept the arrangement of 1894 for the coming season of
                            1897.</p>
                        <p>I have to say in reply, as stated in the Department’s note of the 18th

                            provisions of the arrangements of 1894 were necessarily of a temporary
                            and provisional nature, and are deemed by me inadequate to properly
                            carry out the intent and purpose of the Paris award. I regret,
                            therefore, to have to state the proposition to agree to a renewal of
                            said arrangements is not acceptable to this Government.</p>
                        <p>Trusting that the decision of the British Government as to the offer to
                            give the British sealers the benefit of Articles IV, V, and VI of the
                            regulations of 1897 will receive early and favorable consideration,
                            because of the limited time in which to issue instructions to carry out

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Further referring to Sir Julian
                            Pauncefote’s note of June 13 last, in which the information is contained
                            that the sloop <hi rend="italic">Wild Swan</hi> and the gunboat <hi rend="italic">Pheasant</hi> will be employed in Bering Sea on patrol
                            duties this season, I am constrained to express the deep regret of the
                            President at the obvious inadequacy of the proposed fleet. Five vessels
                            have been designated by the President for this purpose, and in view of
                            the area to be patrolled and of the number of sealing vessels which have
                            already engaged in and are preparing to fit out for sealing operations
                            this season, the President hopes that Her Majesty’s Government will
                            decide for the present season to add to the fleet of three vessels
                            employed last season rather than to reduce its numbers. The President
                            believes it to be impossible properly to execute the laws enacted to
                            enforce the Paris award unless a larger fleet be designated by Her
                            Majesty’s Government.</p>
                        <p>An early reply to this note will be appreciated, as the President fears
                            that the designation of two vessels only by Her Majesty’s Government
                            would be accepted by the sealers as evidence of an abandonment of the
                            patrol, which would render it necessary for him to detail a much larger
                            fleet of United States vessels for this season.</p>
                        <p>It is unnecessary in this connection to repeat what I have already stated
                            in my instruction to Mr. Hay, dated May 10, 1897, as to the inadequacy
                            of the British patrolling fleet during the past three years in which the
                            Paris award has been in operation.</p>

                            itself a sufficient guaranty. Such certificates are already carried by

                            same time to enter the fact upon the vessel’s log.</p>

                            Bering Sea, I have now the honor to inform you that a copy thereof was

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In obedience to your instruction by cable,
                            dated July 1, and after consultation with Mr. Foster, as suggested by
                            you, I asked for a special audience with Lord Salisbury for the purpose
                            of laying before him your proposition for a conference of the powers
                            interested in the preservation of the fur seal, to be held at Washington
                            in October next. I informed him that Russia had promised through Mr.
                            Foster to take part in such a conference, and that we had reason to hope
                            that Japan would also participate; and that the President especially
                            desired that the Government of Her Majesty should also be represented in
                            any such consultation that might take place.</p>
                        <p>Lord Salisbury asked me under what instructions the conference would
                            meet. I had been told by General Foster that it was not contemplated
                            that the representatives of any of the powers should be bound by
                            imperative instructions, nor that the powers taking part should be
                            considered as pledged to any positive line of action; that the meeting
                            would be merely consultation as to the best means of preserving seal
                            life in Bering Sea. I explained this to Lord Salisbury. He replied that
                            before giving me a definite answer it would be necessary for him to
                            consult his colleagues of the colonial office; that the question was
                            essentially a colonial one; that England was in this, respect rather the
                            trustee for Canada than the principal; that he hoped later to be able to
                            speak more definitely; that in principle he was in favor of any
                            practicable action which would result in the preservation of the seals,
                            though he did not at present agree with us upon the facts bearing upon
                            the question of the threatened extermination of the herd.</p>
                        <p>After some further conversation on the subject, I asked him if he would
                            approve of our discussing the matter with the right Hon. Joseph
                            Chamberlain, the secretary of state for the colonies. He said he would
                            be glad if we would do so. I have accordingly made an appointment for
                            Mr. Foster with Mr. Chamberlain for next Saturday, “the first minute,”
                            he says, “he has disengaged.”</p>
                        <p>As I have before observed to you in this correspondence, the attention of
                            the Government seems to be devoted exclusively this year to the
                            cultivation of the imperial idea in the colonies, and nothing will be
                            done which will militate against this sentiment.</p>
                        <p>I have had some conversation with the Japanese minister at this court, in
                            which he showed a favorable disposition to the project of a conference
                            at Washington. Mr. Foster will converse further with him on the
                            subject.</p>

                            Canada.</p>
                        <p>I have also brought him into communication with Mr. de Staal, Russian
                            ambassador at this court. General Foster will report to you the result
                            of these interviews, which have been very satisfactory and promise
                            favorable results. I have on my part had frequent conversations with my
                            Russian and Japanese colleagues and other officials interested.</p>
                        <p>On Thursday last I had a brief conversation with Lord Salisbury, in which
                            I referred to our former conversation on the same matter, and expressed
                            the hope that after all the exchange of opinion which has now taken
                            place between him and the different colonial authorities, whom he had
                            consulted in reference to the Bering Sea matter, he might see his way to
                            giving us a definite and favorable answer on the subject of the
                            conference. He replied that he had reason to believe he might within a
                            few days conclude the matter. In a conversation with Sir Julian
                            Pauncefote I received similar encouragement.</p>
                        <p>I am unwilling to believe that the recent publication of some of the
                            correspondence touching these questions will cause the British ministry
                            to modify their views in relation to them or prevent the action we were
                            hopefully anticipating.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: In the last paragraph of
                                the dispatch addressed to you by Mr. Sherman, under date of the 10th
                                of May last, and communicated by you to me on the 22d of that month,
                                a wish is expressed for a conference of the powers interested in the
                                fur-seal fishery of the North Pacific.</p>
                            <p>In reply I have to state that Her Majesty’s Government are willing to
                                agree to a meeting of experts nominated by Great Britain and Canada
                                and by the United States, in October next, when the further
                                investigations to be made on the islands during the present season
                                will have been completed.</p>
                            <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0335"/>
                            <p>The object of the meeting would be to arrive, if possible, at correct
                                conclusions respecting the numbers, conditions, and habits of the
                                seals frequenting the Pribilof Islands at the present time, as
                                compared with the several seasons previous and subsequent to the
                                Paris award.</p>
                            <p>It seems to Her Majesty’s Government that Washington would be the
                                most suitable place for such a meeting.</p>
                            <p>The other portions of Mr. Sherman’s dispatch, in so far as they
                                require any reply from Her Majesty’s Government, have been answered
                                by anticipation in dispatches which I have addressed to Her
                                Majesty’s ambassador at Washington on the 22d of April and 7th of
                                May last, and which have been communicated to the Government of the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In reply to your note, No. 768, of the
                            31st ultimo, I have the honor, in compliance with an instruction
                            received from Her Majesty’s principal secretary for foreign affairs, to
                            draw your attention to the fact that Her Majesty’s Government have
                            merely agreed to a meeting, to be held at Washington, of experts
                            nominated by the United States, Great Britain, and the Dominion of
                            Canada, in order by due consideration of the reports drawn up by the
                            said experts to arrive at correct conclusions respecting the condition
                            of the seal herd frequenting the Pribilof Islands.</p>
                        <p>In agreeing to such a meeting Her Majesty’s Government never, of course,
                            anticipated that their doing so would be construed as an assent to a
                            proposal for an international conference.</p>
                        <p>I am at the same time directed to point out that neither Russia nor Japan
                            have any experts in a position corresponding to that of the
                            commissioners who have been carrying on their investigations upon the
                            Pribilof Islands during the past two years; and, moreover, that neither
                            of the two countries in question possesses any direct interest in the
                            herd frequenting those islands.</p>

                        <p>We have not understood Great Britain pledged to anything beyond tenor of
                            Salisbury note July 28. But its terms should be construed in light of
                            your preceding interviews with him and your note July 29. <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0338"/>Russia and Japan had previous to that
                            date been invited and have accepted invitation to conference in October.
                            We have supposed Great Britain would not object to attendance of Russian
                            and Japanese delegates at meeting of experts of United States and Great
                            Britain and have benefit their observations and conclusions. If Great
                            Britain insists in withdrawing from conference after the experts have
                            concluded their labors, it is understood she is free to do so. Urge
                            early answer to our request to be informed when British experts will be
                            in Washington, and have date, if possible, not later than October

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit a copy of a
                            telegram sent you yesterday. Deciphered, it is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I received your cabled instruction of the 20th of September in due time;
                            but as Lord Salisbury was out of town, at his place in the country, and
                            as he usually comes in on Wednesday afternoons to receive the diplomatic
                            body, I waited till that day to ask an interview with him. Unfortunately
                            he remained out of town on that day. I therefore went on Thursday to see
                            Sir Thomas Sanderson, the permanent undersecretary for foreign affairs,
                            and represented to him the earnest desire of my Government that as early
                            a date as possible should be fixed for the meeting of the conference,
                            which had been agreed upon for the month of October, between the
                            British, Russian, Japanese, and American Governments. He told me he was
                            not acquainted with the state of the business, took a note of my
                            request, and then added that the British Government had only consented
                            to a meeting of English, Canadian, and American experts. I expressed my
                            surprise at this, referred to my conversations with Lord Salisbury, in
                            which I had expressly stated, without objection on the part of his
                            lordship, that Russia and Japan would be invited to take part in the
                            conference; it was true, I said, that Lord Salisbury, in his note
                            consenting to a conference, had not mentioned the participation of other
                            powers, but I had immediately, in acknowledging receipt of his note,
                            called to his attention the fact of the invitation having been extended
                            to Russia and Japan. Sir Thomas Sanderson assented to this, and told me
                            he would give the matter his attention.</p>
                        <p>The next morning I saw in the Times a telegram from Ottawa announcing,
                            apparently on authority, that the British and Dominion Governments
                            objected to meeting the representatives of Russia and Japan in
                            conference. This, taken in connection with what I had heard the day
                            before, I thought required immediate attention. I was drafting a note to
                            Lord Salisbury on the subject when I received a visit from Mr. Villiers,
                            the undersecretary of state, in whose department this matter more
                            immediately lies. He told me that several days ago the foreign office
                            had instructed Mr. Adam, the chargé d’affaires of the British embassy in
                            Washington, to acquaint you with the view of Her Majesty’s Government
                                <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0339"/>in regard to the
                            participation of Russia and Japan in the conference. I once more
                            recalled to him, as I had to Sir Thomas Sanderson, that I had constantly
                            kept in view in my conversations with Lord Salisbury the expectation of
                            the President that representatives of both Russia and Japan would take
                            part in the conference, and that I had, in my note of the 29th of July,
                            renewed that intimation without objection from the British Government.
                            He said the conference was one of experts, that Russia and Japan had no
                            experts, and that they had no interests at stake in the preservation of
                            the Pribilof herd.</p>
                        <p>I told him, in view of the fact that the President had invited, with the
                            knowledge and presumed assent of the British Government, the Governments
                            of Russia and Japan to participate in the conference, and that these
                            Governments had accepted the invitation, it would now be difficult, if
                            not impossible, to exclude them; but that I would report to you our
                            conversation, and await your further instructions.</p>
                        <p>He further informed me that they had inquired of Mr. D’Arcy Thompson what
                            would be the earliest date at which he could be in Washington, and would
                            let me know his reply as soon as received. Sir Julian Pauncefote, it is
                            thought, will not be able to sail before the 24th of October.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I received your cabled instruction of the
                            25th on Sunday, the 26th. On Monday morning I arranged for an interview
                            with Mr. Villiers at the foreign office, as Lord Salisbury is still
                            absent from London. I communicated to Mr. Villiers the substance of your
                            instruction, of which he took note, and, after some conversation, he
                            said, he would write to Lord Salisbury by that day’s post and hoped to
                            have an answer on the following day. He added, however, that it might be
                            necessary to consult the colonial office, in which case a delay of a day
                            or two would be possible.</p>
                        <p>During the week 1 made several inquiries, direct and indirect, which
                            merely developed .the fact that an interchange of views was going on
                            between the foreign and colonial offices, which consumed a good deal of
                            time owing to the absence of Mr. Chamberlain in Italy, Lord Salisbury
                            not being willing to decide the matter without the full assent of the
                            colonial authorities. On Saturday night I received your cabled
                            instruction of that date, which I answered the next day; both telegrams
                            are inclosed in this dispatch.</p>
                        <p>On Monday I went to the foreign office and saw Mr. Villiers. I
                            represented to him how urgent was the necessity that my Government
                            should receive a definite answer in regard to the conference. He went
                            into detail as to the communications which had been passing between Lord
                            Salisbury, Mr. Chamberlain, and the colonial office, showing that it had
                            been impossible to give us an answer up to that date. He again assured
                            me that every effort would be made to reply definitely to our inquiries
                            on Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
                        <p>To-day I received a note from Mr. Villiers, a copy of which I inclose,
                            informing me that Mr. Adam has been instructed by telegraph to

                                inform you that late last night a telegram was sent to Mr. Adam
                                instructing him to point out to the United States Government that if
                                Russian and Japanese delegates were to attend this would alter the
                                character and objects of the meeting of experts nominated by Great
                                Britain, the United States, and Canada, to which assent was given in
                                Lord Salisbury’s note of July 28.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Adam is therefore to express the great regret of Her Majesty’s
                                Government that it will not be possible for them to send a delegate
                                to a meeting so constituted. Moreover, they do not see that either
                                Russia or Japan could take part usefully in such a meeting of
                                experts to consider the condition of the seal herd frequenting the
                                Pribilofs. But if the Russian and Japanese Governments should so

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">.Sir</hi>: With reference to the communication, made
                            to Her Majesty’s Government on the 27th ultimo by the United States
                            ambassador in London, expressing the desire of the Government of the
                            United States for the admission of delegates from Russia and Japan to
                            assist at the meeting of experts respecting the fur-seal fishery
                            question, I have the honor, in compliance with an instruction from the
                            Marquis of Salisbury, to point out that such a course would change the
                            character and objects of the meeting of experts to be nominated by Great
                            Britain, Canada, and the United States, to which his lordship assented,
                            on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government, in his note to Mr. Hay of the
                            28th of July last.</p>
                        <p>I am accordingly directed to express to you the great regret of Her
                            Majesty’s Government that it will not be possible for them to send a
                            delegate to a meeting constituted in the manner suggested by Mr. Hay on
                            the 27th ultimo.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s Government fail to perceive that any useful purpose could
                            be served by the participation of Russia or Japan in a meeting of
                            experts appointed to consider the state of the seal herd frequenting the
                            Pribilof Islands.</p>
                        <p>However, Her Majesty’s Government see no objection to copies of the
                            proceedings of the meeting of British and United States experts being
                            supplied to the Governments of Russia and Japan, should they wish to
                            have them.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I had the honor to receive in due course
                            of the mail your note dated from Manchester, Mass., on the 22d ultimo,
                            in which, in replying to my note of the 31st of August, you draw
                            attention to the fact that Her Majesty’s Government has merely agreed to
                            a meeting of experts nominated by the United States, Great Britian, and
                            the Dominion of Canada; that Her Majesty’s Government never anticipated
                            that this act would be construed as an assent to a proposal for an
                            international conference; that neither Russia nor Japan have any experts
                            in a position corresponding to that of the commissioners who have been
                            carrying on investigations on the Pribilof Islands during the past two
                            years, and that neither of the two countries in question possesses any
                            direct interest in the herd frequenting those islands.</p>
                        <p>While I make careful note of these declarations on the part of your
                            Government, I desire to say that neither in my note of the 31st of
                            August nor in any other communication made by this Department to Her
                            Majesty’s Government has the action of that Government been construed in
                            any other manner than was warranted by the language employed by Lord
                            Salisbury in his note to Mr. Hay of July 28 last, and by the
                            circumstances which occasioned the sending of that note. His lordship’s
                            note is in its terms a reply to the last paragraph of my instruction to
                            Mr. Hay of May 10 last, and in that paragraph the British Government was
                            invited to “a conference of the powers interested” in the preservation
                            of the seals, and which powers, as appears from other portions of that
                            instruction, were the United States, Great Britain, Russia, and Japan;
                            but I recall to your attention the fact that his lordship’s note had
                            been preceded by a conference early in July between him and Mr. Hay by
                            special appointment, in which his lordship was informed that it was the
                            desire of the Government of the United States to hold a conference at
                            Washington, in October next, of the powers interested in the
                            preservation of the seals: that Russia had already accepted an
                            invitation to such conference; that there was reason to hope that Japan
                            would also participate, and that the President desired that Her
                            Majesty’s Government should also be represented.</p>
                        <p>His lordship was also informed that it was not expected that the powers
                            taking part should be considered as pledged to any positive line of
                            action, and that the meeting would be for consultation as to the best
                            means of preserving seal life. In this conference his lordship promised
                            to give Mr. Hay an answer after consulting with his colleagues of the
                            colonial office. This interview was followed by another later in the
                            month of July, in which the subject was alluded to, and an early answer
                            to Mr. Hay’s invitation was promised. Lord Salisbury’s note of July 28
                            was acknowledged on the day following its date, and his lordship’s
                            attention was recalled to the interviews in which it was made known that
                            it was expected the Governments of Russia and Japan would be represented
                            at the conference.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States has not understood that Great Britain
                            was pledged to anything beyond the tenor of Lord Salisbury’s note of
                            July 28. But I felt justified in construing it in the light of Mr. Hay’s
                            interviews with, and his note of July 29 to, his lordship. In view of
                            these facts I have proceeded upon the understanding that the delegates
                            of Russia and Japan would be present at the meeting of the experts of
                            the United States and Great Britain and would have the benefit <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0342"/>of their observations and
                            conclusions. I have also understood that if Great Britain should insist
                            upon withdrawing from the conference after the experts had concluded
                            their labors she would be free to do so.</p>
                        <p>In answer to your reference to the absence of expert knowledge on the
                            part of Russia and Japan as to the Pribilof Islands, I beg to say that,
                            however this may be, the United States has always contended that a
                            proper understanding and settlement of the seal question involved a
                            study of the conditions of seal life in the entire area of the North
                            Pacific Ocean. Both the United States and Great Britain have proceeded
                            upon this theory, as during the past two years, while they have been
                            conducting investigations on the Pribilof Islands, they have likewise
                            sent their scientists to study seal life on the Asiatic side of the same
                            waters. I have presumed that in the contemplated conference the
                            scientists of both the United States and Great Britain who have visited
                            the Asiatic seal islands during the past two years would be present and
                            give the Powers interested the benefit of their investigations. In
                            addition to the useful information they would doubtless contribute, I am
                            informed that the Russian Government has named the governor (and for
                            many years a resident) of the Russian seal islands as one of its
                            delegates to the conference; and I have no doubt the Japanese delegates
                            will be able to furnish valuable expert knowledge of the general
                            subject. I think, therefore, that it will be unfortunate for the proper
                            solution of this long-debated question if the British Government should
                            fail to have present its own scientist who has for the past two years
                            visited the Asiatic seal islands, or should not receive the information
                            which the Russian and Japanese delegates may be prepared to submit to
                            the conference.</p>
                        <p>It is true, as asserted by Lord Salisbury, that neither Russia nor Japan
                            possesses any direct interest in the seal herd frequenting the Pribilof
                            Islands, but .that fact has not heretofore been regarded as a bar to
                            their admission to the conferences of the United States and Great
                            Britain when this herd was under consideration. His lordship will recall
                            the joint conference which took place in London between himself, the
                            American minister, and the Russian ambassador in 1888, and the
                            tripartite conference of the Secretary of State, the British and Russian
                            ministers in Washington in 1890. In inviting the October conference the
                            President felt that the controversy respecting the fur seals had been so
                            long and serious, and its rightful settlement so important and
                            far-reaching, it would be a great aid to the ultimate and proper
                            settlement of the long dispute if the United States and Great Britain
                            would avail themselves of the information and experience of the Russian
                            and Japanese Governments.</p>
                        <p>Having made such response as seemed necessary to your note of the 22d
                            ultimo, I have now to acknowledge the receipt yesterday afternoon of
                            your note bearing that date, in which you inform me that Mr. Hay made a
                            communication on the 27th ultimo to Her Majesty’s Government expressing
                            the desire of the Government of the United States for the admission of
                            delegates from Russia and Japan to the meeting of experts respecting the
                            fur-seal question; that you are instructed by Lord Salisbury to point
                            out that such a course would change the character and object of the
                            meeting of experts nominated by Great Britain, Canada, and the United
                            States; that it will not be possible for Her Majesty’s Government to
                            send a delegate to a meeting constituted in a manner suggested by Mr.
                            Hay on the 27th ultimo, and that your Government fails to perceive that
                            any useful purpose could be served by <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0343"/>the participation of Russia and Japan in a meeting to
                            consider the state of the Pribilof seal herd.</p>
                        <p>In response to these statements I beg to say that Mr. Hay has advised me
                            that under my instructions he called at the foreign office on the 23d
                            ultimo, and in the absence of the principal secretary for foreign
                            affairs he saw the permanent undersecretary for foreign affairs and
                            represented to him the earnest desire of the Government of the United
                            States that as early a date as possible should be fixed for the meeting
                            of the conference, which had been agreed upon for the month of October
                            between the British, Russian, Japanese, and American Governments. The
                            permanent undersecretary took note of Mr. Hay’s request and then stated
                            to him that the British Government had only consented to a meeting of
                            English, Canadian, and American experts. Mr. Hay expressed his surprise
                            at this; referred to his conversations with Lord Salisbury in which he
                            had expressly stated, without objection on the part of his lordship,
                            that Russia and Japan would be invited to take part in the conference,
                            and that in his note of July 29, in acknowledging receipt of his
                            lordship’s note of July 28, he had immediately called to his attention
                            the fact of the invitation having been extended to Russia and Japan,
                            without objection from the British Government. This interview having
                            been reported by telegraph to me, the views of the President on the
                            subject were communicated to Mr. Hay confirming his understanding of the
                            conference, and he was again instructed to urge an early answer to the
                            request to be informed when the British experts would arrive in
                            Washington. Under these circumstances Mr. Hay visited the foreign office
                            on the 27th ultimo, made known the views of this Government on the
                            question raised in the previous interview, and again asked to be
                            informed as to the arrival of the British representatives.</p>
                        <p>It will thus be seen that, so far from Mr. Hay having communicated “the
                            desire of the Government of the United, States for the admission of
                            delegates from Russia and Japan to assist at a meeting of experts,” his
                            object was to urge upon the British Government to indicate the time when
                            its delegates would arrive in Washington to attend the conference
                            already agreed upon and the composition of which had been early made
                            known to Lord Salisbury. No answer has yet been made to the inquiry
                            which was the object of Mr. Hay’s visits to the foreign office on the
                            23d and 27th ultimo, and which was likewise the subject of my note of
                            August 31 last. If, at the late date of Mr. Hay’s visit referred to, a
                            request had been made for the first time for the admission of delegates
                            from Russia and Japan to a meeting of experts from the United States and
                            Great Britain, his lordship might well claim “that such a course would
                            change the character and object of the meeting.” But it has been shown
                            that early in July last his attention was called to the character of the
                            conference solicited by the United States and was informed that Russia
                            had already accepted an invitation to participate in it and that Japan
                            was also expected to take part. It was likewise known to his lordship
                            that the Government of the United States had for three years past been
                            seeking to bring about such a conference, and not until Mr. Hay’s visit
                            on the 23d ultimo was this Government aware of any objection on the part
                            of the British Government to the participation of the representatives of
                            Russia and Japan in the conference which it had been agreed should be
                            held in October.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States having extended invitations to the
                            Governments of Russia and Japan to attend the conference, and both of
                            these Governments having accepted the invitation, this Government <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0344"/>will make the necessary
                            arrangements to receive their delegates and hold the conference during
                            the present month as agreed upon, and it anticipates that its
                            deliberations will be fruitful of good results.</p>
                        <p>It will be a source of deep regret to the President if the British
                            Government will not participate in this conference, but he directs me to
                            say to you that this Government will still hold itself ready to meet
                            during the present month by proper representation such delegates as the
                            British Government may nominate for the object set forth in Lord
                            Salisbury’s note of July 28 last. I have therefore to request that you
                            will communicate the fact of this readiness on the part of the President
                            to his lordship as promptly as possible, in order that, if agreeable to
                            him, the meeting may be fixed for a date as early in the month as
                            practicable.</p>

                            receipt of your note, No. 796, of the 7th instant, in reply to my two
                            notes of the 22d ultimo and the 6th instant, respecting the inability of
                            Her Majesty’s Government to accede to the proposal of the United States
                            for the admission of delegates from Russia and Japan to the meeting of
                            American, British, and Canadian experts to examine the condition of the
                            seals frequenting the Pribilof Islands.</p>
                        <p>I did not fail to convey by telegraph yesterday to Her Majesty’s
                            principal secretary of state for foreign affairs a summary of your note,
                            specially mentioning the readiness of the United States Government to
                            meet during the present month such delegates as Her Majesty’s Government
                            may nominate, for the object set forth in Lord Salisbury’s note of the
                            28th of July last to Mr. Hay, and I also transmitted a copy of the full
                            text by post last night.</p>
                        <p>As this, however, can scarcely be delivered in London before the end of

                            Her Majesty’s Government, I venture to point out that under the most
                            favorable circumstances it will be almost impossible for any British
                            delegate to arrive in Washington in time to attend a meeting before the
                            end of the present month.</p>

                            the 7th instant, I have the honor to inform you, in compliance with an
                            instruction received from the Marquis of Salisbury, that Her Majesty’s
                            Government have duly taken note of the acceptance by the President of
                            the United States of the proposal contained in his lordship’s note of
                            the 28th of July last, for a meeting of experts nominated by Great
                            Britain and Canada and by the United States. The object of this meeting,
                            as stated in the <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0345"/>above-mentioned note, is “to arrive, if possible, at correct
                            conclusions respecting the number, conditions, and habit of the seals
                            frequenting the Pribilof Islands at the present time, as compared with
                            the several seasons previous and subsequent to the Paris award.”</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s Government have accordingly nominated Prof. D’Arcy W.
                            Thompson as their delegate at the meeting in question, while the
                            Government of the Dominion of Canada have appointed Mr. Macoun in a
                            similar capacity, and those gentlemen have been instructed to proceed to
                            Washington with the least delay possible. Prof. D’Arcy Thompson sails
                            from Liverpool to-morrow, and may therefore be expected here on or after
                            the 23d instant.</p>

                            would be glad to be informed of the names of the experts to be appointed

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: An unavoidable delay has occurred in
                            replying to your notes of the 9th and 15th instant respecting a meeting
                            of experts of the United States, Great Britain, and Canada, owing to my
                            inability to communicate with the persons whom it was the desire of the
                            President to designate for that purpose. I now have the honor to inform
                            you that the delegates appointed to represent the Government of the
                            United States at the meeting of experts, as indicated in your note of
                            the 15th instant, are Messrs. Charles S. Hamlin and David Starr Jordan,
                            and that they will be ready to begin their sessions at such time as
                            shall be agreed upon after the arrival of the British delegates in this
                            city, having due regard for the convenience of the latter.</p>
                        <p>In view of the language employed in your two notes, of which this is an
                            acknowledgment, it seems necessary that I should add that no action on
                            the part of my Government can properly be construed into a proposal to
                            change the conditions established by the conferences held and the notes
                            exchanged between Her Majesty’s principal secretary for foreign affairs
                            and the United States ambassador in London in July last. But while the
                            President has been greatly desirous that the British Government should
                            participate in a conference where the whole subject of the controversy
                            might be considered, he welcomes any step taken in that direction,
                            however circumscribed. It is a source of gratification to him that the
                            meeting of American, British, and Canadian experts has been definitely
                            arranged, and he sincerely trusts it may lead to an early and honorable
                            adjustment of this long pending question.</p>

                            response to his representations Mr. Hay was informed that Professor
                            Thompson would leave immediately for Washington and that the Canadian
                            expert would join him there without delay.</p>
                        <p>Professor Thompson arrived on the 23d ultimo, and the experts nominated
                            by our Government signified to him their desire to enter upon their work
                            at once, but up to the present the meeting has been delayed on account
                            of the continued absence of Mr. Macoun, the Canadian expert. In view of
                            the past representations on the subject I need hardly say to you that
                            this delay has been a source of disappointment to the President. While I
                            am without any official information upon the subject, it is announced
                            from Ottawa in the public press that Mr. Macoun is not to leave the
                            Canadian capital till the 8th instant. If such is the case, I feel
                            called upon to express my regret, especially in view of the fact that,
                            under the limitations placed by Lord Salisbury upon the meeting agreed
                            upon between the two Governments, it is to be composed exclusively of
                            the experts named, and under the same limitations should naturally
                            precede any conference of a diplomatic or political character, which
                            latter is much desired and will be welcomed by my Government.</p>

                            been informed by the Marquis of Salisbury that Mr. Macoun proposes to
                            leave Ottawa to-morrow, Monday, on his way to Washington, and that the
                            Canadian Government, while fully recognizing the character and object of
                            the meeting of experts, desire that their minister of marine, Sir Louis
                            Davies, should be present, in order to watch the discussion and suggest
                            questions, if necessary, though naturally without obtruding any point of

                        <p>Sir W. Laurier proposes also to be in Washington, and I am desired by
                            Lord Salisbury to inform you of the wishes of the Canadian Government
                            and to inquire whether their proposal is agreeable to your

                            repeating the assurance which I gave you verbally yesterday when you
                            handed me your note of that date, that my Government will very heartily
                            welcome the visit to Washington of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the prime
                            minister of Canada, and Sir Louis Davies, minister of marine, and that
                            it cheerfully yields to the desire of the Marquis of Salisbury to so far
                            modify the character of the meeting of experts, as set forth in Mr.
                            Adam’s note of the 15th ultimo, as to admit the officials named as well
                            as yourself to the meeting, in order to watch the discussion and suggest
                            questions.</p>
                        <p>I beg to add that Mr. John W. Foster, whom, as you know, the President
                            has intrusted with the negotiations relative to the seal question, will
                            be expected also to attend the meetings on the part of the United

                            the meeting does not in any wise relieve the experts from the duty of
                            reaching conclusions on their own behalf respecting the conditions of
                            the Pribilof seal herd and making a report thereon. I am, etc.,</p>

                            conference with delegates of Great Britain and Canada held for the
                            following object: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            work of the conference. The protocols of this conference, which are
                            handed you herewith, contain the record of the daily proceedings of the
                            meetings. The final findings of fact are embodied in the joint statement
                            of conclusions unanimously adopted by the conference, which we now also
                            place in your hands.</p>
                        <p>It is proper that we should explain the absence in this joint statement
                            of all reference to the regulations adopted in accordance with the award
                            of the Paris Tribunal of Arbitration, or to any question involving
                            administrative action.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, in accordance with their understanding of the purpose
                            of the conference, the delegates of the United States presented for
                            discussion the following proposition: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    adopted by the Paris Tribunal of Arbitration have therefore
                                    proved ineffective for the protection and preservation of the

                                conclusions respecting the fur-seal herd frequenting the Pribilof

                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">joint statement</hi>.</p>
                            <p>1. There is adequate evidence that since the year 1884, and down to
                                the date of the inspection of the rookeries in 1897, the fur seal
                                herd of the Pribilof Islands, as measured on either of the hauling
                                grounds or breeding grounds, has declined in numbers at a rate
                                varying from year to year.</p>
                            <p>2. In the absence for the earlier years of actual counts of the

                            <p>The reduction between the years 1896 and 1897 in the number of
                                killable seals taken, while an indication of decrease in the
                                breeding herd, can not be taken as an actual measure of such
                                decrease. A number of other factors must be taken into
                                consideration, and the real measure of decrease must be sought in
                                more pertinent statistics drawn from the breeding rookeries
                                themselves.</p>
                            <p>3. From these data it is plain that the former yield of the hauling
                                grounds of the Pribilof Islands was from three to five times as
                                great as in the years 1896 and 1897, and the same diminution to
                                one-third or one fifth of the former product may be assumed when we
                                include also the results of hunting at sea.</p>
                            <p>4. The death rate among the young fur seals, especially among the
                                pups, is very great. While the loss among the pups prior to their
                                departure from the islands has been found in the last two years to
                                approach 20 per cent of the whole number born, and though the rate
                                of subsequent mortality is unknown, we may gather from the number
                                which return each year that from one-half to two thirds have
                                perished before the age of 3 years—that is to say, the killable age
                                for the males and the breeding age for the females.</p>

                                        this number is an underestimate, inasmuch as a greater
                                        number must have been overlooked than were counted twice. It
                                        is also recognized that the great majority of these pups

                                Paul and St. George was, in 1896 and 1897, between 160,000 and
                                130,000, more nearly approaching the higher figure in 1896 and the

                                    report, 1897. A correction to he made in the census of 1896
                                    arises from the agreed assumption that the total number of
                                    breeding females was 1.75 times the number seen in the height of
                                    the season. Later observations show that the actual total is at
                                    least twice the maximum number ever seen at once on a
                                    rookery.</note></p>
                            <p>7. On certain rookeries where pups were counted in both seasons,
                                16,241 being found in 1896 and 14,318 in 1897, or, applying a count
                                adopted by Professor Thompson, 14,743 in the latter year, there is
                                evident a decrease of 9 or 12 per cent within the twelvemonth in
                                question. The count of pups is the most trustworthy measure of
                                numerical variation in the herd. The counts of harems, and
                                especially of cows present, are much inferior in value. The latter
                                counts, however, point in the same direction. The harems on all the
                                rookeries were counted in both seasons. In 1896 there were 4,932, in
                                1897 there were 4,418, a decrease of 10.41 per cent. The cows
                                actually present on certain rookeries at the height of the season
                                were counted in both seasons. Where 10,198 were found in 1896, 7,307
                                were found in 1897, a decrease of 28.34 per cent.<note n="3" xml:id="d305fn3">The extreme irregularity of the number of cows
                                    present on the rookeries from day to day, and the consequent
                                    invalidity of and comparison of their number, is shown by the
                                    census made on Lukanin and Kitovi rookeries during the season of
                                    1897. See Appendix II.</note></p>
                            <p>8. It is not easy to apply the various counts in the form of a
                                general average to all the rookeries of the islands. We recognize
                                that a notable decrease has been suffered by the herd during the
                                twelvemonth 1896 to 1897, without attempting, save by setting the
                                above numbers on record, to ascribe to the decrease more precise
                                figures.</p>
                            <p>9. The methods of driving and killing practiced on the islands, as
                                they have come under our observation during the past two years, call
                                for no criticism or objection. An adequate supply of bulls is
                                present on the rookeries; the number of older bachelors rejected in
                                the drives during the period in question is such as to safeguard in
                                the immediate future a similarly adequate supply; the breeding
                                bulls, females, and pups on the breeding rookeries are not
                                disturbed; there is no evidence <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0351"/>or sign of impairment by driving of the virility of
                                males; the operations of driving and killing are conducted
                                skillfully and without inhumanity.</p>
                            <p>10. The pelagic industry is conducted in an orderly manner and in a
                                spirit of acquiescence in the limitations imposed by the law.</p>
                            <p>11. Pelagic sealing involves the killing of males and females alike,
                                without discrimination and in proportion as the two sexes coexist in
                                the sea. The reduction of males effected on the islands causes an
                                enhanced proportion of females to be found in the pelagic catch;
                                hence this proposition, if it vary from no other cause, varies at
                                least with the catch upon the islands. In 1895 Mr. A. B. Alexander,
                                on behalf of the Government of the United States, found 62.3 per
                                cent of females in the catch of the <hi rend="italic">Dora
                                    Siewerd</hi>, in Bering Sea, and in 1896 Mr. Andrew Halkett, on
                                behalf of the Canadian Government, found 84.2 in the catch of the
                                same schooner in the same sea. There are no doubt instances,
                                especially in the season of migration and on the course of the
                                migrating herds, of catches containing a very different proportion
                                of the two sexes.</p>
                            <p>12. The large proportion of females in the pelagic catch includes not
                                only adult females that are both nursing and pregnant, but also
                                young-seals that are not pregnant, and others that have not yet
                                brought forth young, with such also as have recently lost their
                                young through the various causes of natural mortality.<note n="1" xml:id="d305fn6">Statements on which to base an estimate of the

                            <p>13. The polygamous habit of the animal, coupled with an equal birth
                                rate of the two sexes, permits a large number of males to be removed
                                with impunity from the herd, while, as with other animals, any
                                similar abstraction of females checks or lessens the herd’s
                                increase; or, when carried further, brings about an actual
                                diminution of the here. It is equally plain that a certain number of
                                females may be killed without involving the actual diminution of the
                                herd, if the number killed do not exceed the annual increment of the
                                breeding herd, taking into consideration the annual losses by death
                                through old age and through incidents at sea.</p>
                            <p>14. While, whether from a consideration of the birth rate or from an
                                inspection of the visible effects, it is manifest that the take of
                                females in recent years has been so far in excess of the natural
                                increment as to lead to a reduction of the herd in the degree
                                related above, yet the ratio of the pelagic catch of one year to
                                that of the following has fallen off more rapidly than the ratio of
                                the breeding herd of one year to the breeding herd of the next.<note n="2" xml:id="d305fn7">The catch of the pelagic fleet, Canadian
                                    and American, in 1897, in Bering Sea was 16,657 seals. In the
                                    summer of 1896 it was 29,500. The aggregate catch which directly
                                    influenced the herd of 1897 was 38,922, a number made up by
                                    adding to the summer’s catch of 1896 the northwest coast catch
                                    in the spring of 1897. Up to the present time, accordingly, the
                                    pelagic catch already taken (16,657) and operating directly
                                    against next year’s supply is 57.22 per cent less than the
                                    pelagic catch which operated against the supply of 1897 (see
                                    also Appendix I); or, if we compare merely the summer catches,
                                    inasmuch as the possible spring catch of 1898 is an unknown
                                    factor, we have a reduction of 43.46 per cent.</note></p>
                            <p>15. In this greater reduction of the pelagic catch compared with the
                                gradual decrease of the herd there is a tendency toward equilibrium,
                                or a stage at which the numbers of the breeding herd would neither
                                increase nor decrease. In considering the probable size of the herd
                                in <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0352"/>the immediate future,
                                there remains to be estimated the additional factor of decline
                                resulting from reductions in the number of surviving pups caused by
                                the larger pelagic catch of 1894 and 1895.</p>
                            <p>16. The diminution of the herd is yet far from a stage which involves
                                or threatens the actual extermination of the species, so long as it
                                is protected in its haunts on land. It is not possible, during the
                                continuance of the conservative methods at present in force upon the
                                islands, with the further safeguard of the protected zone at sea,
                                that any pelagic killing should accomplish this final end. There is
                                evidence, however, that in its present condition the herd yields an
                                inconsiderable return either to the lessees of the islands or to the
                                owners of the pelagic fleet.</p>

                            the conference of the seal experts of the United States, Great Britain,
                            and Canada recently held in this city.</p>
                        <p>The results of the conference will be found in the “conclusions” on pages
                            15 to 19. You will observe that these “conclusions” substantially
                            confirm the facts contended for by the Government of the United States
                            since the regulations of the Paris Tribunal went into operation. It
                            therein appears that the seal herd of the Pribilof Islands shows a
                            decrease from year to year from 1884 (when the effects of pelagic
                            sealing first began to appear) up to 1897; that the herd has diminished
                            to <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0354"/>one-third (the British
                            concession) or one-fifth (the American contention) of its former size;
                            that a notable decrease has been suffered during the last year; that
                            this decrease has been brought about by the excessive killing of
                            females; that the proportion of females to males taken in pelagic
                            sealing is from 62 to 84 per cent; that while the herd is not threatened
                            with actual (biological) extermination so long as it is protected on the
                            islands, in its present reduced condition it is neither profitable to
                            the lessees nor the pelagic sealers—in other words, its commercial
                            extermination has been reached, that the method of killing on the
                            islands is fully approved, and that a large number of males may be taken
                            with impunity from the herd.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that, in
                            accordance with your instructions, I had an informal interview on the
                            16th ultimo with Sir Wilfrid Laurier, prime minister, and Sir Louis H.
                            Davies, minister of marine and fisheries, of the Dominion of Canada, who
                            were in Washington in attendance on the conference of fur-seal experts.
                            There was also present at the interview Mr. C. F. Frederick Adam, of the
                            British embassy.</p>
                        <p>The primary object of the interview was to agree, if possible, upon some
                            tentative method of settlement of the fur-seal question, with a view to
                            its formal consideration by the Governments of the United States and
                            Great Britain; but in the course of the interview various other
                            unsettled questions between the United States and Canada were discussed,
                            including the protection of fish in the waters of rivers and lakes
                            contiguous to the two countries, the alien labor law, the American
                            tariff on lumber and logs, commercial reciprocity, and the Northeast sea
                            fisheries. At the close of the interview I submitted a proposition as a
                            basis of settlement, of which I inclose a copy.</p>
                        <p>Sir Wilfrid Laurier said it would not be possible to give a definite
                            answer until he had taken the advice of his council, and that it would
                            be sent to me soon after his return to Ottawa. This answer was received
                            on the 30th uitimo and my response thereto was sent through the British
                            embassy on the 2d instant. The correspondence, of which copies are
                            inclosed, shows that the Canadian Government is unwilling to agree to a
                            modus vivendi suspending the killing of seals while the proposed
                            negotiations were in progress.</p>

                                        for consideration, with a view to settlement by means of

                                        of fish in the waters of rivers and lakes contiguous to the

                                colleagues.</p>
                            <p>Your second proposition practically embodies the suggestions made by
                                myself and my colleague, and meets, I need hardly say, with the full
                                approval of the Canadian Government. Though the regulations prepared
                                by the Paris Tribunal for the killing of seals in Bering Sea and in
                                the Pacific Ocean have been made revisable only at the end of five
                                years, we are quite willing to enter at once, and without waiting
                                for the end of the period thus fixed, into an agreement to review
                                the whole seal question, for the object of settling by treaty
                                stipulations, not that question alone, but all others in which at
                                present the relations between the two countries are not as
                                satisfactory as they ought to be, viz: “The protection of fish in
                                the waters of rivers and lakes contiguous to the United States and
                                Canada, the subject of reciprocal immigration, commercial
                                reciprocity, or any other unsettled question between the United
                                States and Canada which either Government may see proper to bring
                                forward.”</p>
                            <p>This proposition, however, is made by you contingent upon and subject
                                to the condition contained in the first: “That the Governments of
                                Great Britain and the United States agree at once to a modus vivendi
                                providing for a complete suspension of the killing of seals in all
                                the waters of the Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea for one year from
                                December, 1897, and for a suspension of all killing of seals on the
                                Pribilof Islands for the same period.”</p>
                            <p>There are difficulties in agreeing to that proposition which, I fear,
                                will be found insuperable.</p>
                            <p>Immediately on my return I requested my colleague, Sir Louis Davies,
                                to obtain information as to the number of sealers who are fitting
                                out for the coming year’s operations, and as to the approximate
                                compensation which would be expected to be paid to them in case
                                pelagic sealing was prohibited for a year. The information furnished
                                me is to the effect that the fleet is preparing as usual; that the
                                prohibition of pelagic sealing for a year would practically destroy
                                the business for several years, because the masters, the mates, and
                                the white crews, for the larger part belonging to other parts of
                                Canada, would leave British Columbia. The sum which would likely be
                                demanded as compensation is far beyond what it would be possible for
                                us to induce Parliament to <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0356"/>vote, even if we could recommend it. Under these circumstances,
                                and in view of the finding of the experts at the late conference,
                                that “In the greater reduction the pelagic catch” of late years
                                “compared with the gradual decrease of the herd, there is a tendency
                                toward equilibrium, or a stage at which the numbers of the breeding
                                herd would neither increase nor decrease,” and, further, that “the
                                diminution of the herd is yet far from a stage which involves or
                                threatens the actual extermination of the species, so long as it is
                                protected in its haunts on land.” I am in hopes that you will agree
                                to the proposition submitted at our verbal conference by Sir Louis
                                Davies and myself, and not press for the immediate suspension of
                                pelagic sealing.</p>
                            <p>The coast catch during the months of January, February, March, and
                                April, as gauged by the catches of the past few years, is very
                                small. Last year the catch of the Canadian sealing fleet amounted
                                only to 6,100, and in the year before to 8,350. If the fleet,
                                therefore, are permitted to prosecute pelagic sealing for these four
                                months, but little comparative harm would be done to the herd.
                                Following these months is the close season, embracing May, June, and
                                July, during which, of course, no pelagic sealing can be carried on,
                                except on the Asiatic coast. It appears to me, therefore, as highly
                                probable that the joint commission suggested could finally conclude
                                its labors long before the time when, under the Paris regulations,
                                pelagic sealing could begin in Bering Sea. If that commission
                                reached a satisfactory conclusion, and the Congress of the United
                                States approved of it, there would be no difficulty in obtaining the
                                necessary Imperial legislation to carry out whatever recommendations
                                might be agreed to with respect to the suspension or cessation of
                                pelagic sealing in time to prevent the prosecution of the business
                                in Bering Sea next year. It is obvious, however, that any conclusion
                                which might be reached by the joint commission must, to be
                                effective, be ratified by Congress as well as by Imperial
                                legislation, and unless, the session of Congress which opens in the
                                coming month of December and closes, I understand^ about the 4th of
                                March, ratifies any treaty which might be agreed to before its
                                termination, it would necessarily lie over for another year. This
                                would involve the renewal of the suspension for a second year, with
                                a further claim for compensation on the part of the sealers.</p>
                            <p>I would also the more strongly urge upon you the view here presented,
                                because pelagic sealing, being at present a legitimate business,
                                carried on under the sanction of the Paris regulations, can not be
                                stopped until the Imperial Parliament has enacted the necessary
                                legislation prohibiting it; and, as that Parliament will not meet
                                until early in February next, it seems obvious that such legislation
                                could not be hoped for until, at any rate, late in the month of
                                February. At that date the result of the labors of the joint
                                commission, if it was constituted at an early day, would be known
                                and could be submitted for approval at the coming session of
                                Congress.</p>
                            <p>Under all these circumstances, therefore, we do not see how it is
                                possible to agree to the suggested suspension, but we see no reason
                                to doubt, if the appointment of a joint commission results in the
                                submission of a treaty which Congress would ratify, the necessary
                                Imperial legislation could be procured in time to carry out its
                                recommendation with regard to Bering Sea sealing before the close
                                season ends and pelagic sealing begins, and so attain the object you
                                have in view.</p>
                            <p>Yours, respectfully,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir Wilfrid</hi>: I received on the 30th
                                ultimo, through the British embassy, your letter of the 24th, in
                                which you kindly communicate your answer to the proposition which I
                                submitted in the conference which I had the pleasure to hold with
                                you, your colleague, and Mr. Adam of the British embassy, on the
                                16th ultimo.</p>
                            <p>Your answer is in effect a declination of my proposition and a
                                renewal of the proposal made in the conference by Sir Louis Davies
                                and which at the time I stated my Government could not accept. The
                                considerations in support of your colleague’s proposal restated by
                                you have been submitted to the President, and he directs me to
                                express his regret that they are not of such a nature as to justify
                                him in reversing the position taken by me in our conference.</p>
                            <p>You intimate that if pelagic sealing is continued during the earlier
                                months of the year the catch would not exceed 6,000, which you think
                                would do little harm to the herd. This might be the case if it was
                                in its normal condition, but such a catch now would be approximately
                                equal to 30,000 in normal times, and in its present depleted
                                condition would create a serious inroad on the herd. The state of
                                “equilibrium” contemplated by the experts to which you refer was at
                                a still more depleted stage than even now exists. It is admitted
                                that the industry is at present unprofitable for both the lessees
                                and the pelagic sealers. Should the herd reach the “equilibrium”
                                pointed out by you it will have passed the period when negotiations
                                will be of any avail. But in addition to the injury that a
                                continuance of early pelagic sealing will do to the herd it will
                                also entail on the United States the heavy expense of the patrol
                                during the entire summer, even though a settlement should be
                                reached, as you think possible, before August, as the Victoria fleet
                                will be at sea, an expense which for the past four years has
                                averaged about $150,000 annually.</p>
                            <p>In view of your statement that the Imperial Parliament will not
                                convene till February, we should be quite willing to have the
                                proposed suspension of sealing take effect at such date in February
                                as would enable the necessary legislation to be passed provided a
                                modus vivendi could be signed at once. Such an arrangement would, it
                                is believed, obviate the legal difficulties to which you refer.
                                There is no disposition on our part to embarrass the Dominion
                                Government by asking impossible or unreasonable conditions. This is
                                the more apparent when I recall the fact that four years ago when
                                the Paris Tribunal rendered its award that body, “in view of the
                                critical condition” to which the herd was then reduced, recommended
                                the two Governments to suspend the killing of seals for a period of
                                two or three years. If such a measure was called for then, how much
                                more reasonable is the request for a single season’s suspension now,
                                after four more years of disastrous slaughter of female seals,
                                during which period the experts agree the herd has steadily
                                declined.</p>
                            <p>Your frank and courteous letter reveals the fact to which I had
                                occasion to refer during your recent friendly visit to this city,
                                and which constitutes a serious obstacle to our negotiations. We
                                seem to have failed to impress upon the Canadian Government, past or
                                present, our <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0358"/>view that
                                pelagic sealing ought to be voluntarily given up because it is
                                unneighborly in that it is destroying a valuable industry of our
                                Government, and inhumane because it is exterminating a noble race of
                                animals useful to the world. We paid Russia a large sum for Alaska
                                and the chief prospective return then visible was the seal industry,
                                which had yielded the Russian Government and subjects large profit.
                                We enjoyed the industry undisturbed for about fifteen years, reaping
                                a rich return to the Government and the lessees, the estimated
                                revenue to the Federal Treasury up to 1891 being over $11,000,000, a
                                sum much larger than was paid to Russia for the entire territory.
                                Suddenly the pelagic sealers entered upon the work of destruction
                                and they have brought the industry to the point when it is no longer
                                profitable.</p>
                            <p>This work of destruction has been prosecuted as a conceded legal
                                avocation, and when we have called attention to the rapid diminution
                                of the herd and the treaty obligation to protect and preserve it, we
                                have been met by the declaration that its actual extermination is
                                not immediately threatened. When it is proposed to negotiate for the
                                surrender of the legal right of pelagic sealing, we are told that
                                this can not be brought about by a fair compensation to those
                                engaged in the industry, but that the question must be included with
                                a number of other subjects having no relation to it whatever, and
                                that it must await the fate of all these matters, some of which, as
                                commercial reciprocity and the tariff, are very complex in their
                                character, and others, as the northeastern sea fisheries, of long
                                standing and very difficult of adjustment.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the President feels that the subject of the proper
                                protection of the seals should not be complicated with other
                                questions of intricate public policy and conflicting interests, in
                                his earnest desire to promote a more friendly state of relations
                                between the two neighboring countries he has consented that all
                                those questions should be embraced in one series of negotiations, if
                                meanwhile a modus vivendi could be agreed upon which would save the
                                seals from destruction while the negotiations were in progress. You
                                have been misinformed as to the duration of the coming Congresses it
                                will continue beyond the 4th of March next without constitutional
                                limitation. But it could hardly be anticipated that the subjects
                                which you desire to have considered would be adjusted by treaty
                                stipulations and the necessary resulting legislation with the
                                dispatch indicated in your letter, even with the most friendly
                                spirit of conciliation. The variety of questions to be considered
                                and the interests to be consulted would compel deliberation in the
                                negotiations and might create discussion before legislation could be
                                secured.</p>

                                President in adhering to the position which, under his instructions,
                                I assumed during our informal conference, because of my earnest wish
                                to have you understand that we are greatly desirous of bringing
                                about a better understanding with your Government. I am extremely
                                sorry and greatly disappointed that your visit to Washington gives
                                so little promise of satisfactory results, but I entertain the hope
                                that it may yet bear good fruits.</p>

                            a law enacted by the Congress of the United States and approved by the
                            President on Saturday, December 16, 1897, a copy of which is attached
                            hereto. You will observe that the purpose of this act is to appropriate
                            $200,000 to be expended (or so much thereof as may be necessary), in the
                            discretion and under the direction of the Secretary of War, for the
                            purchase of subsistence stores, supplies, and materials for the relief
                            of people who are in the Yukon country or other mining regions of
                            Alaska, and to purchase transportation and provide means for the
                            distribution of such stores and supplies.</p>
                        <p>I am advised by the honorable Secretary of War that in order to carry
                            into effect the provisions of this act it will be necessary to cross the
                            territory of the Canadian Government so as to reach the Yukon River
                            country with the stores, supplies, and materials of which tine people of
                            that region stand in great need. It is the purpose of the Secretary,
                            with the permission of the Canadian Government, to promptly proceed to
                            carry out the humane provisions of this act and to transport the
                            supplies, accompanied by military escort, over Canadian territory to the
                            Yukon River country and other mining regions of Alaska.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency will observe that the act also provides that, with the
                            consent of the Canadian Government, the Secretary of War may, in his
                            discretion, cause the relief thus provided to be extended in Canadian
                            territory. Permission for that purpose is also respectfully asked, and
                            for admission of supplies duty free to Canadian territory. As it is
                            necessary that the measures of relief contemplated shall be promptly
                            carried into effect, I have the honor to request the attention of your
                            excellency to the matter, in order that the train may be directed, if
                            the action of your Government shall warrant that course, to proceed with
                            the proper military escort over Canadian territory. As permission for
                            the passage of such escort is involved, and with a view to gaining time,
                            I beg that the inquiry may be made and the requisite permission be
                            obtained by telegraph.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: At the request of the Government of
                            Canada, I have the honor to ask for your good offices with your
                            honorable colleague, the Secretary of the Treasury, in order to obtain
                            permission for the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company to run a steamer
                            from Victoria, British Columbia, to Dyea, Alaska, for the purpose of
                            landing freight and passengers at that latter place, in transit for the
                            Canadian Northwest Territory.</p>
                        <p>The company propose that they should give a bond to the collector of
                            customs at Juneau, Alaska, and, if necessary, that a United States
                            officer, to be paid by the company, should accompany the goods until
                            they are within undisputed Canadian territory.</p>
                        <p>His Excellency the Governor-General of Canada has desired me to request
                            that the Treasury Department, if it agrees to the above proposals,
                            should send instructions by telegraph to the proper authorities, to go
                            forward by the steamer leaving Victoria, British Columbia, on the 28th
                            instant.</p>
                        <p>The matter is pressing, as the traffic to the Klondike gold fields, in
                            the Canadian Northwest Territory, is very heavy, and the season for
                            traveling in those regions will shortly close.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In view of the influx of large numbers of
                            persons into the Yukon district on both sides of the one hundred and
                            forty-first meridian, it would appear to be for the general interest
                            that the facilities for communication with the interior of the country
                            should be increased. Navigation by the Yukon is open only for about four
                            months out of the twelve, so that under present conditions the
                            population is left isolated for the rest of the year.</p>
                        <p>The Governments of the United States and of Canada propose sending into
                            their respective territories a military force to maintain law and <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0362"/>order; bat the opening up and
                            maintenance of communications with the interior districts during the
                            period when navigation ceases on the Yukon is an object of no less
                            importance and general interest.</p>
                        <p>It would therefore seem most desirable, pending the settlement of the
                            international boundary line between the United States and the Dominion
                            of Canada, south of Mount St. Elias, that, while reserving the rights of
                            either country, a permanent route should be created, giving access to
                            the interior at all seasons of the year.</p>
                        <p>Of such routes, that which appears to offer the fewest obstacles would
                            start from the head of the winter navigation on the Lynn Canal, crossing
                            the mountains by White Pass, or by any other pass which might prove more
                            easy of access, and proceeding northward to Fort Selkirk, and from
                            thence to Klondike.</p>
                        <p>Should the United States Government have no objection to the proposal,
                            the government of Canada is willing to undertake to open communication
                            by constructing a telegraph line from the head of winter navigation on
                            the Lynn Canal for a distance of about 80 miles across the summit of the
                            mountains, by whichever pass is found most practicable, to a suitable
                            point northeast of the mountain range, from which a trail can be readily
                            followed to Fort Selkirk and on to Klondike.</p>
                        <p>The Dominion government would likewise erect shelters at distances of
                            from 40 to 50 miles along the trail, and maintain dog trains during the
                            winter months for the conveyance of mails to and from the interior.
                            Travelers, on reaching Klondike, will find the surrounding country to be
                            accessible, and it is hoped that by this scheme more constant
                            intercourse with the interior can be established than by any other
                            plan.</p>
                        <p>The Governor-General of Canada has requested me to invite your most
                            favorable consideration to the above proposals, and his excellency would
                            be glad to learn at the earliest possible moment whether the Government
                            of the United States is prepared to concur therein; and, if not, in what
                            particulars they would wish to suggest any different arrangements.</p>
                        <p>I have further the honor to state that Her Majesty’s principal secretary
                            of state for foreign affairs, to whom the Canadian proposals were
                            submitted, indorses them, and has instructed me to urge upon the United
                            States Government the absolute necessity for adopting some measures of
                            similar import.</p>
                        <p>Of that necessity no further proof need be sought than the circular
                            issued yesterday by the United States Secretary of the Interior, warning
                            persons intending to cross the White Pass of the existing block at that
                            point.</p>

                            condescension to serve as arbiter between the Republics of Nicaragua and
                            Costa Rica, to decide upon the validity or invalidity of a treaty on
                            boundaries celebrated by them on the 15th of April, 1858.</p>
                        <p>His award put an end to the controversy, and both parties received and
                            acknowledged it with thankfulness. However, in carrying out some of its
                            details they encountered difficulties which, up to the present, have
                            impeded its complete execution. Said difficulties are mostly shown in
                            the original minutes of the commissioners charged with determining the
                            boundary line, and of their true nature I have endeavored to convey to
                            your excellency a clear idea in my official communication of the 26th of
                            December last, to which I take the liberty of respectfully calling your
                            excellency’s attention.</p>
                        <p>With a view to obviate them the two Republics agreed to a new convention,
                            which was by both of them duly ratified, the ratifications having been
                            exchanged, on the 18th of December last, by the Greater Republic of
                            Central America and that of Costa Rica, the former having at the time
                            taken the place of Nicaragua in respect to its foreign affairs.</p>
                        <p>By that convention,<note n="2" xml:id="d317fn2">For text of the
                                Convention, see <ref target="frus1896#pg_100">Foreign Relations,

                            inclose a certified copy, as also an English translation of the same,
                            two boards of engineers are provided for, one in behalf of each of the
                            contracting parties, to determine the dividing line between Nicaragua
                            and Costa Rica, said boards to be completed by an engineer appointed by
                            the President of the United States of America, and who shall have the
                            power—as ample as it is delicate—to finally decide upon all points of
                            difference, whatever their nature may be, between the two boards.</p>
                        <p>It is also stipulated by said convention that the diplomatic
                            representatives of both contracting parties shall, within ninety days
                            from the exchange of ratifications, request that the President of the
                            United States of America accede to make said appointment and select and
                            appoint said engineer.</p>
                        <p>In compliance with such stipulation I, in accord with his excellency the
                            minister resident of Costa Rica, under instructions and in behalf of our
                            respective Governments, apply through your excellency to the President
                            of the United States of America, requesting that he deign <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0365"/>to condescend to the wishes of said

                            receipt of your note of the 17th instant, in which, referring to our
                            conversation of the Kith, you state the desire of your Government to
                            transport troops and munitions of war from a port in Honduras, or from
                            the Confederation, to any port in the same State on the Atlantic or the
                            Pacific, with the object of reestablishing order along the Atlantic
                            coast, and that in the event of your Government being able to charter
                            American vessels for this purpose, it trusts that the consuls of the
                            United States at Ceiba and Trujillo, or at any other place along the
                            said coast, will put no obstacles in the way.</p>
                        <p>If, as would appear, the proposed chartering of American vessels by your
                            Government contemplates a regular contract with the owners or agents of
                            such vessels, not compulsory but voluntary on their part, it is not
                            perceived how the consuls of the United States could interpose any valid
                            objections to a legitimate transaction which the representatives of the
                            American owners may be legally competent to effect.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I inclose herewith for your information
                            copy of notes from and to Señor J. D. Rodriguez, the minister of the
                            Greater Republic of Central America at this capital, in regard to the
                            desire of his Government to charter American vessels for the purpose of
                            transporting troops and munitions of war with the object of
                            reestablishing order along the Atlantic coast.</p>
                        <p>You will observe the Department’s reply that if the proposed chartering
                            of American vessels by his Government contemplates a regular contract
                            with the owners or agents of such vessels, not compulsory but voluntary
                            on their part, it can not be perceived how the consuls of the United
                            States could interpose any objections to a legitimate transaction which
                            the representatives of the American owners may be legally competent to
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>If, however, there should be any appearance of coercion on the part of
                            the employing Government, the consul’s intervention would be justified.
                            The owners of the vessels should also understand that they can not
                            expect the United States to intervene in their behalf should the
                            employing Government fail to pay them for their services; for while the
                            United States would not interfere to prevent an American vessel from
                            voluntarily carrying arms and troops in the service of a Government
                            trying to put down an insurrection, it would leave the vessel and its
                            crews so voluntarily entering into such service to the consequences of
                            establishing such a relation. Should a seaman employed for other
                            services desire to be discharged, he ought not to be compelled to serve
                            in the transportation of arms and troops.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As the Department is aware, an exposition,
                            to be known as the Exposition of Central America, is to be held in the
                            city of Guatemala from March 15 to July 15, 1897. The people of
                            Guatemala, and, so far as they are able, of all Central America, are
                            bending every energy to make this exposition a success, and, judging
                            from all appearances at Guatemala, it promises to be so. Suitable and
                            handsome buildings have been bought from a recent exposition at
                            Bordeaux, France, and the buildings are being erected and the grounds
                            prepared under the supervision of the French engineers who constructed
                            the Bordeaux Exposition. The people of Guatemala and of Central America
                            are very solicitous regarding the success of this undertaking, and take
                            a great deal of pride in it.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances I take the liberty respectfully to recommend
                            that a United States ship of war be sent to the port of San Jose de
                            Guatemala, on the Pacific Ocean, to be present at the inauguration of
                            the exposition, and that, so far as feasible, provision be made for the
                            entertainment by the officer in command of the President and high
                            officers of Guatemala on this occasion. I am sure that it would create a
                            very pleasant feeling, not only in Guatemala, but in Central America;
                            and in a number of other respects also think the effect would be
                            salutary. I would recommend that as large and imposing a ship as
                            possible, if feasible the flagship, should be dispatched on this
                            mission.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: On the 9th of April last I had
                            the honor to address a note to your excellency informing you that on the
                            15th day of March next there will be opened in Guatemala City the first
                            Central American Exposition, which will include a “foreign department,”
                            and that my Government charged me to express to your excellency the
                            pleasure it would afford Guatemala to see exhibited in said “foreign
                            department” the works of art, products, etc., of the United States of
                            America.</p>
                        <p>Important manufacturing interests of this country have suggested the
                            propriety of placing the exhibits of the United States under the <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0368"/>superintendence of an official
                            commissioner to introduce and appropriately present at the Central
                            American Exposition the articles which to this end may be sent to him;
                            and my Government, which is ever ready to welcome every initiative
                            whatever that may contribute to mutual benefit and tend to draw closer
                            the relations between our two countries, instructs me to say to your
                            excellency that it would be pleased to see the appointment of such a
                            commissioner, who, on the other hand, would be cordially received and
                            waited on by the central committee of the Central American
                            Exposition.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report, in brief, the
                            visit to this capital of the commander in chief of the Pacific station
                            on the flagship <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia</hi> for the purpose of
                            attending the opening exercises of the Central American Exposition.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia</hi> arrived at the port of San Jose
                            on the evening of March 11, and the secretary of this legation was at
                            the port on her arrival to convey the respects of this legation.</p>
                        <p>The admiral and officers of his staff came to this capital by special
                            train on Saturday, the 13th instant, arriving here at 3.30 p.m. At
                            Moran, a station on the railroad about 10 miles out, they were met by
                            the president and central committee of the exposition, and by
                            representatives of the war and foreign offices. I personally met the
                            admiral at the railway station here and escorted him to his apartments
                            in the Gran Central Hotel.</p>
                        <p>As Monday, the 15th instant, was to be so much taken up by the inaugural
                            ceremonies of the exposition, it was found necessary that the official
                            call of the admiral upon the President of the Republic should be made on
                            Sunday. This was accordingly done at 11 a.m., of the 14th instant. The
                            call was paid at the executive mansion, the admiral being accompanied by
                            a large staff, and there were military honors and music by the Banda
                            Marcial. This call was duly returned by the deputy minister of war. On
                            this (Sunday) evening there was an exhibition at the Teatro Colon of a
                            literary and musical character by students of the <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0369"/>schools and others, in celebration of
                            the opening of the exposition. Two boxes were sent to this legation by
                            the Government for myself and the admiral and the officers of the <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia</hi>, and we duly attended the
                            exercises.</p>
                        <p>On the 15th instant, at 11 a.m., the admiral and staff, accompanied by
                            myself and the secretary of this legation, by invitation of the
                            President, called at the executive mansion, where we were received by
                            the President, members of the cabinet, and other high officials of
                            state. After a few moments the President and officials of Guatemala took
                            seats in their carriages to fall into the line of the procession to the
                            exposition grounds. The admiral in my carriage immediately succeeded the
                            carriage of the President, and we were immediately followed by the
                            admiral’s staff, and then by the battalion of the <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia</hi>, which had come up from the port by special train
                            the afternoon before. In this order we proceeded to the exposition
                            grounds. Arrived there, I escorted the admiral and staff to the tribune
                            occupied by President Barrios, where seats were reserved for them, and
                            thereafter I took my seat in the tribune of the diplomatic corps. The
                            literary exercises were then proceeded with, at the termination of which
                            a luncheon was served. President Barrios having expressed an earnest
                            desire to see the military and physical drill of the <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia’s</hi> battalion, a halt was made at a suitable ground
                            on the return march, and there the military and physical drill of the
                            battalion was given in view of the President and officials of Guatemala,
                            the entire diplomatic corps, and an immense throng of citizens. It was a
                            magnificent and stirring sight, and was received with much applause and
                            many expressions of admiration.</p>
                        <p>On the evening of the same day a serenade was given the President by the
                                <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia’s</hi> band, and on the next morning,
                            the 16th, the entire battalion returned to San Jose by special train. It
                            was a source of the greatest gratification to myself and all our
                            citizens here to witness the admirable behavior of the battalion, not
                            only when under arms, but off duty. On Sunday evening, the day of their
                            arrival, the commanding officer gave the men leave to go about the city
                            as they pleased, and everyone returned at the appointed time, not one of
                            them having misbehaved himself in any way. Admiral Beardslee requested
                            me to say a few words of farewell to the battalion on their departure;
                            and, while realizing and fully coinciding in the wisdom of the
                            disinclination of the Department to its diplomatic agents saying much in
                            public, I considered, in view of the splendid behavior of this battalion
                            here, it would not be considered improper for me to give some expression
                            to the feelings of appreciation which we all had of it. I therefore
                            consented, and beg to inclose herewith a copy of my remarks, as
                            published in The Journal, the only paper published here in the English
                            language (inclosed), and I trust the Department will not disapprove of
                            my action.</p>
                        <p>During the admiral’s stay he also paid official calls upon the diplomatic
                            corps, the members of the Guatemala cabinet, and upon the chief justice
                            of the supreme court, which calls were duly returned.</p>
                        <p>On the evening of the 17th instant, a dinner was given by the “American
                            colony” here.</p>
                        <p>On Thursday, the 18th instant, a breakfast was given to the admiral and
                            staff by Baron Werner von Bergen, dean of the diplomatic corps, and Mrs.
                            von Bergen, at which the diplomatic corps and the ladies of their
                            families were invited to meet the admiral.</p>
                        <p>On Thursday evening a reception and musicale was given to the admiral and
                            staff by President and Mrs. Barrios, at the executive mansion, <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0370"/>and on Friday morning, the 19th
                            instant, the admiral and officers returned by special train to San
                            Jose.</p>
                        <p>During the week Mrs. Coxe and myself had the pleasure of having Admiral
                            Beardslee and some of his officers with us, twice at dinner, once at the
                            opera, and once for an afternoon drive.</p>
                        <p>On Saturday the 20th instant a delightful reception was given by Admiral
                            Beardslee on board the <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia.</hi></p>
                        <p>It gives me much pleasure to assure the Department that I feel entirely
                            satisfied that this visit of the <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia</hi>
                            will have a very beneficial effect here in many ways. The officers by
                            their kindly and courteous demeanor and the men by their soldierly and
                            manly bearing have won the friendship and admiration of all; and in
                            every respect I feel sure that the advantage which I foresaw when
                            recommending that a ship be sent here at this time, as per my dispatch
                            of December 11, 1896, will be fully and entirely realized.</p>

                            informing me that the President had seen fit to withdraw the exequatur
                            of Mr. Florentin Souza, United States consular agent at Champerico.</p>
                        <p>I confess that I was somewhat surprised. I think that a more courteous
                            way of getting rid of a consular officer might have been employed. As to
                            what the charges against him are, up to the present time I have not the
                            slightest idea.</p>
                        <p>I will authorize Mr. S. F. Lord to act as consular agent for the
                            present.</p>
                        <p>I wired Mr. Souza, asking him if he knew why the action had been taken.
                            In his reply, which 1 received this morning, he states positively that
                            he knows no cause for such action, and requests that I will investigate
                                <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0371"/>the matter. I inclose
                            copies of all the correspondence, and will send copy of the minister’s
                            reply to my note as soon as received.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, I refrain from expressing any opinion until I am in possession
                            of all the facts.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor, etc.,</p>

                            dispatch No. 148, of the 31st ultimo, reporting that the Government of
                            Guatemala has revoked the exequatur of Mr. Florentin Souza, our consular
                            agent at Champerico, and that you have authorized Mr. Samuel F. Lord to
                            act as agent for the present.</p>
                        <p>Your selection of Mr. Lord as agent, ad interim, is approved by the
                            Department. The information respecting the acting agent, called for by
                            the Consular Regulations, should be sent by you to the Department in a
                            consular dispatch.</p>
                        <p>You inclose with your dispatch a copy of a note to the Guatemalan
                            minister for foreign affairs, in which you request a statement of the
                            reason for the withdrawal of the exequatur of Mr. Souza.</p>
                        <p>You were not strictly in your right in making this request. As a general
                            rule of international intercourse, a Government can withdraw a consular
                            exequatur without assigning any reason. If it voluntarily assigns cause
                            for removal, it invites discussion of the sufficiency thereof, and
                            defensive evidence can be offered with a request for reconsideration. If
                            it offers no reasons, it can not be compelled to give them, Your
                            inquiry, therefore, should be treated as a request for information
                            rather than as a demand for proof of good cause, and it is hoped the
                            Guatemalan Government will so construe it.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg leave to report to you that on the
                            28th of September, 1897, I issued a passport to Mr. Leon Aparicio.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the law, which requires all foreigners to be
                            registered as such, Mr. Aparicio applied to the minister of foreign
                            affairs for the usual certificate of registration, showing his passport
                            as proof of his citizenship.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Aparicio was refused the usual certificate on the ground that all
                            children born abroad of Guatemalan parents were citizens of the <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0373"/>Republic of Guatemala. Inasmuch
                            as Mr. Aparicio was born in France, and distinctly renounced his
                            allegiance to the French Government when the first passport was issued
                            to him by Minister Young, No. 249, on the 8th of January, 1895,
                            duplicate on file in the Department, I contend that the Government of
                            this Republic can not apply the article of their constitution, which
                            says, “that all children born abroad of Guatemalan parents are citizens
                            of Guatemala,” as above stated. I believe that I am in the right in my
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>I simply wrote to the minister and asked him his reasons, copy of which I
                            inclose; also copy of his answer, with translation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Aparicio’s second application was sent to the Department by way of
                            California on the 5th instant, with the returns for the quarter ending
                            September 30, 1897.</p>
                        <p>Requesting the Department to instruct me as to whether the position taken

                                note, dated the 1st instant, I have the honor to write to you giving
                                the information submitted by the subsecretary, which states: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: As it appears from
                                        what Leon Aparicio himself says, he was born in France in
                                        the year 1872, being a descendant of Guatemalan parents, and
                                        he afterwards became a citizen of the United States of
                                        America.</p>
                                    <p>With respect to his birth, we have to refer in this
                                        particular to the constitutional act which was in force at
                                        the time of the birth of Mr. Aparicio. The first act of the
                                        law says that the sons of Guatemalan parents are
                                        Guatemalans, although they may have been born in a foreign
                                        country; and by virtue of this Mr. Leon Aparicio is a
                                        Guatemalan, although he may have been born in France, and
                                        afterwards may have been naturalized in the United States.
                                        In this manner I have to comply with the wishes expressed in
                                        yours of the 2d instant.</p>
                                    <p>With assurances of my respect,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your No. 181 of the 7th ultimo has been
                            received and due consideration given to your reference to the Department
                            of the case of Mr. Leon Aparicio, who, although producing evidence of
                            citizenship in the form of a passport issued by you September 26, 1897,
                            has been denied Guatemalan registry as a foreigner on the ground that
                            all children born abroad of Guatemalan parents are citizens of the
                            Republic of Guatemala.</p>
                        <p>The Department fails to comprehend the application of the cited
                            Guatemalan law to the present case. Granting that Mr. Leon Aparicio may
                            have been born abroad of parents who, at the time of his birth, were
                            citizens of Guatemala, that circumstance would not prevent his becoming
                            a citizen of the United States by due process of naturalization,
                            precisely the same as if he had been born in Guatemala.</p>
                        <p>It appears from his sworn application of January 2, 1895, upon which your
                            legation issued a passport, No. 249, of the same date, that having been
                            so born in Paris, France, on the 28th February, 1868, he emigrated to
                            the United States in September, 1884; that he resided six years
                            uninterruptedly in the United States, from 1884 to 1890, at San Mateo,
                            Cal., and that he was naturalized as a citizen of the United States
                            before the superior court of San Francisco on the 25th day of August,
                            1890. He was then over 23 years of age, fully competent to become
                            naturalized in the United States according to the laws of this country,
                            and this Government must anticipate for him the same recognition of his
                            acquired status as it expects in the case of any other Guatemalan duly
                            naturalized in the United States.</p>
                        <p>As the reply of Señor Munoz rests apparently upon a misapprehension, you
                            should bring to his attention the facts as they appear, explaining to
                            him that your note of October 1 did not rest any ground of exemption on
                            the fact of Mr. Aparicio having been born in France, but solely on his
                            lawful acquisition of United States citizenship. It is unfortunate that
                            you should have put that point forward in your note, for by so doing you
                            afforded Senor Munoz reasonable ground to answer as he did.</p>
                        <p>It is further noticed that you state in your dispatch that Mr. Aparicio
                            “distinctly renounced his allegiance to the French Government when his
                            first passport was issued to him by Minister Young,” whereas in fact it
                            appears from the papers in the case that he renounced his original
                            allegiance when he was naturalized in California five years previous to
                            the date of his first application for a passport. It does not appear
                            that he renounced French allegiance on naturalization or that he ever
                            had any to renounce; but that is immaterial to the statement, inasmuch
                            as by no authority of statute or international law could he have
                            renounced any foreign allegiance before Minister Young. Such
                            renunciation is a part of the statutory process of naturalization, only
                            to be performed before a court within the jurisdiction of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully, yours,</p>

                                part of the Haitian officials; whether you were obliged to keep

                                to administer oaths by the laws of the place must be verified.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your No. 247, of April 2, 1897, has been
                            received. You inquire whether our consul general at Port-de Paix has the
                            right to administer oaths and take certain depositions requested in a
                            letter addressed to him by Mr. James L. Kelly, attorney for Mr. Lechner,
                            without special authorization from this Department. It appears from the
                            inclosure that Mr. Kelly, attorney for Mr. Lechner, desires to obtain
                            sworn testimony to be used in making a claim against the Government of
                            Haiti. The testimony, as the Department understands it, is not to be
                            used in the Haitian courts. If it were to be so used, it would be
                            necessary that it be taken in accordance with the requirements of the
                            Haitian law. You are referred to section 1750 of the Revised Statutes of
                            the United States, which you will find quoted in paragraph 845 of the
                            Consular Regulations, for the authority given every consular officer of
                            the United States to administer oaths and take depositions and to
                            perform any notarial act which a notary public is authorized to do in
                            the United States. By referring to section 1674 of the Revised Statutes,
                            quoted in paragraph 783 of the Consular Regulations, you will see that
                            the term “consular officer” includes consular agents. The consular
                            agent, therefore, has all the power to administer oaths which is given
                            by section 1750 to any consular officer of the United States. This
                            Department can give him no additional or special authority in such
                            matter. While the consular agent at Port de-Paix has the authority
                            within his territorial jurisdiction to take depositions in a matter of
                            this kind, which depositions would be unhesitatingly accepted by this
                            Department, it does not follow that he is obliged to abandon his public
                            duties and go about the country obtaining this evidence. This is a
                            matter which Mr. Kelly will have to settle with the agent; he has no
                            right to demand this service.</p>

                        <p>The body was taken from his late residence about 11 o’clock in the

                            were present, and everything possible was done to show the respect and

                            case of the persons charged with the murder of Charles W. Renton and
                            other crimes referred to in Mr. Mendoza’s note.</p>

                            two of the defendants. As the latter part of the telegram seems to me
                            blind, I send it herewith as received, together with a translation as it
                            reads, and also inclose a translation of the latter part as I suppose it
                            was intended to read, which would be accomplished by inserting, instead
                            of the words “se ha podido,” the words “se ha hecho lo posible.” Since
                            the receipt of this telegram I have made every possible effort to have
                            it repeated, so that I could get the correct reading before the next

                            <p>Having examined the case tried before the justice of the peace of
                                Yriona, in the inquiry into the crimes of illegal detention and
                                assassination committed on the person of Mr. Charles W. Renton, of
                                arson committed on the property of said Renton, and of injury of a
                                less grave nature inflicted on John Johnson, and of the forcible
                                removal of the wife of Mr. Renton, who was also wounded, to the cape
                                of Gracias a Dios:</p>
                            <p>Result: That the witness Zacarias Stephen declares that at the
                                beginning of the year 1894, he being in the house of Mr. Renton, saw
                                that there arrived Mr. Davve [probably should be Davve—Translator],
                                Fernando Eude, Kittle, and Johnson, all armed, and after a few words
                                of reconvention they discharged their rifles at Mr. Renton, who in
                                turn fired on them, but without anyone being wounded on this
                                occasion; that they having retired to the house of the company, Mr.
                                Davve gave to the deponent a letter and an order that he go and
                                bring Messrs. Sandham, Ysert, and Edgar Eude, who were in the “Cayo”
                                in order to kill Mr. Renton; that these immediately started for
                                “Brus Laguna” with the witness, and he retired to his house; that on
                                the following day he returned to the house of Renton, but did not
                                find the latter in it, but in that of Roberto, and with a wound
                                caused by a ball from a firearm which entered his body from behind,
                                through the short ribs, and then came out in front a little above
                                the belly; that Renton was lying on a bed, guarded by Mr. Davve,
                                Kittle, Fernando and Edgar Eude, Ysert, Sandham; and Kittle, Ysert,
                                Fernando and Edgar Eude set fire to the house which Mr. Renton had
                                in Brus Laguna, having previously removed all the furniture, boards,
                                wood roofing, cattle and deerskins, a stone for sharpening tools,
                                and all that could be utilized, and they took same to “Cayo,” where
                                many of these articles remain; everything else that they could not
                                take away they burned.</p>
                            <p>Result: That the witness Cuca declares that on the morning of one day
                                of the year 1894, she heard three shots of rifles, which were
                                discharged by Mr. J. Grosvenor Davve, Kittle, P. Johnson, Fernando,
                                Sandham, Edgar Eude, and Isaac (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>, probably
                                Ysert), from a mango tree which is in front of the house of Pascal
                                Ordonez, aimed at the house of Mr. Renton; that after the last
                                discharge the seven individuals entered the house of Mr. Renton,
                                from which they took as prisoners himself, Mrs. Renton, Alfonso
                                Lacayo, and an aged man, English or American, and also a little girl
                                that the said Mrs. Renton had; that of these five prisoners Mr.
                                Renton and Mrs. Renton were wounded, the former beside the left teat
                                and the latter on the back of the left hand; that Renton, his wife,
                                the little girl, and Lacayo, were led to the house of Ysist Cruz,
                                there remaining as guards at the door of said house, with their
                                rifles, Kittle, Sandham, Fernando, and Johnson, Mr. Davve, Isaac,
                                and Eude, having entered together with the said prisoners; that
                                about 12 o’clock in the day Davve and Isaac went to “Cayo,” taking
                                with them the Englishman whom they took with Renton, and the others
                                remained at their posts; that at 6 o’clock in the evening Edgar Eude
                                led Mrs. Renton out in order to embark her, together with the little
                                girl and Alfonso Lacayo, taking with them as seamen Tinglas, Damaso,
                                Robert, and Williams, and all of these embarked, going in the
                                direction of “Patuca,” Mrs. Renton having been compelled to do so by
                                force, Messrs. Fernando, Kittle, Sandham, and Johnson having
                                remained behind to guard Mr. Renton; that with regard to his wife,
                                she learned from Tinglas that she had arrived at Patuca about 2
                                o’clock in the morning, and that the witness saw from her house that
                                from the residence of Mr. Renton there issued smoke on all sides,
                                but did not know who set it on fire.</p>
                            <p>Result: That the declaration of the witnesses Roberto, Maria W.
                                Valeroso, Lucrica Mayren and others were taken, as well as the
                                examinations of the individuals Davve, Ysert, Sandham, and Edgar
                                Eude.</p>
                            <p>Result: That the experts Luis Refsman and Vertin Canales, in virtue
                                of the declarations taken at the initial proceedings, asserted that
                                the wound of Mr. Charles W. Renton, in accordance with the
                                indications as to its location, and the weapon used in inflicting
                                it, is believed by them to be dangerous, without being able to
                                determine whether or not same would cause his death, or within what
                                time he would have recovered; that with regard to the wound suffered
                                by Mr. John Johnson, they did not believe it dangerous, and that it
                                could be cured in thirty days, leaving a cicatrice; and they
                                supposed that that of Mrs. Renton was slight and they believed she
                                would recover from it in eight or ten days, adding that the wound of
                                Mr. Renton not being mortal, he should recover from it within thirty
                                days under medical treatment.</p>
                            <p>Result: That the experts Gregorio Torres and William Webb estimated
                                the value of the following articles: The house of Mr. Renton at
                                $1,700; pasture land, partly wire fenced and the remainder with
                                natural fence, at $2,000; a cocoa plantation, containing 1,820
                                trees, in poor condition; at $3,000; 2 saddle mules at $200; an iron
                                    <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0383"/>stove at $32; a sewing
                                machine at $35; 4 boxes lined with zinc, 2 large and the other 2
                                small, at $20 the former, and $12 the latter; 4 chairs at $12; 2
                                Winchester rifles at $80, and 1 double-barreled gun at $22; 1
                                grindstone at $8, and 3 dogs at $20; the sum total being $5,471.</p>
                            <p>Result: That the investigation having been closed the judge, under
                                date of the 2d of June, 1895, decreed sentence of imprisonment on
                                Arturo Ysert, Grosvenor Davve, A. J. Sandham, J. J. Kittle, Phillips
                                Johnson, and Fernando and Edgar Eude for the crime of assassination
                                committed on the person of Mr. Charles W. Renton; for setting fire
                                to his house, which is situated on the outskirts of the village of
                                Brus Laguna; for the wounds inflicted on John Johnson, and with the
                                exception of Mr. Davve, for the offenses of illegal detention and
                                forcible removal of the person of Mrs. Renton from this territory to
                                that of Nicaragua.</p>
                            <p>Result: That the case having been carried to the court of the
                                district of Trujillo it was set down for a full hearing, and after
                                receiving all the evidence offered by the defense it was submitted
                                to the jury, which declared proved the following facts: <list>

                                condemning Jesse Kittle and Arthur Sandham for the crime of illegal

                                Davve and Edgar Eude, as well as Ysert, for the offense mentioned to

                                        because in the suit there are not recorded all the

                                        attempted homicide, and consequently the crime is not
                                        proved, because it is clear that the nature of Mr. Renton’s

                                        of a house after a lapse of much time, and they said nothing
                                        as to whether the burning occurred through fraud, through
                                        the negligence of some person, or by accident, judging from

                                        to which is added that the jury declared as authors of the
                                        burning the accused, basing its finding on the evidence of a
                                        witness who contradicted himself, which constitutes a

                                        of in article 47 of the jury law, for which reason the

                                        verdict of the jury should be declared void, on account of
                                        being contradictory in so far as the illegal detention of
                                        Renton in the house of Ysis Cruz, after being wounded, is
                                        concerned, it being declared at the same time that all the
                                        parties prosecuted were the authors of the burning, which,
                                        according to the sentence, occurred during the detention of
                                        Mr. Renton, and it is not possible for both deeds to have
                                        taken place simultaneously; this apart from the fact that
                                        the verdict is null also, because it has for a basis for

                                        witness which is void in substance, as demonstrated by the
                                        fact that Gregorio Torres de Manto, after having testified
                                        against the accused, acted as interpreter or translator of
                                        the declarations of the sambos Roberto, Cuca, Soris, and
                                        Valerosa, contrary to what is prescribed by article 315 of

                                        circumstance that the simple sambo witnesses deserve little

                                only in the cases clearly determined by the letter of the law,
                                because the law does not in fact demand an account of the judges of
                                the means by which they arrived at a conviction, nor does it
                                prescribe rules for deducing the fullness and sufficiency of proof,

                            <p>Considering, that the judgment in question has been dictated in
                                accordance with the merits of the case in respect to the illegal
                                detention, notwithstanding what may be alleged regarding the nullity
                                of the verdict of the jury, because to this point are applicable the
                                same reasons expressed in the final part of the preceding paragraph,
                                and, therefore, article 150 of the Code of Procedure has not been
                                violated;</p>
                            <p>Considering that neither has article 134 of the political
                                constitution been violated, because with the certification of the
                                corresponding judgment it has not been proven that the initiatory
                                proceedings, that might have remained closed, by being without
                                result, were set aside in order to make inquiry into the same deeds
                                to which this judgment refers;</p>
                            <p>Considering that the fact that the court of appeals overlooked the
                                recommendation of commutation solicited in favor of the criminals
                                Davve, Eude, and Ysert does not constitute the violation of the
                                legislative decree of the 6th of April, 1896, because the
                                disposition relative to that recommendation is within the power of
                                the tribunal:</p>
                            <p>Therefore, the supreme court of justice, by a unanimous vote, and
                                complying with articles 737,738, 839,750,754, 760, and 762 of the
                                code of procedure, declares inadmissible the appeal as based upon
                                article 397 of the penal code, and there is no cause for appeal in
                                respect to the remaining alleged infractions, and it decrees payment
                                of the costs by the petitioner and the return of the antecedents to
                                the tribunal whence they proceeded, with the respective
                                certification.</p>
                            <p>Let it be communicated.</p>

                            Renton, and to Mr. Little’s telegram, therein transmitted, announcing
                            the escape of the defendants Isert and Sandham, the latter part of which
                            telegram was blind, I beg to report that I have only to-day succeeded in
                            obtaining the true reading. My efforts to this end through the telegraph
                            offices were entirely without result, the repetition of the telegram
                            handed me being precisely in the same words as the original.</p>
                        <p>I am to-day in receipt of a telegram from Mr. Little, in reply to my
                            letter of April 4, inquiring on the subject, that the telegram was sent
                            wrong, in that the word “no” should have been inserted before the words
                            “se ha podido,” indicating that it had not been possible to recapture
                            the prisoners.</p>
                        <p>I have no doubt at all that Mr. Little’s telegram was sent immediately
                            upon the receipt of my letter of April 4. This transaction will give the
                            Department a slight indication of the unreliability of the telegraphic
                            system and the length of time it takes to communicate in these
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Little further informs me that the foreign minister of Honduras

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your instruction, No. 14, of
                            date July 7, 1897, which inclosed copies of letters from the Ansonia
                            Clock Company of New York, and directed me to look into their complaint
                            that the Italian minister of commerce refused to admit their clocks into
                            Italy as clocks fitted up with “American movements,” thus preventing the
                            continuation of their business with this country, also to present the
                            matter to the attention of the Italian Government, and to do all I could
                            to remove the impression that the works manufactured by this company
                            were not “American movements,” and referring to my dispatch No. 25, of
                            date July 27 last, I now have to say:</p>
                        <p>It seemed wise, in my judgment, before approaching the Italian Government
                            with a complaint, to learn privately and exactly what their attitude was
                            toward the importation of clocks generally and toward those having
                            American movements in particular, and Mr. Hector de Castro, consul
                            general of the United States at Rome, kindly undertook to make the
                            necessary inquiries at the Italian custom-house department and
                            elsewhere, if it seemed desirable. The result of Mr. de Castro’s
                            investigations will be read in detail in the inclosures herewith. I take
                            this opportunity to express my high appreciation of the thoroughness
                            with which the consul-general conducted his examination.</p>
                        <p>It seems certain that the trouble is largely due to the fact that the
                            term “American system” (<hi rend="italic">sistema Americano</hi>) was
                            not closely enough defined when the commercial treaty with Austria
                            Hungary and with Germany was made, for, as I understand the
                            complication, it is through the clauses of this treaty, in connection
                            with the favored-nation clause in our own commercial treaties with
                            Italy, that the Ansonia Clock Company looks for different treatment from
                            what it has been receiving. American manufacturers mean one thing by the
                            term “American movement” or “American system,” while the Italian
                            authorities mean another. What <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0390"/>the Italian authorities regard as the American system is limited to
                            .one specimen of the cheap, round, nickel-plate American clock with an
                            alarm bell on top, which was exhibited and examined, as they say, when
                            the treaty was under consideration; and they have ruled that nothing but
                            that one kind of clock shall come into the Kingdom under the treaty. It
                            simply must look like the picture in the official circular, as will be
                            seen in inclosure No. IV. The quality of the works, the quality of the
                            casing had nothing to do with it. Clocks which look like the one that
                            they had seen when the treaty was signed are to them the entire American
                            system, and nothing else can be imported that looks different, no matter
                            whether it was made in America or was better or worse in any or every
                            respect. The collector-general says frankly that the only reason why the
                            Italian authorities agreed to allow the clocks to come in at all at the
                            reduced rate (namely, 1.56 lire per kilo on the weight instead of 5 lire
                            on each clock and 1.50 lire per kilo of weight in addition) was because
                            they knew that the number must be limited. To give anything but a narrow
                            construction to the clause of the treaty would have been to throw open
                            the Italian market to large importations of clocks of different outside
                            appearance. Naturally enough, perhaps, they do not mean to allow that.
                            Their present position may be an afterthought based upon a technicality
                            of appearance, but there is no doubt about their position.</p>
                        <p>If you have any further instructions in the matter I shall be glad to
                            receive them. I may add that I have to-day written to the Ansonia Clock
                            Company, telling them that I had reported to the Department of State in

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As agreed upon in our conversation of
                                a few days since, I take the liberty of submitting to you a few
                                remarks on the subject of the application of the Italian tariff to
                                “clocks, so called, of American system.”</p>
                            <p>Among the sample clocks the embassy now holds you will find two round
                                clocks, the Spark and the Bee Alarm, which the Italian ministry of
                                finance considers as clocks so called of American system because
                                they are inclosed in cylindrical cases. Besides these you will find
                                two other clocks, the Midge and the Pert Gem, which, <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0391"/>owing to the fact of their being
                                inclosed in rectangular casings, are not considered as “American
                                clocks;” consequently, instead of paying 1.50 lire per kilo, as is
                                the case with the Spark and the Bee Alarm (when accompanied by
                                certificate of origin), they are made to pay 5 lire apiece plus 1.50
                                lire per kilo for the casing.</p>
                            <p>The Italian Government, in its ill-defined tariff, makes a special
                                item of “American clocks,” but instead of distinguishing the clocks
                                by the “works,” it applies its tariff according to the casing; so
                                that, provided a clock is inclosed in a cylindrical case (like the
                                Spark and the Bee Alarm), no matter whether the “works” be of the
                                finest workmanship, it is-considered as an “American clock” and
                                taxed accordingly. On the other hand, if the works of a “clock, so
                                called, of American system” are inclosed in a case of any shape
                                (like the Midge and the Pert Gem), they are taxed at the rate of 5
                                lire apiece for the works plus 1.50 lire per kilo for casing.</p>
                            <p>Hoping you will forgive my having entered into so many details, and
                                that yon will succeed in obtaining from the ministry of finance of
                                Italy its consideration of the matter,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of and to thank you for your letter of the 2d instant,
                                inclosing a copy of the circular published by your office on May 30,
                                1892, relating to “clocks, so called, of American system.”</p>
                            <p>I beg that you will allow me to return to the same subject to ask you
                                what would be the tax on the same “clockworks” if, instead of being
                                inclosed in the cylindrical case, as shown by the illustration in
                                the aforesaid circular, they were inclosed in a case of different
                                shape and more expensive, though they were manufactured in America,
                                and their origin were proved to the satisfaction of the honorable
                                collector-general’s office.</p>
                            <p>I have been requested to clear this point by American manufacturers
                                who claim that if the clocks are not inclosed in a case similar in
                                shape to that of which a drawing is in margin of the above-quoted
                                circular, they were taxed at the rate of 5 lire apiece for the clock
                                work plus 1.50 lire per quintal for the casing, although the clock
                                work was identical to that of the “clocks, so called, of American
                                system.”</p>
                            <p>I should feel much obliged if you would kindly make clear to me this
                                point, which is of the utmost importance to one of our chief

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In your esteemed letter of the 8th
                                instant you inquired as to this ministry’s interpretation of the
                                regulations of the commercial treaties with Austria-Hungary and
                                Germany relating to “clocks, so called, of American system.”</p>
                            <p>In reply I beg to state as follows:</p>
                            <p>The general customs tariff (No. 251, letter A–2) fixes the duty on
                                clocks at 5 lire apiece plus the duty on the casing.</p>
                            <p>A favor treaty was established with Austria-Hungary and Germany for
                                clocks, so called, of “American system;” but in establishing this
                                favor treatment it was intended that it should apply only to the
                                ordinary alarm clocks with plain casing of sheet nickel-plated metal
                                of the pattern a drawing of which illustrated the circular I had the
                                pleasure of transmitting to you. It was in consideration of the
                                limited extension of this concession that it was agreed in the
                                treaties to collect a duty of 1.50 lire per quintal on clocks of
                                said species, casing included, thus renouncing to the provisions of
                                the general tariff, according to which an extra duty is collected on
                                the casing.</p>
                            <p>You will easily understand that in granting this exemption from tax
                                on the casing it was intended that this favor treatment should apply
                                only to clocks the casing of which corresponds to that of the clocks
                                produced as samples and examined during the course of the commercial
                                conference. All controversies arising on the subject have been
                                settled on this principle, and all clocks were excluded from favor
                                treatment which, although having the clock work of so-called
                                “American system,” were inclosed in casings of material and shape
                                different from that of the alarm clocks of the pattern described in
                                the above quoted circular.</p>
                            <p>Trusting that I have satisfactorily replied to your inquiry, I am,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: In further reply to your note of
                            the 22d ultimo, inclosing copy of the decree of the minister of
                            agriculture, industry, and commerce, regulating the importation into
                            Italy by sea of cattle, hides, skins, pork, etc., I have the honor to
                            state that I have received a letter from the Secretary of Agriculture
                            giving his views on the subject.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wilson calls attention to the fact that, according to articles of the
                            decree, meats from the United States must be accompanied by a sanitary
                            certificate of origin issued by the competent local authorities and
                            viséed by the Italian consul or consular officer residing or having
                            jurisdiction in the place where the meat is shipped. In the case of most
                            of the European countries the certificates of the local authorities
                            suffice, without the necessity of the consular visé.</p>
                        <p>The reason for the discrimination against the United States is not
                            apparent, and it may be the cause of much inconvenience and loss to our
                            exporters. The inspection of meats in this country is a Federal
                            inspection, and the certificates are issued by the Government as a
                            guaranty that the animals were free from disease at the time of
                            slaughter and that the meats are sound and wholesome. Mr. Wilson states
                            that he is not aware that the general government of any other country
                            has established an inspection of meats and provided for a government
                            certificate to accompany them when exported to other nations; but
                            whether this be so or not, it is certain that this Government has done
                            everything in its power to meet the objections raised against its meat
                            products, and there can be no reasonable ground for the least
                            discrimination against this class of exports by any country.</p>

                            cattle, hides, skins, pork, etc.</p>
                        <p>As you will preceive from the correspondence, the decree appears, in
                            respect to the necessity of a consular visé, to discriminate against the
                            United States as compared with some of the European nations.</p>
                        <p>You will use every effort with the Government of Italy to accomplish the
                            removal of this discrimination.</p>

                            the minister of foreign affairs on the subject, urging the removal of

                            use his offices with his colleague for such a solution as might seem

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In January last, an Italian sanitary
                            decree was issued relative to the importation into Italy of meats, etc.,
                            in which it was provided that in the case of shipments of meats from the
                            United States our certificates of origin must be accompanied by an
                            Italian consular visé. In the case of most of the European countries no
                            consular visé was required.</p>
                        <p>At the suggestion of the Secretary of Agriculture the attention of the
                            Italian Government was called to the discrimination, both through your
                            embassy and through the Italian embassy at this capital.</p>
                        <p>I inclose copy of Baron Fava’s note of the 26th ultimo, in which it is
                            frankly stated that his Government can not be expected to modify the the
                            discrimination above referred to, unless more satisfactory rates are
                            accorded by the pending tariff bill to certain Italian products.</p>
                        <p>As the Secretary of Agriculture points out in his letter of the 14th
                            instant (copy inclosed), the position of the Italian Government is not
                            logical. No discrimination is enforced by the pending tariff bill. Its
                            rates, deemed necessary for the purpose of collecting a revenue, apply
                            uniformly to the products of all countries. The Italian decree
                            discriminates against a country which has taken especial precautions to
                            insure the healthfulness of its meat exports.</p>
                        <p>I inclose for your information, and to aid you in the representations
                            which it is desired you shall make to the Government of Italy, copy of
                            Department’s instruction No. 2, of the 5th instant, to our minister to
                            Belgium, setting forth the view which the Government of the United
                            States entertains in regard to the matter.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to state
                                that I am instructed by my Government to address you upon a subject
                                concerning which there has been some correspondence previous to my
                                arrival in Rome.</p>
                            <p>I am informed that on January 26 last a decree was issued by the
                                royal ministry of agriculture, industry, and commerce providing for
                                the regulation of the importation into Italy by sea of cattle,
                                meats, etc.</p>
                            <p>In the third section of the decree it appears that meats from the
                                United States must not only be accompanied by a sanitary certificate
                                of origin issued by the competent local authorities, but the
                                certificate must be viséed by the Royal consul or consular officer
                                having jurisdiction in the place from which the meat is shipped.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, for meats from the European countries named in
                                this section, the certificates issued by the local authorities are
                                made valid without the necessity of the consular visé.</p>
                            <p>On April 1 last Mr. Larz Anderson, chargé d’affaires, addressed to
                                your excellency a note on the subject of this discrimination in
                                accordance with instructions received by him from the State
                                Department at Washington.</p>
                            <p>I find an acknowledgment of this note on the files of the embassy <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0398"/>under date of April 7 last,
                                but no further reply. If one was sent I would be greatly obliged for
                                a copy.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Anderson’s departure and the illness of his successor, Mr. Hale,
                                during the month before my arrival may have interfered with the
                                continuity of the negotiation, especially since I have only just
                                been informed that the question was pending.</p>
                            <p>I now hear from my Government that the attention of the embassy of
                                His Majesty the King of Italy at Washington was called to this
                                discrimination some months since, and that under date of May 26,
                                1897, His Excellency Baron Fava notified the Department of State
                                that the question would be submitted for examination to the
                                zootechnic epizootic board at one of its next sessions.</p>
                            <p>This note is said, moreover, to make the following statements: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>His Majesty’s Government, however, desires to perform a

                                representations to your excellency on the subject, I would be glad
                                of a reply covering Mr. Anderson’s note and this one.</p>

                            affairs, in which I am informed that the minister of agriculture and
                            commerce submitted to the zootechnic council, as he had said he would,
                            the request formulated by the Government of the United States to the end
                            that the requirement of the consular visé should be abolished, and that
                            the council had expressed an opinion favorable to such abolition. Also,
                            that in consequence of this opinion the minister of agriculture and
                            commerce had advised him (the minister of foreign affairs) that he would

                            the subject of the requirement of the Italian Government that an Italian
                            consular visé must be affixed to certificates of origin accompanying our
                            exports of meats to Italy, and particularly to my dispatch No. 42, of
                            September 10, 1897, in which I reported that the minister of commerce
                            had informed the foreign office that he would very shortly provide for a
                            modification of article 3 of the decree of January 26, 1897 (article 3
                            being the one requiring the consular visé), in conformity with the
                            request of the United States, and to your instruction No. 52, of October
                            6, 1897, in which you said you would be glad to receive any further
                            information in regard to the matter, I have now the honor to report
                            that, three months having elapsed without further formal communication
                            on the subject from the foreign office, I took occasion yesterday to
                            write to the minister for foreign affairs to ask when or about when the
                            promised modification might be expected.</p>
                        <p>This morning I received a note from the minister for foreign affairs in
                            which he says that, according to assurances received from the Royal
                            ministry of commerce, article 3 of the decree of January 26, 1897, will
                            without fail be modified in order to abolish the obligation of the
                            consular visé upon the certificate in question, and that the
                            modification will doubtless be made before the end of the current year.
                            For your complete information I inclose copies of the correspondence,
                            accompanied by a translation of the minister’s note.</p>
                        <p>In view of these assurances it seems to me that there can be no doubt
                            that the result sought by our Government in the matter will be
                            attained.</p>

                    <p rend="center">[Handed to the Secretary of State by the Japanese minister
                        March 18, 1897.]</p>
                    <p>Japanese subjects residing and doing business at Butte, Mont., have presented
                        a petition to the Japanese consul at New York, wherein they complain of
                        interference with their business, in some cases amounting to actual
                        violence, by members of a local labor organization. It appears that the
                        Silver Bow Trades and Labor Assembly, Knights of Labor, have declared a
                        general boycott in the following terms, as published in the Daily
                        Inter-Mountain, Butte, Mont., on the 12th of January, 1897: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            <p>A general boycott has been declared upon all Chinese and Japanese
                                restaurants, tailor shops, and wash houses by the Silver Bow Trades
                                and Labor Assembly. All friends and sympathizers of organized labor
                                will assist us in this fight against the lowering Asiatic standards

                                races, and further invasions of industry and further reductions of
                                the wages of native labor by the employment of these people must be
                                strenuously resisted.</p>

                    <p>This boycott, it would seem, is not only directed against Japanese engaged in
                        the occupations above enumerated, but against all Japanese however employed,
                        and incidentally against all persons employing Japanese in any capacity who
                        refuse to discharge them in compliance with the wishes of the labor
                        assembly. As reported in the Butte Times of January 30 last, the boycott
                        committee state it is their intention to boycott all such persons, to injure
                        their business as much as possible, so that they may be forced to obey the
                        committee’s commands. Their object, they say, is to force every Chinese and
                        Japanese in Butte to leave the town. This object they appear to be
                        vigorously pursuing, going, in some instances, as alleged in the petition
                        from the Japanese residing in Butte, to the extent of willfully destroying
                        the property and threatening the bodily safety of the persons against whom
                        their hostility is directed.</p>
                    <p>So far as is known, neither the State nor the local authorities have taken
                        any steps to prevent these violations of the rights of peaceful and
                        unoffending Japanese within their jurisdiction.</p>

                            the Western States and Territories, I have the honor to inform you that
                            the Attorney-General, of whom I requested an opinion whether any act of
                            Congress protects citizens of other countries in such employment and
                            whether there is any remedy for the boycott complained of by you,
                            advises me, under date of the 27th instant, that there is no statute of
                            the United States which makes the acts you describe a criminal offense
                            against the United States, and that redress for the legislation or acts
                            complained of, if there is any, of which he expresses no opinion, is by

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have been informed by Count Okuma that
                            during the present session of the Diet a Government coinage bill will be
                            presented for the consideration of that body which will, if passed,
                            change the standard of value in Japan from silver to gold.</p>
                        <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0403"/>
                        <p>It is proposed to fix the Government parity of or ratio between the two
                            metals at 32 to 1. The unit of value will be a gold yen, which will be
                            one-half the weight and fineness as the gold dollar of the United
                            States. The proposed unit of value will therefore be the exact
                            equivalent of 50 cents United States money, and approximately of the
                            same value as the present unit of value in Japan, the silver yen, which
                            at the current rate of exchange of to-day is worth about 51 cents United
                            States money. It is proposed that the smallest gold coin minted shall be
                            a 5–yen piece.</p>
                        <p>The further coinage of silver will be limited to subsidiary coins. The
                            silver yen now in circulation will be maintained at par with the gold
                            yen by the Government being prepared to redeem them in gold whenever
                            called upon to do so. In this connection it is important to note that
                            there are about 140,000,000 of Japanese silver yen in circulation, of
                            which it is estimated that about 70,000,000 are in circulation as money
                            in China and the English, French, and other colonies and settlements in
                            the East. Should the ratio between gold and silver become greater than 1
                            to 32, the tendency would seem to be to drive the outstanding silver
                            coin back to Japan for redemption.</p>
                        <p>The vernacular press reports considerable dissatisfaction among the
                            manufacturing and commercial classes with the proposed change of
                            standard, and it is reported that the Cotton Spinners’ Association have
                            prepared a protest against it to present to the Diet. Those interested
                            in manufactures in Japan are at present very prosperous and satisfied
                            with the returns their investments are bringing in. They are, naturally,
                            as a class, not disposed to view favorably a proposed change the effects
                            of which upon their interests they have no means of determining
                            beforehand.</p>
                        <p>It is generally believed, however, that the Government bill will, in
                            perhaps a modified form, become a law. It is supposed that the principal
                            object the Government has in view in bringing about the change is to
                            enable it, should such a measure become necessary or expedient, to
                            negotiate a loan in Europe on better terms than would be possible, as
                            they believe, if Japan remained on a silver basis.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have the honor to inform you
                            that in view of the conversations which we have had respecting the claim
                            of Charles Oberlander against Mexico, I submitted to the Government of
                            Mexico the suggestion which I made to you that that claim should be
                            decided by arbitration, and that I am authorized by my Government to
                            propose that solution to you.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Mexico deems that, to the end of avoiding the expense
                            incident to a mixed commission, which would be costly, as well as
                            unnecessary, in view of the circumstance that a solitary case is in
                            controversy, wherein the principal contention is as to the question of
                            fact whether Oberlander was arrested in Mexico or in the United States,
                            it would be expedient that both Governments should name a single
                            arbitrator; that in order to preserve in this regard an absolute
                            equality between the parties in interest this arbitrator should not be a
                            citizen of Mexico or of the United States, and that he should decide the
                            question by a simple proceeding; that is to say, that each Government
                            submit to him the correspondence, documents, and proofs which justify
                            the position it has assumed in the discussion of this matter, with a
                            statement of its case, in which may be set forth its manner of looking
                            at the question, so that the arbitrator may decide, in view of these
                            respective presentations, without the necessity of hearing the lawyers
                            of the parties in interest or of taking testimony, with the exception
                            that, after examining the documents which are submitted to him, the
                            arbitrator may deem it necessary, in order better to make his decision,
                            to take evidence upon some particular point.</p>
                        <p>The arbitrator will decide whether Oberlander has or has not right to any
                            indemnification on the part of the Government of Mexico; and, in case he
                            may decide this point affirmatively, he will fix the amount of this
                            indemnification, upon the indispensable condition that such
                            indemnification may not exceed the sum which the Department of State has
                            claimed of Mexico as indemnification for the injuries which it believes
                            Oberlander suffered as a result of his imprisonment.</p>
                        <p>If these points should be acceptable to the Government of the United
                            States, we can turn our attention at once to the designation of an
                            arbitrator, or to the manner of selecting one.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Olney</hi>: I received last night a
                            cablegram from Señor Mariscal, in reply to the suggestion which I had
                            made him, to the effect that Señor Don Carlos Calvo, a writer on
                            international law and Argentine minister at Berlin, should be appointed
                            arbitrator to decide the claim of Charles Oberlander against Mexico,
                            wherein he states that he thinks that the appointment of the Argentine
                            minister at Madrid would be more acceptable to both Governments,
                            inasmuch as the latter gentleman is known to both. If you accept this
                            suggestion we may conclude the arrangement at once.</p>
                        <p>I was writing this note when I received yours of to day on the same

                            the recommendation therein made by you I will send you an official note
                            in which I will propose that this case be submitted to arbitration, and
                            will specify the procedure to be observed by the arbitrator, leaving in
                            abeyance the matter of the designation of that officer until you shall

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In response to your two notes of December
                            26, 1896, relative to the claims of Charles Oberlander and Barbara M.
                            Messenger against the Mexican Government, I have the honor to submit
                            herewith for your consideration copy of a draft of a protocol which I
                            believe will cover the suggestions contained in your notes. If this
                            draft meets with your approval I shall be glad to sign it with you in
                            duplicate. If, on the contrary, you perceive objection thereto, I should
                            be glad to have a conference with you at your earliest convenience, with
                            a view to so amending it as to remove the objections.</p>
                        <p>As soon as the agreement is signed it would be well for each Government
                            to make known to the Argentine minister at Madrid its desire that he act
                            as referee in the case. Each Government in so doing will, I presume,
                            utilize the offices of its own representative at that capital for the
                            purpose of explaining to Mr. Quesada that the papers will be submitted

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have had the honor to receive
                            your note No. 204, dated yesterday, with which you are pleased to send
                            me a draft of a ‘protocol containing the basis proposed in the note
                            which I addressed <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0406"/>to you on the
                            26th of December last for the submission to arbitration of the claim of
                            Charles Oberlander against Mexico.</p>
                        <p>I find that this protocol is not in accord with the instructions I have
                            received from the Government of Mexico, and which I communicated to you
                            in my aforesaid note, and it would not, therefore, be possible for me to
                            sign it without submitting it to my Government and receiving its
                            instructions.</p>
                        <p>The points of difference which I find are as follows: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>The Government of Mexico is prepared to submit to arbitration
                                    the claim of Charles Oberlander, but not that of Barbara M.
                                    Messenger, because in the correspondence which took place in
                                    regard to this matter I understand that the Government of the
                                    United States desisted from the latter claim.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>Inasmuch as, in the correspondence exchanged between the two
                                    Governments, the nature of the Oberlander claim and the manner
                                    in which it is regarded by the respective Governments are
                                    clearly set forth, the recital of the facts made in the preamble
                                    of the draft protocol appears to me to be unnecessary, and in
                                    order to accept it it would be needful to modify it in terms
                                    which would leave no doubt as to the position each Government
                                    has taken in this affair.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>It would be advisable to supplement article 5 by stating in
                                    terms that both Governments will pay in equal moieties, not only
                                    the compensation of the arbitrator, but also the remaining
                                    expenses occasioned by the arbitration.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I will at once consult my Government as to the dates of payment (plazos)
                            proposed in the draft protocol.</p>
                        <p>If you are willing to modify the draft as above suggested, I will
                            consider myself authorized to sign it in conformity to the instructions
                            which my Government has given me; but in the contrary case I will have
                            to await its new instructions.</p>
                        <p>For the rest, it appears to me appropriate that, when the two Governments
                            shall have agreed upon the terms of the protocol, they should, through
                            their respective diplomatic agents at Madrid, inquire of Señor Don
                            Vicente G. Quesada, minister of the Argentine Republic, if he is
                            prepared to accept the charge, at what place he wishes to have the
                            respective documents laid before him.</p>
                        <p>If, after taking cognizance of these observations, you desire that we
                            should have a conference upon this matter, I shall attend at the
                            Department whenever you shall summon me.</p>

                            receipt of your note of the 27th instant, setting forth the objections
                            to the draft of a protocol referring the claims of Oberlander and
                            Messenger to arbitration.</p>
                        <p>The first objection is that your Government is not willing to include the
                            claim of Mrs. Messenger in the reference to the arbitrator, because in
                            the correspondence which took place in regard to the matter you
                            understood that the Government of the United States had desisted from

                            in Mexico to be carefully examined with reference to this claim. It will
                            be remembered that the claims of Oberlander and Mrs. Messenger were
                            jointly presented, although there were separate memorials, and that they
                            have been treated together throughout the entire correspondence. On June
                            22, 1893, this Department sent to Mr. Gray, our minister in Mexico, the
                            memorials of Oberlander and Mrs. Messenger, with instructions to bring
                            the claims unofficially to the attention of Mr. Mariscal, with a view of
                            obtaining from the Mexican Government such a report of the facts as
                            would enable the United States to decide upon its proper course of
                            action. On November 25, 1893, Mr. Butler, our chargé d’affaires ad
                            interim in Mexico, was directed to present the claims for payment, with
                            the hope that the Mexican Government would “give both these claims an
                            early and favorable consideration and make to each claimant a just and
                            substantial indemnity.” In that instruction Mrs. Messenger’s complaint
                            and the grounds of her right to indemnity were set forth as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Mrs. Messenger’s complaint is of her illness and the injury to
                                    her nervous system resulting from the fright and shock she
                                    suffered when her house was violently broken into by the Mexican
                                    police officers on the occasion of Oberlander’s abduction.
                                    Having given their hospitality and the shelter of their home to
                                    their unfortunate countryman, fleeing from his relentless
                                    pursuers, she and her husband might at least have relied upon
                                    ordinary feelings of humanity and common respect for the
                                    sanctity of a private dwelling as securing them from invasion.
                                    But they were mistaken; the Mexicans stealthily surrounded the
                                    house, and, availing themselves of the momentary absence of Mr.
                                    Messenger, who, suspecting evil, had gone to seek the aid of a
                                    neighbor for the defense of his unhappy guest, burst open the
                                    doors and, with disregard of all decency and propriety, to the
                                    great terror and indignation of the lady, after a violent
                                    scuffle, dragged their victim away, as Mrs. Messenger supposed,
                                    to his immediate death.</p>
                                <p>This lady was expecting in a few months from that time to become
                                    a mother, but the shock of these outrages brought on a severe
                                    illness, which resulted in a miscarriage on the 25th day of May,
                                    1892. Since that time her health has been bad, though previously
                                    it had always been excellent; much of the time she has been sick
                                    in bed, is often unable to perform her household duties, and
                                    suffers great and distressing nervous disorders, tending, as her
                                    physician says, “to a permanent or chronic state.”</p>
                                <p>Her condition is directly traceable to the conduct of the Mexican
                                    policemen at her house on the night of May 21, 1892.</p>
                                <p>The mere breaking into the house by the policemen would
                                    constitute a just ground for indemnity against Mexico, acting as
                                    they were under the orders of the Mexican Justice Fuertes for
                                    the arrest of Oberlander. The directly resulting injuries to the
                                    lady of the house greatly aggravate the damages she is entitled
                                    to claim.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>On May 10, 1894, the Department called the attention of Mr. Gray, our
                            minister, to the instruction of November 25, 1893, in reference to the
                            claims of Oberlander and Mrs. Messenger, and instructed him to call
                            attention to these cases and press for a reply. March 15, 1895, the
                            Department wrote to Mr. Butler, chargé d’affaires ad interim, in regard
                            to both claims, as usual. The closing paragraph is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Department is disposed to admit the correctness of the view
                                    taken by the Mexican Government that Mrs. Messenger’s illness
                                    was brought on, not so much by the forcible entry of her house
                                    as it was by her own conduct in pursuing the kidnaping party,
                                    and that she is therefore probably not entitled to the large
                                    damages claimed by her. But the fact that her house, or that of
                                    her husband, was broken into and their guest forcibly abducted
                                    undoubtedly gives them ground to demand adequate indemnity.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>On June 7, 1895, Mr. Butler’s attention was called to “the claims of
                            Charles Oberlander and Mrs. Barbara Messenger,” and he was informed that
                            “this Government desires a prompt response from the Mexican Government
                            to its latest representation in these claims.” On November <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0408"/>30, 1895, this Department received the
                            law and the evidence affecting both of these claims and said to Mr.
                            Ransom, our minister: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>This Government, after careful consideration of all that has been
                                    said on both sides, is satisfied as to the facts, and is
                                    constrained to request payment of the indemnity, subject to the
                                    modification as to Mrs. Messenger’s claim made in the
                                    instruction of March 15, last.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>On May 15, 1896, Mr. Ransom was again instructed “in regard to the claims
                            of Charles Oberlander and Mrs. Messenger,” and informed that “as the
                            matter now stands nothing seems to be left open for further discussion
                            except the amount of the indemnity to which Oberlander and Mrs.
                            Messenger are entitled.” That was the last communication to our minister
                            on the subject.</p>
                        <p>This Government modified its demand in behalf of Mrs. Messenger March 15,
                            1895, in the language above quoted, but the claim was never withdrawn,
                            and the United States has never ceased to urge the payment of an
                            adequate indemnity to Mrs. Messenger for breaking into her house and
                            forcibly abducting therefrom a fellow-countryman whom she had received
                            as a guest. The claim of Mrs. Messenger has always been regarded as
                            practically inseparable from that of Oberlander; it grew out of the same
                            facts and depends largely upon the same evidence. No reason is seen why
                            it should not be referred to the arbitrator for consideration along with
                            the claim of Oberlander. The reference to arbitration will carry with it
                            not only Mrs. Messenger’s memorial, but all that this Department and the
                            Government of Mexico have said with reference to her claim, including
                            the admission of March 15, 1895, above quoted.</p>
                        <p>Your second objection is to the recital of facts in the preamble of the
                            protocol.</p>
                        <p>This precaution was intended merely as a brief description of the issues
                            raised in the claim; but as the case is to be heard upon the
                            correspondence, documents, and proofs which have passed between the two
                            Governments, nothing is necessary in the preamble but such a description
                            of the claim as will enable the arbitrator to identify it. I am,
                            therefore, willing to waive anything in the preamble to which you
                            object.</p>
                        <p>The third suggestion relates to article 5, and is to the effect that the
                            expenses occasioned by the arbitration shall be borne equally by the two
                            Governments. This suggestion is agreed to, and I propose that article 5
                            read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Reasonable compensation to the arbitrator, and other expenses
                                    occasioned by the arbitration, shall be paid in equal moieties
                                    by the two Governments.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The expense of presenting its own case is, of course, to be defrayed by
                            each Government.</p>
                        <p>With reference to other changes in the protocol orally suggested by, you
                            in our conference yesterday morning, a memorandum was taken of these and
                            the draft for signature has been accordingly amended. I send you
                            herewith a copy of the amended draft, as well as one of the draft as
                            originally drawn—the latter to replace that which was sent to you
                            January 26, but which has been used by us in noting the changes agreed
                            upon.</p>
                        <p>I have endeavored to eliminate from the preamble all matter to which you
                            object, but I hope you will still regard it as open to such further
                            changes as will make it a more satisfactory description and
                            identification of the subject matter in question.</p>
                        <p>Accept, Mr. Minister, etc.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have had the honor to receive
                            your note of yesterday, No. 207, whereby you were pleased to transmit to
                            me the new draft of a protocol for the submission to arbitration of the
                            claim of Charles Oberlander, said draft having been prepared after you
                            had considered the observations which I made relative to that which you
                            sent me as an inclosure to your note, No. 204, of the 26th instant in my
                            reply of the 27th.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the claim of Mrs. Barbara M. Messenger, I must inform you
                            that as this case has not been discussed by this legation with the
                            Department of State, but by the United States legation in Mexico with
                            the department of foreign relations of the Mexican Government, I am not
                            thoroughly familiar with all its details, and I was under the impression
                            that the Department of State had decided not to push Mrs. Messenger’s
                            claim. On examination of the case I find that Mr. E. C. Butler, chargé
                            d’affaires of the United States in Mexico, wrote, in a communication
                            which he addressed to Mr. Mariscal April 9, 1895, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Department is disposed to admit the correctness of the view
                                    taken by the Mexican Government that Mrs. Messenger’s illness
                                    was brought on, not so much by the forcible entrance of her
                                    house as by her own conduct in pursuing the kidnaping party, and
                                    that she is therefore probably not entitled to the large damages
                                    claimed by her.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>This circumstance left me under the impression that the Department of
                            State had decided to drop Mrs. Messenger’s claim. This, however, not
                            being the case, I do not object to its being included in the pending
                            protocol.</p>
                        <p>I am very glad of the acceptance of the other modifications proposed by
                            me, both in my note of the 27th instant and in the interview which I had
                            with you on the 28th instant at the Department of State, and I therefore
                            only have to suggest that the official name of Mexico is the “United
                            States of Mexico” (literally United Mexican States), and not the
                            “Republic of the United States of Mexico,” as it appears in the preamble
                            of your draft, and to propose, in pursuance of the instructions of my
                            Government, another modification which, if accepted by you, as I trust
                            it will be, will permit me to sign the protocol. This modification is
                            the extension to three months of the term of two months which is fixed
                            in Article II for the submission to the arbitrator by each Government of
                            the copies of the correspondence, documents, and evidence which it is to
                            lay before him, so that my Government may have more time to prepare
                            those copies and its argument.</p>
                        <p>In your note No. 204 you were pleased to refer to the desirability, after
                            the signing of the protocol, of each Government apprising the Argentine
                            minister at Madrid of its wish that he should act as arbitrator in the
                            case. As I think it preferable to sign the protocol after ascertaining
                            that Mr. Quesada is willing to accept the trust which it is designed to
                            repose in him, I shall communicate with the Government of Mexico by
                            cable requesting it to instruct the legation of Mexico at Madrid to
                            inquire of Mr. Quesada whether he is willing to accept that trust, if
                            you think this step preferable, and will make a similar inquiry of Mr.
                            Quesada; then, in case of his acceptance, we will proceed at once to
                            sign the protocol. If you prefer that we should sign it before <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0410"/>addressing Mr. Quesada, I will
                            do so on receiving notice from you to that effect.</p>

                            receipt of your note of January 30, 1897, in relation to the arbitration
                            of the claims of Charles Oberlander and Barbara M. Messenger, and the
                            expression of your readiness to sign the protocol after further
                            modifications in one or two small particulars.</p>
                        <p>The words “Republic of” in the headlines of the preamble were
                            inadvertently inserted and had not been observed. The official name of
                            your Government was correctly given in the body of the instrument.</p>
                        <p>I agree to the extension of the time allowed for preparing and submitting
                            the case of each Government from two to three months, and have
                            accordingly changed the word “two “to “three” in line 1 of article 2 of
                            the protocol.</p>
                        <p>At your suggestion, the word “common” has been inserted before “expenses”
                            in article 5.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with your further suggestion, I have cabled the minister of
                            the United States at Madrid to ascertain whether Mr. Quesada will act as
                            arbitrator upon the joint request of the two Governments. As soon as his
                            reply is received ‘the substance of it will be communicated to you and
                            when both Governments have been apprised of Mr. Quesada’s acceptance, I
                            shall be glad to sign the protocol in duplicate with you. Copies with
                            the modifications agreed upon are now being prepared and will be ready
                            for signature as soon as it is known that the arbitrator selected will
                            act.</p>

                            with reference to our conversation of yesterday in regard to the
                            acceptance of Dr. Don Vicente G. Quesada, Argentine minister at Madrid,
                            as the arbitrator in the case of the claim of Charles Oberlander and
                            Barbara M. Messenger against Mexico, that having inquired by cable of
                            Señor Mariscal, secretary of foreign relations of the United Mexican
                            States, if he had received the acceptance of Señor Quesada, he replied
                            informing me that Señor Quesada had expressed his willingness to accept
                            the charge, but that in order to do so he needed the permission of his
                            Government, which he had asked; and therefore his acceptance can not be
                            considered as definitive until he shall have obtained such license.</p>
                        <p>It appears to me, in consequence, that the acceptance of the arbitrator
                            will take place when his Government shall have given him the
                            corresponding permission, of which we will be advised by cable, and we
                            can thereupon proceed to sign the pending protocol.</p>

                            dispatch No. 664, dated March 12, 1897, from our minister at Madrid, and
                            with it copy (in Spanish) of a communication, dated March 10, 1897,
                            received by him from Señor Don Vicente G. Quesada, the arbitrator
                            selected by the United States and Mexico to settle the Oberlander and
                            Messenger cases, giving notice that he, the arbitrator, will not take up
                            the matter until August next.</p>
                        <p>In view of this fact, and of the further fact that this Department has
                            been unexpectedly required by the arbitrator to present the case of the

                            August 1, 1897. By the terms of the protocol (Article II) the time for
                            such submission will expire about the middle of June, and it is not
                            certain that this Department, with its limited facilities, will be able

                        <p>The proposed postponement of the date for submission of the cases will
                            also give the arbitrator more time for their consideration. Article IV
                            of the protocol requires him to render his award within six months from
                            the date of submission, and if the cases are submitted in June a month
                            and more of the time will expire before the arbitrator gives the cases

                                sole arbitrator by the high Governments of the United States of
                                America and the United States of Mexico, as appears from the
                                agreement concluded in the city of Washington on the 2d day of
                                March, 1897, by their representatives, Hon. Richard Olney, Secretary

                                course to be pursued by the arbitrator in the discharge of his
                                functions in passing a final decision concerning the claims
                                presented by Mr. Charles Oberlander and Mrs. Barbara M. Messinger
                                against the Government of Mexico through the Secretary of State of
                                the United States of America and through the diplomatic channel:</p>
                            <p>Being actuated by a sincere desire to acknowledge, by an impartial
                                and unbiased decision, the great honor that has been conferred upon
                                me;</p>
                            <p>Having duly examined and carefully studied the documents and
                                statements which have been laid before me by the legations of those
                                high Governments at this capital, which is the place designated for
                                the rendering of my award within the time fixed, which time has been
                                extended by agreement of the high contracting parties;</p>
                            <p>Whereas it appears, as regards the facts:</p>
                            <p>That Charles Oberlander, in the memorial which he addressed to the
                                President of the United States of America on the 10th of January,
                                1893, presented as a document in support of his claim, among others,
                                the statement made by him before a notary public of the United
                                States of America, whereby he confesses that his object, when he
                                crossed over into the territory of Mexico, was to procure evidence
                                for use in a criminal case, i. e., that of Crossthwaite <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. The Mexican Cruz, who was charged with
                                kidnapping, and consequently for the furtherance of a private
                                interest;</p>
                            <p>That he was arrested on the 20th of May, 1892, at Tijuana, in Mexican
                                    <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0417"/>territory, as is
                                admitted by Mr. Ryan, United States minister in Mexico, by a
                                telegram addressed to Mr. Elaine, Secretary of State, on the 24th of
                                May of that year;</p>
                            <p>That the vice-consul of the United States at Ensenada, Mexico, under
                                date of May 27 of the aforesaid year, in an official note,
                                reproduces the telegram sent by him to the United States minister in
                                Mexico, informing him that Oberlander has been arrested in Mexican
                                territory, without my doubt whatever, which assertions are of an
                                official and conclusive character;</p>
                            <p>That Oberlander held, at that time, the office of deputy sheriff at
                                San Diego, and was a police officer of Upper California, and had in
                                his pocket the warrant of arrest issued by the township judge in the
                                case of the Mexican Donaciano Cruz, who was accused by the very
                                person in whose interest Oberlander had gone to Mexico in quest of
                                evidence;</p>
                            <p>That he was arrested by the Mexican authorities in Mexican territory,
                                for having endeavored, it is said, to effect the arrest of Cruz, in
                                obedience to the warrant of which he was the bearer;</p>
                            <p>That when he was arrested and searched by the territorial
                                authorities, the aforesaid warrant of arrest, a pistol and
                                cartridges were found in his possession;</p>
                            <p>That the nickel handcuffs which are put upon the hands of prisoners,
                                both in Mexico and in some States of the American Union, are used by
                                police officers to secure persons under arrest, but in nowise for
                                the purpose of torturing them;</p>
                            <p>That Oberlander, if he thought his arrest illegal, ought to have
                                brought a criminal and civil charge before the territorial courts,
                                asking for the punishment of the guilty parties, and for indemnity
                                on account of the injuries done him, having failed to do which, he
                                renounced his right;</p>
                            <p>That instead of taking legal steps before the courts of the country,
                                he admitted, in the declaration made by him at Tijuana May 25, 1892,
                                before the Mexican judge, which declaration, in view of the nature
                                of the facts, was a charge or accusation, “that on the night of
                                Saturday, between 7 and 8 o’clock, he sent a man named Melon Santos,
                                whom he did not know, and who was acting as his custodian or guard,
                                to buy some cigars, he remaining with a Frenchman who also guarded
                                him, and availing himself of that opportunity he ran out of the
                                room, giving the Frenchman a push and thus making his escape toward
                                the line; that owing to the precipitancy of his flight he fell on
                                the road and received the scratches which he has on his body.”
                                Second, as to his capture, he said “that they seized him and brought
                                him back under arrest:” “that they maltreated him in prison;” “that
                                in addition to the aforesaid scratches he hit his head in trying to
                                get out of a window of the room in which he was imprisoned;”</p>
                            <p>That the escape by means of force and violence used against the guard
                                set over him by the judicial authorities of Mexico constitutes in
                                itself an additional crime which aggravates the offense for which he
                                was arrested, even if his arrest was originally unjust and
                                illegal.</p>
                            <p>That this declaration of Oberlander was made subsequently to the
                                issuance of the permit to absent himself, which was given him by the
                                judge of first instance of Ensenada, on his mere promise that he
                                would return to make his declaration, he crossing to the Territory
                                of California, where he remained for twenty-four hours, and thence
                                returned to that of Mexico, as he had promised to do, without
                                compulsion or fears that his life would be threatened by those who
                                arrested him, and made his declaration before the territorial
                                judge;</p>
                            <p>That a man who was at liberty to make his declaration before the <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0418"/>territorial judge and who
                                could do so in safety was also at liberty to bring a criminal and
                                civil action against those who had arrested him;</p>
                            <p>That before the territorial judge, who was the only magistrate
                                competent to take cognizance of and decide concerning the arrest and
                                the matters connected therewith, he did not specify the acts of
                                violence to which he had been subjected, or state who had tortured
                                him, as he has since endeavored to show by unofficial specific
                                charges, or designating any persons, he rendered it impossible to
                                elicit the truth and to punish the guilty parties, if any such there
                                were;</p>
                            <p>That he claims that, on the night of his escape, he reached the
                                territory of the United States of America, and that there, in
                                Messenger’s house, “his pursuers entered and took him prisoner,”
                                which facts it was incumbent upon him to prove (and this proof was
                                admissible and legal before the Mexican judge only who had charge of
                                the case against his captors), since there was no impossibility or
                                force that prevented him from doing so;</p>
                            <p>That before said judge, and in the same declaration which recognizes
                                as “the true declaration” because “he could tell the truth without
                                danger” (Mr. Olney to Minister Ransom, November 23, 1895), the
                                aforesaid Oberlander adds, “that on the way they took him in a
                                carriage and he suffered no ill treatment;”</p>
                            <p>That he stated, in the same instrument, “that Messenger’s wife did
                                not see the way in which they took him;”</p>
                            <p>That the witness Joseph Messenger is not a competent witness, owing
                                to the interest which he has in the case, since his wife and he, as
                                the owners of the house, claim an indemnity of $50,000; that his
                                statement is liable to exception for that legal reason, according to
                                the laws of Mexico, and that it is, moreover, of no value, since he
                                states “that he does not know in what way Oberlander was arrested,
                                or for what reason;”</p>
                            <p>That the witness Mrs. Messie Mosser says that “Oberlander spoke with
                                a son of deponent at the door; that she does not know at what hour
                                or in what way the aforesaid Oberlander was arrested.”</p>
                            <p>That the witness Sirl states “that he saw some men near by, whom he
                                did not know, coming down the hill; that he saw their figures only;
                                that he does not know how the occurrence took place or in what way
                                Oberlander was arrested.”</p>
                            <p>That the judge of Ensenada de Todos Santos thought that there was no
                                reason why Oberlander should be detained any longer, and from the
                                evidence obtained on the occasion of the preliminary examination he
                                ordered the preliminary arrest of the persons who were charged with
                                arresting Oberlander in United States territory, turning them over
                                to the district judge of Lower California, as being presumably
                                guilty of the offense against the external security of Mexico.</p>
                            <p>That a warrant of arrest is, in its nature, a document that is not
                                final, and that an appeal may be had from it.</p>
                            <p>That, it having been affirmed by the circuit court of Mexico, the
                                accused parties availed themselves of the right granted them by the
                                laws of the country to apply for release on bail, while the criminal
                                case was continued;</p>
                            <p>That, the case being continued in the second district court of Lower
                                California, the judge ordered a discontinuance of proceedings in the
                                case of the first one of those accused, and acquitted the four
                                others;</p>
                            <p>That this decision was affirmed by the circuit court of Mexico, after
                                the proceedings had been held which are provided for by the law of
                                the country;</p>
                            <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0419"/>
                            <p>That, Oberlander being charged by Donaciano Cruz with an attempt to
                                kidnap in Mexican territory, and Cruz and others being charged by
                                Oberlander with kidnaping in the territory of the United States of
                                America, the territorial judge received the evidence in both cases,
                                the same Oberlander making his statement or charge, and the judge
                                decided and enforced the territorial law according to what had been
                                alleged and proved, and this decision was affirmed and remained
                                valid;</p>
                            <p>That, finally, it is alleged on the part of Mexico that Charles
                                Oberlander was arrested in pursuance of a judicial warrant at
                                Brewerton, eight years ago, being charged with the crime of robbery,
                                whereupon he fled to California;</p>
                            <p>That he was afterwards accused of endeavoring to obtain the consent
                                of two young girls named, respectively, Katie Kehse and Louisa
                                Hawing, for an immoral purpose, and of outraging a girl named Nellie
                                Bagwell, all of whom were inmates of the orphan asylum at Mount
                                Tabor;</p>
                            <p>That in that criminal case, application was made judicially for the
                                appointment of a commission of physicians, it being supposed that
                                Oberlander had lost his reason;</p>
                            <p>That Judge Row, of New York, appointed three physicians, and Drs.
                                Kauffman and Walsh, as witnesses, stated that they had known
                                Oberlander since his childhood; that he was not in his right mind,
                                and that his conduct had always been that of a person whose mental
                                faculties were unsound;</p>
                            <p>That in virtue of the evidence furnished in the aforesaid case, the
                                district attorney and Oberlander’s counsel held that Oberlander’s
                                insanity began in his childhood, it having been observed while he
                                attended school, and having afterwards continued without
                                interruption; that the form of insanity from which he suffered was
                                the persecution monomania;</p>
                            <p>That the conclusions reached by the experts in their report were that
                                “Oberlander is suffering from a mental disease which is specially
                                developed in persons who inherit a disordered mind, and which
                                continues during their lifetime, it being known as a form of
                                dementia called paranoia;”</p>
                            <p>That, in view of these antecedents, Judge Row declared that
                                Oberlander was not responsible for the offenses with which he was
                                charged, and ordered that he should be removed to the insane asylum
                                at Utica, and not to the asylum for insane criminals at
                                Matteawan.</p>
                            <p>Whereas it appears, in respect to Mrs. Barbara M. Messenger, that, by
                                a note from the United States legation in Mexico, bearing date of
                                April 9, 1895, addressed by Mr. Butler to the minister of foreign
                                relations of the United States of Mexico, it is positively declared
                                that “the Department of State is prepared to admit the correctness
                                of the opinion expressed by the Mexican Government that, as to the
                                illness of Mrs. Messenger, it was caused not so much by the forcible
                                entrance of her house as it was by her own conduct in pursuing the
                                kidnapers, and that she is therefore probably not entitled to the
                                large indemnity that she claims; but it (the Department of State)
                                considers it certain that the fact that her house, or that of her
                                husband, was forcibly entered, and that her guest was removed
                                therefrom by force, undoubtedly entitles them to demand an adequate
                                indemnity.”</p>
                            <p>That, in view of the foregoing limitation of the demand, it is not
                                pertinent to examine the statements made with regard to Mrs.
                                Messenger’s alleged illness;</p>
                            <p>That, in the statement made by the department of foreign relations of
                                Mexico, July 15, 1895 and officially sent to the United States
                                legagation <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0420"/>with a note of
                                July 16, of the same year, it is said, in connection with this
                                claim:</p>
                            <p>“As regards Barbara Messenger’s demand, it is a subject of
                                satisfaction that the United States Government has agreed with that
                                of Mexico that the illness of this woman was caused not so much by
                                the alleged forcible entrance of her house as it was by her own
                                conduct in pursuing the so called kidnappers, and that she is
                                consequently not entitled to the indemnity which she claims. It then
                                states, however, that the fact that her house or that of her husband
                                was forcibly entered and her guest removed therefrom by force
                                entitled them to demand an ad equate indemnity;”</p>
                            <p>That the Government of Mexico denies that the house was forcibly
                                entered, and therefore this fact, which is differently stated by the
                                two high parties, is fundamental, and should be juridically
                                appreciated in the award;</p>
                            <p>That Mr. Ransom, United States minister in Mexico, in a note
                                addressed to Mr. Mariscal, minister of foreign relations of the
                                United States of Mexico, dated December 11, 1895, positively states
                                that the demand of his Government is based upon the aforesaid note
                                of Mr. Butler, and that sent by him with its inclosure;
                                consequently, the basis of the two claims, on the merits of which
                                the award is to be pronounced, is clearly established;</p>
                            <p>That it is a doctrine of international law that “within the
                                jurisdictional limits of every sovereign State, the representatives
                                of authority, are personally responsible to the extent established
                                by the internal public law of each State. When they fail to perform
                                their duty by going beyond their powers or violating the law they
                                create, according to the circumstances, for those whose rights have
                                been disregarded, a legal right of appeal through the executive or
                                judicial channels; but, with respect to third parties, whether
                                native or foreign, the responsibility of the Government that has
                                appointed them is a purely moral one, and can only be made direct
                                and effective in case of complicity or denial of justice.” (Calvo,
                                International Law, Vol. III, p. 120.)</p>
                            <p>That in the present case the demanding Government has declared “that
                                it has no complaint to make of the proceedings taken against those
                                who arrested Oberlander, if such proceedings are considered as a
                                purely domestic matter” (Mr. Richard Olney, Secretary of State, to
                                Mr. Ransom, United States minister in Mexico, Washington, Nov. 30,
                                1895); that, in view of this recognition of the demanding
                                Government, there was no complicity or denial of justice, and
                                therefore the decision of the territorial judges which declares that
                                it has not been shown that Oberlander’s arrest took place in
                                territory belonging to the United States, was legal and valid in
                                Mexican territory, in virtue of such being the legal truth, against
                                which neither the executive nor the legislative branch of a
                                government can take action without committing an outrage upon the
                                independence of the judicial branch;</p>
                            <p>That, although the demanding government denies that the claim of res
                                judicata, raised by that against which the demand is made, has no
                                extraterritorial power to exclude a civil action, in the present
                                case it is not questioned that that decision of the Mexican courts
                                is valid in the territory of the United States, but, on the
                                contrary, that there is no diplomatic claim having annulling power
                                to revise that decision and to claim, diplomatically, that, within
                                the sphere of the sovereignty of the courts, information must be
                                accepted that is designed to overthrow the juridical effect of the
                                res judicata, and to dispose of the taxes paid by the inhabitants
                                (which is a “domestic matter” in its very nature) for the benefit of
                                foreigners who have been unwilling, through bad faith, <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0421"/>or owing to ignorance or what they
                                consider expediency, to have recourse to the courts of the country
                                in order to assert their alleged lights, as it was their duty to
                                do;</p>
                            <p>That, it would be offensive to the independence and sovereignty of
                                nation if the statements of witnesses made before notaries in a
                                foreign country, without being subject to any of the guaranties and

                                themselves in their own favor, could be presented, diplomatically,
                                as a basis to give them extraterritorial legal force, annulling the

                            <p>That, it is a doctrine of international law “that all that other
                                nations can ask of a government is that it shall show that it is
                                actuated by a deep feeling of justice and impartiality; that it
                                shall remind its subjects, by all the means in its power, of the
                                respect which they owe to international obligations, and that it
                                shall not leave unpunished such transgressions as may have been
                                committed by them; finally, that it shall act in everything with
                                good faith and in accordance with the precepts of natural law; to go
                                farther than this would be to raise a private injury to the height
                                of a public offense, and to impute to a whole nation an offense
                                committed by one of its members” (Calvo, op. cit., p. 134, Vol.
                                III);</p>
                            <p>That, it is a doctrine of international law “that the moral bounds
                                which unite nations are of the same order, and imply an absolute
                                character of solidarity; a State could legitimately neither claim
                                among others a privileged situation which it was not prepared to
                                allow foreigners to enjoy, nor could it claim for its own subjects
                                advantages greater than those allowed by the common law of the
                                inhabitants of the country “(op. cit.);</p>
                            <p>That the high contracting parties have recognized as principles of
                                international law those clearly stated by the mixed commission which
                                sat at Washington in pursuance of the treaty of July 4, 1868, which,
                                in deciding the case of the town (people?) of Cenecu, laid down as a
                                doctrine of conventional law between the United States and Mexico
                                the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>The following matters can alone form the basis of a claim of
                                        one nation against another: Offenses or acts of injustice
                                        committed by the supreme authority of a country against
                                        which no recourse can be had to any other authority of the
                                        same country; or such as, having been originally committed
                                        by subordinate authorities, have not been made good by the
                                        superior authority whose duty it was to do so when so
                                        requested, in the manner provided by the local laws. The
                                        cases in which an injury done to a citizen of a country may
                                        furnish grounds for an international claim are, then,
                                        reduced to two categories: either the injury has been done
                                        by so high an authority that there is no remedy provided in
                                        the laws of the country to furnish redress for its acts, or
                                        to prevent the damage that may arise therefrom; or the
                                        remedy exists, it has been tried and has produced no effect,
                                        because those who ought to correct the error affirm it or
                                        refuse to correct it, thereby making it irremediable. Where
                                        there has been no sovereign and irresponsible action in the
                                        country of the supreme power, nor any denial of the justice
                                        for which application has been diligently made, there is no
                                        ground for an international claim.</p>

                            <p>That, in the present case, both Oberlander, who complained of the act
                                by a statement made before the territorial judge, and Mrs.
                                Messenger, whose husband made, freely and spontaneously, a statement
                                before the same judge, did not bring the criminal and civil actions
                                which they had a right to bring before the courts of the country,
                                but had recourse to diplomacy without any good cause to do so, and
                                without having any privilege or right to claim that exceptional
                                proceedings should be taken in their cases, in violation of the
                                doctrines of international law above quoted;</p>

                            <p>That the demanding Government has established precedents in this
                                matter by rejecting the claims of foreigners who demanded indemnity,
                                being protected and supported by a diplomatic claim, as appears in
                                the case of President Cleveland in his message to Congress of May 6,
                                1886, relative to the claims presented by the legation of Great
                                China. Mr. Cleveland refused to accept diplomatic intervention,
                                although hg admitted that “scandalous occurrences had taken place at
                                Rock Springs, in Wyoming Territory,” and added that the facts in
                                evidence were: “That a number of Chinese subjects in September last
                                (1885) were murdered at Rock Springs, that many others were wounded,
                                and that, all were robbed of their property, after the unfortunate
                                survivors had been driven from their homes;”</p>
                            <p>That in that document President Cleveland declared that the United
                                States Government was not under obligations to pay an indemnity for
                                the losses caused by these crimes, thus disregarding the claim of
                                the Chinese legation;</p>
                            <p>That the words of President Cleveland in his message are clear and
                                decisive, where he says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>When the Chinese minister, in virtue of his instructions,
                                        shall make these the basis of an appeal to the principles
                                        and convictions of humanity, there is no ground for any
                                        redress. But when he goes further, and, taking as a
                                        precedent the action of the Chinese Government in past
                                        cases, in which the property of American citizens in China
                                        has been injured, maintains that there is a reciprocal
                                        obligation on the part of the United States to indemnify the
                                        Chinese subjects who were injured at Rock Springs, it
                                        becomes necessary to refute this argument, and most
                                        emphatically to deny the conclusions which the minister
                                        seeks to reach with respect to the existence of similar
                                        responsibility and to the right of the Chinese Government to
                                        insist upon it.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that a
                            number of Yuma Indians, whose names appear in the annexed list of the
                            Fort Yuma Reservation in California have crossed into Mexican territory
                            and established themselves on the ranch called “Algodones,” situated in
                            the territory of Lower California, and owned by Señor Don Guillermo
                            Andrade, without the consent of the latter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. W. C. Hefferman, a superintendent in the Indian school service,
                            informed Señor Andrade that the said Yuma Indians had quitted the
                            territory of the United States because they did not like the present
                            agent in the reservation, and because they did not wish to send their
                            children to the school; but that in distributing the lands of the Fort
                                <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0423"/>Yuma Reservation among the
                            Indians of that tribe those who are now on the Algodones ranch had made
                            application for their share, which indicates that they purpose to keep
                            their position in the United States.</p>
                        <p>In view of this Señor Andrade applied to the Government of Mexico,
                            praying that the aforesaid Indians be expelled from his lands by force,
                            and before giving orders to that end the Government of Mexico desires to
                            know whether, in virtue of the jurisdiction which the Government of the
                            United States exercises over the Indians, it could make them return to
                            the Yuma Reservation, since in case this can not be done the Government
                            of Mexico would have to use force to eject them from the lands they are
                            unrightfully occupying.</p>

                                early report, of a communication from the Secretary of State, dated
                                March 5, inclosing a note of March 1 from. Mr. Romero, the Mexican
                                minister at this capital, informing him that a number of Yuma
                                Indians, belonging to the Yuma Reservation in California, have
                                crossed into Mexican territory and established themselves on the
                                ranch called “Algodones,” situated in the territory of Lower
                                California, and owned by Señor Don Guillermo Andrade, without the
                                consent of the latter; that Mr. W. C. Hefferman, a superintendent in
                                the Indian-school service, informed Señor Andrade that the said Yuma
                                Indians had quitted the United States because they did not wish to
                                send their children to school, but that in allotting the lands of
                                the Yuma Reservation the Indians now on the Algodones ranch made
                                application for their share, which indicates a purpose to retain
                                their status in the United States; that Señor Andrade applied to the
                                Government of Mexico to have the said Indians expelled from his land
                                by force, but before giving orders to that end the Government
                                desires to know whether the United States Government can compel them
                                to return to the Yuma Reservation. Mr. Romero incloses a list of the
                                names of these Indians—39 in number.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to report that heretofore it has been found
                                impracticable, if not impossible, to return Indians to and confine
                                them upon a reservation against their will, without keeping them in
                                actual confinement under guard, and for this there is no authority
                                of law. Local authorities in this country have reported unlawful
                                settlements by Indians and they have been uniformly advised of the
                                difficulty of keeping Indians on a reservation, and that as they
                                were amenable to the local police laws, they should be punished for
                                any violations thereof.</p>
                            <p>In appreciation, however, of the courteous action of the Mexican
                                Government in calling our attention to this trespass, I have, by
                                letter of this date, instructed the United States Indian Agent,
                                Mission Agency, California, within whose jurisdiction the Yuma
                                Indians of California are located, to proceed at once to Mr.
                                Andrade’s premises, in Mexico, and use every legitimate means in his
                                power to induce the trespassers to return to their reservation, or,
                                failing in that, to at least effect their removal from the Territory
                                or Lower California. Should he also fail in this effort this office
                                will, upon receipt of his report to that effect, submit such
                                suggestions for the consideration of the Mexican Government as the
                                facts found may appear to warrant.</p>
                            <p>Very respectfully, etc.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In connection with the Department’s note
                            of March 5, last in reply to yours of the 1st of the same month,
                            touching the alleged illegal occupancy of certain lands in Lower
                            California, owned by Señor Don Guillermo Andrade, by a number of Indians
                            said to belong to the Yuma Reservation, and the desire of the Mexican
                            Government to have them removed to the United States, I have the honor
                            to inclose herewith copy of a report of the Acting Commissioner of
                            Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior, to whom the matter had
                            been referred for investigation.</p>
                        <p>It will be seen therefrom that the case does not come within the purview
                            of the provisions of the extradition treaty of 1861, and that no demand
                            on the part of this Government for the return of these absentee Indians
                            seems warrantable, unless they are charged with some crime, as provided
                            in said treaty. On the other hand, if the Government of Mexico insists
                            upon removing them from its territory, this Government will be prepared
                            to receive them in the manner suggested in the report of the Acting
                            Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and will make every proper and lawful
                            effort to induce them to remain within the territorial jurisdiction of
                            the United States.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On March 10 last this office submitted
                                a report to the Department in the matter of the alleged illegal
                                occupancy of certain lands in Lower California by a number of
                                Indians said to belong upon the Yuma <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0426"/>Reservation in California. The matter was brought
                                to the attention of the State Department by Mr. Romero, the Mexican
                                minister at this capital, and in the said office report of March 10
                                it was stated that the United States Indian agent, Mission Agency,
                                Cal., was directed by letter of that date to proceed at once to the
                                premises occupied by the Indians and use every legitimate means in
                                his power to induce the trespassers to return to their reservation;
                                or, failing in that, to at least effect their removal from the
                                territory of Lower California, and to make prompt report
                                thereon.</p>
                            <p>The said office report concluded with the statement that should the
                                agent fail in his effort to secure removal, this office would, upon
                                receipt of his report to that effect, submit such suggestions for
                                the consideration of the Mexican Government as the facts found might
                                appear to warrant.</p>
                            <p>I am now in receipt of a report from Agent Estudillo, dated April 12,
                                in which he states that he met and talked with the Indians in
                                question through an interpreter in the presence of Judge Christena
                                Fonseca, Jose Bustamenta Jendame, and Jesus Garcia Rural, of Lower
                                California; that he found that they have lived where they now are
                                for ages; that they never knew any difference as to what Government
                                owned the country; that it was always theirs, and is theirs yet;
                                that they showed him commissions given to them by Governor
                                Sanguines, (?) of Encenada, Lower California, which are several
                                years old, and they concluded by refusing to leave their native land
                                and remove to American soil.</p>
                            <p>The agent further reports that while these Indians are doubtless
                                Yumas they have lived on the Colorado River without reference as to
                                what Government they were under or answerable to for many years, and
                                he can not see that anything can be done further than to let them
                                remain where they now are.</p>
                            <p>For the purpose of securing further information in the matter the
                                papers were referred April 24 to Miss Mary O’Neil, superintendent
                                Fort Yuma School, for investigation and report.</p>
                            <p>Under date of May 1 Miss O’Neil reports that the Indians
                                unquestionably belong in this country, and suggests that if they be
                                put across the boundary by the Mexican authorities the Indian police
                                can handle them on this side.</p>
                            <p>It being found that the Indians refuse to voluntarily return to this
                                country the question presents itself as to how their removal from
                                Mexican territory can best be effected, provided of course that the
                                Mexican Government shall insist upon their entire removal from the
                                country, and not merely from the Algodones ranch, upon which they
                                are located.</p>
                            <p>The case does not appear to be one covered by the provisions of the
                                extradition treaty with the Republic of Mexico proclaimed by the
                                President December 11, 1861 (12 U. S. Statutes at Large, 1199),
                                unless the Indians shall be charged with some crime, as provided in
                                said treaty.</p>
                            <p>Their condition appears to be similar in some respects to that of a
                                number of British Cree Indian refugees from the Dominion of Canada,
                                who are thought to have been implicated in what was known as the
                                Riel rebellion during the year 1885, and who settled upon land in
                                this country.</p>
                            <p>October 6, 1885, certain reports respecting the matter were
                                transmitted by this office to the Department with recommendation
                                that the subject be referred to the Department of State with request
                                that arrangements be made with the Dominion authorities for the
                                return of the fugitives to the British territory.</p>
                            <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0427"/>
                            <p>October 13, 1885, the Secretary of State replied, in a letter
                                addressed to the Department, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>* * * On the state of facts shown by your letter and its
                                        inclosures, I beg to say that unless there should be a
                                        specific demand from the Dominion authorities, such demand
                                        being good under the extradition treaty and followed by a
                                        warrant of surrender, the Indians in question can not be
                                        returned by us to Canada, nor can the United States
                                        authorities, military or civil, properly connive at their
                                        being kidnapped and sent over the line. If, however, there
                                        is satisfactory proof that a demand is coming in due form,
                                        they can be arrested to await such demand. If they are
                                        guilty of offenses within the jurisdiction of the United
                                        States, they can be proceeded against for such offenses; but
                                        they can not be prosecuted in our courts or before our
                                        military tribunals for offenses committed in the Dominion of
                                        Canada.</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>Although the British Cree Indians were alleged to be criminals, no
                                demand appears to have been made by the Dominion of Canada for their
                                extradition. They were found to be well behaved and law-abiding, and
                                this Government not only permitted them to remain for a number of
                                years but fed them while they were in destitute condition.</p>
                            <p>It appears, however, that in April, 1892, the Canadian government
                                expressed a willingness to take these Indians back, provided they
                                were taken to the border by the authorities of this country; but
                                they continued to remain until the summer of 1896, when they were
                                removed to the boundary line and delivered to the Canadian
                                authorities under the act of Congress approved May 13, 1896, which
                                appropriated the sum of $5,000 to defray the expense of such
                                removal. (29 Stats., 117.)</p>
                            <p>In 1862, when a portion of the Sioux tribe fled to Canada after the
                                Indian massacre in Minnesota, the Canadian government assigned them
                                to a reservation within her territory, and while since then she has
                                endeavored to persuade them to turn to the United States, they still
                                continue to occupy, with the consent of that government, the
                                reservation set apart for them. I allude to the British Cree and
                                refugee Sioux incidents to show the action of the two governments in
                                dealing with these unfortunate people.</p>
                            <p>No demand was made by the Government in either case for their return.
                                No demand is made by this Government for the return of the refugees,
                                or more properly stated, the absentee Yumas, by the Government of
                                Mexico. They are, however, entirely welcome to a home in this
                                country, and upon their return they will receive the same care and
                                attention that is given their brethren. But their evident preference
                                for Mexico is the obstacle that will make their retention in this
                                country, if returned, a matter of difficulty.</p>
                            <p>If, therefore, the Government of Mexico insists upon removing them
                                from her territory, I can only suggest that they be carried to the
                                border line and delivered to the Indian police of the Yuma
                                Reservation. This being done, every proper and lawful effort will be
                                made to induce them to remain. But if, despite such efforts on the
                                part of the Government, they persist in returning to Mexican soil,
                                and the Government of that Republic will not permit them to occupy a
                                tract of unappropriated land by sufferance, there will probably be
                                no consideration other than that of humane regard for their
                                condition that will prevent the Government dealing with them as
                                trespassers as provided by the laws of Mexico relating to
                                trespass.</p>

                            <p>I had previously notified the Indians to meet me on a given day at
                                the house of the judge.</p>
                            <p>Upon my arrival I found all awaiting me except a few Indians and the
                                judge, who had gone to Ensenada, Lower California, for the purpose
                                of seeing the governor.</p>
                            <p>I conversed with the Indians through an interpreter in the presence
                                of Judge Christena Fonseca, second judge; José Bustamenda Juidame,
                                and Jesus Garcia Rural, of Lower California.</p>
                            <p>I found the Indians opposed to leaving their old homes. They claim
                                that they have lived where they now live for ages; that they never
                                knew any difference as to what Government owned the country; that it
                                was always theirs, and is theirs yet.</p>
                            <p>They showed me commissions given them by Governor Sanquenees, of
                                Ensenada, Lower California, which are several years old. They
                                coincided on refusing to leave their native land and remove to
                                American soil. While these Indians are Yumas, no doubt they have
                                lived on the Colorado River, without reference as to what Government
                                they were under or answerable to, for many years. I can not see that
                                anything can be done further than to let them remain as they are and
                                where they are.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to Department’s No. 356, of the
                            10th instant, relative to the imprisonment of the American citizen, R.
                            H. Doane, in Monclova, Mexico, I have the honor to state that in
                            obedience to your instructions I addressed a note to the foreign office
                            here, calling its attention to the failure of the judge to reply to the
                            perfectly proper inquiry made of him by the consul for information in
                            the case.</p>
                        <p>Replying to my note Mr. Mariscal states that he would obtain from the
                            governor of the State of Coahuila a report as to the status of the case
                            of Doane, and would inform this legation of the result.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mariscal, it will be observed, adds that the mere fact that the judge
                            did not give any answer to the consul’s inquiry does not justify any
                            complaint against the official conduct of the judge, because Mexican
                            judges are not compelled to give foreign consuls any information, nor
                            have the latter the right to ask it, pursuant to Mexican consular
                            law.</p>
                        <p>On receipt of further information about the Doane case I will report to
                            the Department.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Chargé d’affaires</hi>: I have received your
                                note of to-day’s date, in which you set forth that Mr. R. H. Doane,
                                who claims to be an American citizen, was arrested in the month of
                                December, 1896, at Monclova, State of Coahuila, under the accusation
                                of complicity in a robbery, and that in March of the current year
                                the consul of the United States at Piedras Negras addressed two
                                communications to the judge of that place, asking him for
                                information as to Doane’s case, and that he received no answer, to
                                which fact you call this department’s attention under instructions
                                from the Department of State.</p>
                            <p>In answer I have the honor to inform you that the governor of the
                                State of Coahuila will be asked to report as to the status of the
                                proceedings in the case of Doane, so as to communicate the same to
                                that legation. I must observe, however, that the simple fact that
                                the judge did not answer the questions which the consul might have
                                made in his letters does not justify any complaint against the
                                official conduct of said judge, for the reason that the Mexican
                                judges are not obliged to give any information to foreign consuls,
                                neither have the latter a right to ask it, as may be seen in the law
                                of the 26th of November, 1859, which is always sent to said
                                officials when they are furnished with their exequatur.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            No. 268, of the 23d ultimo, inclosing copy of a note from the Mexican
                            foreign-office, stating that while the governor of Coahuila has been
                            called on for a report in the case of R. H. Doane, under arrest on the
                            charge of complicity in a robbery, the consul of the United States at
                            Piedras Negras has no ground for complaint against the judge at that
                            place for not answering two of his communications asking information as
                            to Doane’s ease, because, by the Mexican consular law, judges are not
                            obliged to give such information to foreign consuls, nor have the latter
                            the right to request it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mariscal’s language is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Mexican judges are not obliged to give any information to
                                    foreign consuls, neither have the latter a right to ask it, as
                                    may be seen in the law of 26th November, 1859, which is always
                                    sent to said officials when they are furnished with their
                                    exequaturs.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The law in question has been carefully examined by the Department, but it
                            does not find in it any prohibition forbidding in express terms a consul
                            to ask information of a judge in regard to the course of a criminal case
                            affecting an American citizen.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>Article 10, section 2, gives the consuls the right to offer to a
                                judge information touching a case so pending, providing the consul
                                shall not assume to act as attorney or lawyer for the
                                defendant.</item>
                            <item>Article 12 requires the authorities and public officers of the
                                consular district to “use the same decorum and civility in their
                                replies” to the consuls, and prescribes the way in which the consuls
                                may complain “when they think that their official actions do not
                                receive due attention.” This certainly seems to contemplate a civil
                                and decorous reply on the part of a judge to a consular request for
                                information, even should the reply deny the consul’s right to ask
                                it. It surely does not appear to absolve the judge from all
                                obligation to reply, as Mr. Mariscal maintains.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Mexican law, therefore, at most only excludes by omission the right
                            of a consul to request proper information in regard to a pending case
                            affecting one of his countrymen.</p>
                        <p>Such inquiries are usual in the consular intercourse of nations. They are
                            often made by our consuls under express instruction from the Secretary
                            of State.</p>
                        <p>The Department is perfectly aware that the proceedings of first instance,
                            under the general code of the countries deriving their procedure from
                            the Roman law, are analogous in their nature to the inquest of a grand
                            jury under the common law of Saxon nations, and that precise information
                            in respect to and formulation of the charges against a prisoner are not
                            communicable in the preliminary stages. But this does not preclude a
                            respectful inquiry from a consul as to the general nature of the offense
                            charged or as to the status of a pending case. To make such an inquiry
                            is deemed by this Government to be one of “the regular good offices
                            which the legitimate interests of their compatriots may demand.” (Law of
                            1859, art. 10, par. 1.) It anticipates a courteous response to such
                            inquires made by its consuls abroad, just as it expects like courteous
                            response by the judicial officers of the United States to the inquiries

                        <p>If the inquiry be not proper, it would seem at least due to ordinary <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0431"/>courtesy that the consul should
                            be advised of the inability of the judge to answer and the reason
                            thereof.</p>
                        <p>This Government has taken this position as to all foreign countries where
                            the case has arisen, and our position has been uniformly recognized as
                            just and proper. It can not yield this ground in our consular
                            intercourse with Mexico without acquiescing in a marked exception to the
                            usage which obtains elsewhere.</p>

                                excellency’s note of the 15th ultimo, with copy of a communication
                                from the Secretary of State of the United States in relation to the
                                fact that the judge of Monclova had not replied to two letters sent
                                him by the American consul at Piedras Negras, asking information
                                regarding the arrest and imprisonment of R. H. Doane, accused of
                                complicity in the robbing of the express office in the railway
                                station in the city of Monclova.</p>
                            <p>In reply I have the honor to say that the authorities of the Republic
                                can not recognize in consular agents faculties not expressed in the
                                laws that define their attributes, as in the following case.</p>
                            <p>Therefore this department does not consider that the judge of
                                Monclova has incurred any official responsibility in not replying to
                                the letters addressed to him by the consul at Piedras Negras.
                                However, the fact that the judge did not reply to the two letters
                                mentioned should be considered a mere lack of social courtesy,
                                aggravated by the official position occupied by the commercial agent
                                of a friendly government; and in this light the governor of the
                                State of Coahuila has been requested to charge the said functionary
                                with the performance of that social duty.</p>
                            <p>I renew, etc.</p>

                            Commission of Mexico and the United States, created by the convention of
                            July 29, 1882, to replace the monuments marking the dividing line from
                            Paso del Norte to the Pacific Ocean, noticed in the execution of its
                            labors considerable differences between the dividing line agreed upon in
                            the treaty of December 30, 1855, and that laid off on the spot by the
                            respective commissions which were at work up to the year 1856,
                            especially in the measurement of 100 miles along parallel 31° 47′ north
                            latitude, from the River Bravo west, and thence south until striking
                            parallel 31° 20′, and following <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0433"/>that parallel to the west to the meridian 111° west of Greenwich. The
                            progress of science, the perfection of scientific instruments, and the
                            use of the telegraph enabled this commission to discover the mistakes of
                            the first.</p>
                        <p>As it is proper that the demarcation of the dividing line on the ground
                            should be in conformity with the provisions of the treaty in question,
                            the Mexican Government thinks that the line should be rectified so as to
                            agree with the treaty which fixed it, and to prevent either of the
                            contracting countries being in possession, although by mistake, of
                            portions of territory which it was not the intention of the treaty to
                            grant it.</p>
                        <p>To this end the Mexican Government has instructed me to propose to the
                            United States Government the conclusion of a new convention to rectify
                            the demarcation of the dividing line in accordance with the treaty of
                            1853, between the River Bravo (monument No. 1) and the Colorado River
                            (monument No. 205), or throughout its whole extent, if the United States
                            Government should prefer to have the rectification made along the whole
                            line, although the differences found in the dividing line between the
                            Californias are insignificant.</p>
                        <p>If the United States Government considers these observations well
                            founded, and if you desire it, I will draw up a draft of a convention
                            for the exact demarcation of the dividing line throughout its whole
                            extent, or in the part mentioned.</p>

                            commission of 1853–1856, and the other determined in 1891–1895 by the
                            commission organized pursuant to the convention of 1882, but to submit a
                            few observations as to the propriety of reopening the question for the
                            purpose of correcting certain errors made by the first commission.</p>
                        <p>As to the first point, Colonel Barlow, to whom the matter was referred,
                            and who was the engineer in chief of the United States of the last
                            commission, has this to say: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Without going into minute details, all of which are specifically
                                    given in the report of the commission, it may he stated that two
                                    quite important errors in the original survey were noticed:</p>
                                <p>First. A mistake in the measurement of the section along parallel
                                    31° 47′, west <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0434"/>from the
                                    Rio Grande. This distance was found to be 159,193.4 meters
                                    instead of 160,933.0 meters (100 miles) as prescribed by the
                                    treaty. As a result of this error the meridian section
                                    connecting the parallel of 31° 47′ with the parallel of 31° 20′
                                    was located approximately 1 mile (1,739.6 meters) east of its
                                    proper position, thus giving to the United States a strip of
                                    land about 31 miles long from north to south by about 1 mile in
                                    width, which was not intended by the treaty. The present
                                    Commissioners are very confident in regard to the accuracy of
                                    their determination of this length, as four independent
                                    measurements of this section were made as follows:</p>
                                <p>By the United States Commission: (1) A measurement by chain; (2)
                                    a measurement by stadia; (3) a measurement by telegraphic
                                    exchange of local time.</p>
                                <p>By the Mexican Commission: (4) A measurement by stadia.</p>
                                <p>These four measurements agreed within small limits, and by mutual
                                    consent the astronomical determination was adopted.</p>
                                <p>Second. The longitude of the monument marking the western
                                    terminus of the section along parallel 31° 20′, which should
                                    have been at the one hundred and eleventh meridian, was found by
                                    our determination, both by stadia measurements carried forward
                                    independently by the United States and Mexican parties, and also
                                    from telegraphic determination of longitude, to be in longitude
                                    111° 4′ 34.45″, about 4½ miles west of its proper position. This
                                    error was also favorable to the United States as a triangular
                                    area, of which one side is 4½ miles on the parallel, the other
                                    two sides being the lines connecting the extremities of this
                                    short line with a point on the Colorado River, about 234 miles
                                    distant. This area is not an exact triangle, as the original
                                    error in longitude gave rise to corresponding errors in azimuth,
                                    which caused the resulting boundary to deviate from its true
                                    character, and as this line was not carried all the way to the
                                    Colorado River, but was joined to one which had previously been
                                    ran eastward from the required point on the river, this
                                    deviation was not then noticed.</p>
                                <p>The number of square miles of land of which Mexico was deprived
                                    by these errors is approximately as follows: <table rows="3" cols="2">

                                <p>No other error of importance was noticed; the determinations for
                                    latitude along the two sections upon the parallels by the two
                                    commissions agreed within reasonable limits. Nor is it at all
                                    remarkable that the longitudes of the early commission should
                                    have differed from ours to the extent noticed, when it is
                                    considered that the state of the country at that time, owing to
                                    lack of supplies, and the presence of hostile Indians rendered a
                                    continuous measurement of the line impracticable, and, without
                                    the aid of the telegraph, the accurate determination of
                                    astronomical longitude was well nigh impossible.</p>
                                <p>The present commissioners can testify to the general excellence
                                    of the former work, and are of the opinion that, taking into
                                    consideration the difficulties then existing, no better results
                                    than were attained could have been expected. Indeed, the final
                                    difference in longitude between the Rio Grande and the Pacific
                                    coast as determined by that commission differs only from that
                                    determined by the latter and more precise method by about 1.6
                                    miles.</p>

                        <p>As to the question of a new convention for the rectification of the
                            boundary in accordance with the treaty of December, 1853, I may say in
                            all candor, in which the interests of both Governments are to be
                            considered in forming a conclusion, that it is one of propriety. I shall
                            endeavor to be as explicit as possible and am indebted to Colonel Barlow
                            for some data on which to found a reply to that particular part of your
                            proposition.</p>
                        <p>Article I of the treaty of December, 1853, states: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>That line shall be alone established upon which the commission
                                    may fix, their consent in this particular being considered
                                    decisive and an integral part of this treaty, without necessity
                                    of ulterior ratification or approval, and without room for
                                    interpretation of any kind, by either of the parties
                                    contracting.</p>
                                <p>The dividing line thus established shall, in all time, be
                                    faithfully respected by the two governments without any
                                    variation therein, unless of the express and free consent of the
                                    two, given in conformity to the principles of the law of
                                    nations, and in accordance with the constitution of each
                                    country, respectively.</p>

                        <p>Great stress seems to have been laid upon the importance of a final and
                            permanent settlement of the boundary which shall in all time be
                            faithfully respected by the two Governments. * * *</p>
                        <p>The delimitation by that commission was made an explicit part of the
                            treaty, and it would seem that the line thus established should not be
                            changed except for very weighty and serious reasons. It is questionable
                            if the transfer of a comparatively few square miles of land, then
                            practically valueless, and now of but small intrinsic worth, can be
                            considered a sufficient reason to disturb the satisfactory condition
                            that exists on the frontier and give occasion for all sorts of private
                            claims for damages on the part of the owners of adjacent lands. As has
                            been previously remarked, these lands are generally of little value, but
                            it is natural to suppose that should any chance arise by which the
                            owners could bring claims against either Government, it is difficult to
                            foretell how much their value would increase by reason of such claims.
                            The people on the border are, so far as is known, entirely satisfied
                            with the line as now marked. To change it would, I feel convinced, give
                            rise to much dissatisfaction. None of the land in question can be said
                            to be agricultural. The area of 30 square miles along the meridian
                            section is a cattle range. A portion at the northern end has been
                            carefully prospected for minerals. At present I am advised these
                            prospects are all abandoned, the ore found being of low grade, not worth
                            the cost of mining.</p>
                        <p>The section along the azimuth line west of the one hundred and eleventh
                            meridian is much less valuable, nearly the whole tract being a hopeless
                            desert; a region of sand plains and rocky, barren ridges. At the eastern
                            end, in the Pajaritos Mountains, there are some mining claims, a few of
                            which were, it was ascertained, being worked at the time of the recent
                            survey, but it was not learned that these enterprises were profitable.
                            West of these mountains a few cattle ranches have been located, but the
                            scarcity of both grass and water renders the business exceedingly
                            precarious. Beyond these ranches the country is almost without
                            inhabitants; one or two Mexican families and a few Indians constitute
                            the total population in the vicinity of the boundary for a distance of
                            about 200 miles between the Pozo Verde Mountains and the Colorado
                            River.</p>
                        <p>It would seem, in the Department’s judgment, that all the purposes of the
                            several treaties have been subserved; a boundary was established and
                            marked, in compliance with the treaty of 1853, which has been known and
                            accepted by both Governments as well as the people living along the
                            border. It is true this line may perhaps have been inadequately marked
                            at first, and several of the marks may have disappeared, but its
                            approximate location was recognized, and private rights were acquired in
                            accordance with its location. In compliance with the treaties of 1882
                            and 1889 this boundary was reestablished and carefully marked, and, as
                            such, is apparently satisfactory to the people in its vicinity. The
                            monuments as now located are permanent and intervisible; no dispute can
                            arise in regard to the boundary, which is practically the same that has
                            been known and recognized during the preceding forty years. It would
                            seem, therefore, a useless refinement to change it now. The matter at
                            issue, so far as the two Governments are concerned, it is respectfully
                            submitted, is but a trifle, while to the individuals to be affected the
                            results of a change might be very serious.</p>
                        <p>While the work proposed, should it ultimately be determined to make <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0436"/>the rectification referred to,
                            would not be specially difficult and would involve no very intricate
                            scientific problems, yet the more serious and expensive part of it would
                            doubtless be the removal and reerection of all monuments along the
                            meridian section, 14 in number, three being of stone; also those on. the
                            azimuth line from the one hundred and eleventh meridian to the Colorado
                            River, 80 in number, 10 being of stone. Apparently the request of the
                            Mexican Government contemplates the rectification of the whole line from
                            the Rio Grande to the Colorado, involving the removal of 205 monuments,
                            although in this connection I have observed your statement that “the
                            differences found in the dividing line between the Californias are
                            insignificant.” Still, as there are some deviations on the California
                            azimuth line, it would seem proper to include that section also if the
                            work is to be undertaken.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, it is well to bear in mind that all surveys, even
                            when carried out with the greatest precision, are necessarily
                            approximate. There is therefore no reason to believe that the survey of
                            the commission of 1891–1895 was infallible, or that should the line be
                            now changed to conform to its results a future generation would be
                            equally justified in changing it again on the plea that a further
                            advance in scientific methods had discovered errors in the present
                            work.</p>
                        <p>I submit these views for the information of the Mexican Government. In
                            the President’s judgment no sufficient reasons have been adduced why
                            either Government should be put to the expense of endeavoring to rectify
                            a line, that future generations may be able to say is not the true one,
                            after it has been so thoroughly and competently surveyed, in the light
                            of all modern and scientific methods, by the joint commission organized
                            pursuant to the convention of July 29, 1882. The results of that
                            commission should stand, since the differences indicated are of
                            practically no intrinsic value so far as the few square miles of land
                            are concerned, and the boundary line so marked is practically the same
                            that had been known and recognized during the preceding forty years.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: This legation, in its notes of
                            July 17, 1893, and May 22, 1894, requested of your Department the
                            extradition of Ines Ruiz, Jesus Guerra, and Juan Duque, guilty of the
                            crimes of murder, robbery, arson, and plagio, committed in the town of
                            San Ignacio, State of Tamaulipas, Mexico, on December 10, 1892. The
                            appropriate judicial proceedings being held in the United States circuit
                            court for the western district of Texas, Commissioner L, F. Price
                            adjudged the evidence against Ruiz, Guerra, and Duque legally sufficient
                            and valid, and that, being guilty of those crimes, they should be held
                            as prisoners to await the determination of the President of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>In its note of July 9, 1894, your Department informed this legation that
                            Ines Ruiz and Jesus Guerra, having appealed to a court of the United
                            States for a writ of habeas corpus, it considered itself compelled to
                            postpone its decision regarding the request for the extradition of these
                            persons until the court should decide upon this appeal. Judge Maxey, of
                            the United States district court for the western district of Texas,
                            granted the appeal for habeas corpus for Jesus Guerra, as well as for
                            Ines Ruiz and Juan Duque, but this decision having been appealed from
                            the Supreme Court of the United States, the latter tribunal, by its
                            decision of March 16, 1896, reversed that of Judge Maxey on the ground
                            that Commissioner Price having had jurisdiction there was no room for an
                            appeal for habeas corpus, for which cause your Department on the 9th of
                            July, 1896, ordered the surrender of Ines Ruiz and Juan Duque.</p>
                        <p>Having received this day notice that Sheriff Shely, of Starr County,
                            Tex., has apprehended Jesus Guerra and handed him over to the United
                            States marshal, and the legal requirements relating to the extradition
                            of this person and his surrender to the Mexican authorities according to
                            the treaty of extradition between the two countries having been all
                            fulfilled before Commissioner Price, I beg you to be pleased to obtain
                            and transmit the necessary warrant for the surrender by the respective
                            functionaries of this country of Jesus Guerra.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of the 28th September, requesting the issuance of a
                            warrant for the surrender to Mexico of Jesus Guerra, charged with the
                            commission of certain crimes growing out of an attack by an armed
                            expedition upon San Ignacio, Mexico.</p>
                        <p>After mature and careful consideration of the evidence adduced in the
                            case before the extradition commissioner at San Antonio, I have the
                            honor to inform you that this Department can find no sufficient ground
                            on which to grant the extradition. From an attentive reading of that
                            evidence it appears that Guerra was a member of the expedition making
                            the attack, but it does not appear that he is implicated, either as an a
                            better or participant, in the commission of any offense against private
                            parties. Therefore he is not deemed culpable for those offenses
                            committed without his privity; and as the evidence shows the expedition
                            to have been revolutionary in its origin and purpose, the offense of
                            being a member thereof was of a purely political character, outside of
                            the purview of the extradition treaty between the United States and
                            Mexico.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have the honor to-day of
                            receiving your communication No. 295 of the 13th instant, in which you
                            tell me, in answer to the one I sent you the 28th of September, asking
                            for the extradition of Jesus Guerra, accused of crimes committed in the
                            assault at San Ignacio, Mexico, that, according to the evidence
                            presented in this case before the extradition commission at San Antonio,
                            the Department has not found reason for granting the extradition; that
                            said evidence shows that Guerra was a member of the expedition that
                            perpetrated the assault at San Ignacio, but that it does not appear that
                            Guerra took part as an author or accomplice in the commission of
                            offenses against individuals, and consequently should not be considered
                            responsible for offenses in which it is not proven that he directly
                            participated; and that since the said evidence shows that the assault
                            was revolutionary in its origin and object, crimes committed by a member
                            of the expedition are of a purely political nature, and, in consequence,
                            excepted from extradition, in conformity with the treaty between Mexico
                            and the United States.</p>
                        <p>I can not refrain from expressing, Mr. Secretary, my regret at seeing
                            that you have reversed the decisions given by your two predecessors in
                            the high post that you occupy. Permit me to recall to you that the Hon.
                            Walter Q. Gresham, Secretary of State of the United States, decided in a
                            communication addressed to this legation on April 6, 1893, following the
                            opinion of the then Solicitor of the Department of State, that the
                            assault at San Ignacio, committed December 10, 1892, by a party of
                            bandits organized in Texas to commit depredations against <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0441"/>persons and property in Mexico, was of
                            a political character; but in view of the observations made to him, in a
                            communication of this legation dated April 7, 1893, and in a conference
                            between us in the presence of the Solicitor of the Department, he became
                            convinced that the said assault was not of a character purely political,
                            of the nature to warrant its exception from extradition by the treaty of
                            December 11, 1861, and revoked his decision in a letter of May 13, 1893.
                            I think it proper to subjoin the account given by the said Secretary of
                            State in this letter of the assault at San Ignacio, and of the reasons
                            on which he relied in deciding that this assault was not of a purely
                            political character.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Benavides was in charge of a party of bandits, numbering some 150,
                                who on December 10 last passed over the Rio Grande from Texas into
                                Mexico and assaulted a Mexican garrison of about 40 men stationed at
                                San Ignacio, a ranch immediately on the Mexican border of the river.
                                A number of the garrison were killed, a number wounded, and all the
                                survivors made prisoners by the bandits. Benavides himself proposed
                                that the prisoners be shot, but his purpose was frustrated, or at
                                least not executed, and the members of the garrison who had been
                                taken prisoners were released on the Mexican side of the river.</p>
                            <p>Several private citizens, noncombatants, were violently assaulted,
                                but none were killed. All the horses of the garrison were taken by
                                the bandits, and at least two belonging to private citizens. Several
                                small sums of money were taken from women. The supplies and
                                equipments of the garrison were also taken.</p>
                            <p>It further appears that the bandits, in the course of the assault
                                upon the garrison, fired the barracks and also burned some buildings
                                belonging to private parties.</p>
                            <p>The idea that these acts were perpetrated with bona fide political or
                                revolutionary design is negatived by the fact that immediately after
                                their occurrence, though no superior armed force of the Mexican
                                Government was in the vicinity to hinder their advance into the
                                country, the bandits withdrew with their booty across the river into
                                Texas.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>In view of this decision the Mexican consul at San Antonio, Tex., began
                            proceedings for extradition, among the other bandits who composed the
                            company of Benavides, of Ines Ruiz, Jesus Guerra, and Juan Duque, and
                            the commissioner, L. F. Price, decided that the evidence presented
                            against these three prisoners was enough, according to the law, to
                            consider them guilty of the said offenses, and declared that they should
                            be retained in confinement awaiting the decision of the President of the
                            United States. The accused then had recourse to habeas corpus before the
                            Federal court of the western district of Texas, which granted it, giving
                            as reason that the assault at San Ignacio was an offense of a political
                            character. The Mexican consul at San Antonio, considering this decision
                            unfounded, appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States from the
                            sentence of Judge Maxey, and that high tribunal, in a decision of March
                            16, 1896, revoked the decision of Judge Maxey, asserting that, since
                            Commissioner Price had had jurisdiction, recourse to habeas corpus could
                            not be had, and that the offenses of which Inez Ruiz, Jesus Guerra, and
                            Juan Duque were of a common order and not of a purely political
                            character. I think it proper to quote the following extracts from the
                            decision of the Supreme Court: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    and so was induced to substitute his judgment for that of the
                                    commissioner, in whom was reposed the authority of decision,
                                    unless jurisdiction was lacking.</p>
                                <p>Can it be said that the commissioner had no choice on the
                                    evidence but to hold, in view of the character of the foray, the
                                    mode of attack, the persons killed or captured, and the kind of
                                    property taken or destroyed, that this was a movement in aid of
                                    a political revolt, an insurrection, or a civil war, and that
                                    acts which contained all the characteristics of crimes under the
                                    ordinary law were exempt from extradition because of the
                                    political intentions of those who committed them? In our opinion
                                    this inquiry must be answered in the negative.</p>

                        <p>The sentence of Judge Maxey having thus been revoked, the Mexican
                            Government again asked, through a letter from this legation sent to the
                            Department on the 18th of March, 1896, the extradition of Inez Ruiz,
                            Jesus Guerra, and Juan Duque, and on receiving advices of the arrest of
                            Ruiz and Duque the legation asked for their delivery, in letters dated
                            May 21 and July 2, 1896, respectively. The Hon. Richard Olney, Secretary
                            of State of the United States, successor of Mr. Gresham, granted that of
                            Inez Ruiz and Juan Duque, sending to this legation the orders for their
                            delivery, with letters Nos. 137 and 138 of July 9, 1896. The delivery of
                            Jesus Guerra was not insisted upon, because he had fled; but on
                            receiving notice of his arrest I sent you the letter of September
                            28.</p>
                        <p>It appears from the above that your two predecessors as Secretary of
                            State and the Supreme Court of the United States decided that the
                            assault at San Ignacio was not an offense of purely political character.
                            You now inform me that the evidence shows that the assault was
                            revolutionary in its origin and purpose, and that consequently its
                            character was purely political; and this decision, which is contrary to
                            that expressed by your two predecessors and by the Supreme Court,
                            reverses the decisions granted by them after mature consideration.</p>
                        <p>If the assault on San Ignacio was not of a purely political nature, as
                            has been recognized by your predecessors and by the Supreme Court, the
                            persons who took part in the same are responsible for the crimes
                            committed, even if they did not personally commit them, inasmuch as the
                            crimes were committed by the organization created by the assailants and
                            in virtue of the direct cooperation of all; although they may not
                            personally have committed them. I therefore think it unnecessary to
                            discuss the point of the direct participation which Guerra may have had
                            in the commission of the crimes, since you have thought it best to
                            revoke the decision of the Department in regard to the true character of
                            the offenses.</p>
                        <p>Before closing I should recall to you that, as I have informed the
                            Department, armed expeditions were organized for three years in Texas to
                            attack the defenseless people of Mexico, with the object of
                            assassination and robbing individuals and of exercising personal
                            vengeance, the chief incitement of such expeditions being the immunity
                            which the said bandits enjoy in the United States, and that from the
                            time that the authors were delivered to the Mexican Government to be
                            tried for actions committed in Mexican territory the expeditions
                            ceased.</p>
                        <p>It is also a fact that the persons delivered to Mexico by the United
                            States Government have been tried with all impartiality by Mexican
                            tribunals, and that in no case has the most severe punishment been
                            decreed.</p>

                            Government to grant the extradition of Jesus Guerra.</p>
                        <p>While it is not the usage of the Department to enter at large into the

                            as well from the sense of respect and deference for your excellency’s
                            wishes and opinions as to exhibit more fully to your excellency’s
                            consideration the reasons on which the decision was reached.</p>
                        <p>While unable perhaps to concur in the correctness of the conclusion
                            reached, nevertheless your excellency will appreciate that the decision
                            was arrived at after a most careful consideration of the premises and
                            was actuated by a spirit of comity and absolute equity.</p>
                        <p>In the communication to your excellency of the ground of the refusal to
                            grant the extradition, the language which was used appears not to have
                            been felicitously chosen, since in your excellency’s communication that
                            reason is stated as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Since the said evidence shows that the assault was revolutionary
                                    in its movement and object, crimes committed by a member of the
                                    expedition are of a purely political nature, and in consequence
                                    exempted from extradition in conformity with the treaty,
                                    etc.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>With your excellency’s permission, I quote the precise language used in
                            the note of the 13th instant, to which the reply was addressed: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>From an attentive reading of that evidence it appears that Guerra
                                    was a member of the expedition making the attack, but it does
                                    not appear that he was implicated either as an abettor or
                                    participant in the commission of any offenses against private
                                    parties. Therefore, he is not culpable for these offenses
                                    committed without his privity, and as the evidence shows the
                                    expedition to have been revolutionary in its origin and purpose,
                                    the offense of being a member thereof was of a purely political
                                    character, outside of the purview of the extradition treaty
                                    between the United States and Mexico.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The discrimination between the decision actually rendered and as
                            indicated in your excellency’s communication more clearly appears by
                            reference to the petition filed before the magistrate for extradition,
                            which charges Guerra with murder, to wit, shooting certain named Mexican
                            officers and soldiers; with arson, to wit, the burning of the barracks;
                            with robbery, to wit, the taking of cavalry horses, etc., with
                            kidnaping, to wit, the taking of Mexican soldiers as prisoners. This is
                            the gravamen of the charge; for while the complaint makes a vague
                            general charge of robbery, it is so vague as not to warrant the
                            detention or extradition of any man.</p>
                        <p>The decision was necessarily based on the complaint made and the evidence
                            adduced in support of it, secundum allegata et probata. The ground of
                            the decision, and what actually was decided, was that the evidence shows
                            that the assault was revolutionary in its origin and object, and that
                            the aforesaid acts, which were in aid thereof, being incidents of
                            regular military warfare, can not be characterized as common crimes;
                            that they were shown to be committed, not from motives of revenge or
                            pecuniary gain, but for the political one of revolution. The evidence
                            fails to show the presence of a merely criminal motive of the actors,
                            except in so far as it may be inferred from the nature of the acts. But
                            to argue that the acts themselves were intrinsically wicked and
                            therefore demonstrate the presence of the intent characteristic of
                            common crimes would have the effect in all cases of unsuccessful
                            revolutionary movements, conducted by force and bloodshed, to destroy
                            the right of asylum to political offenders and refugees. It was
                            therefore by no means intended to be decided that since the assault was
                            revolutionary, “crimes committed by a member of the expedition are of a
                            purely political character.” The decision was that, as the movement was
                            revolutionary, acts done in aid thereof are not common crimes; and as
                            Guerra was not implicated, either as principal or accessory, in the
                            commission of offenses against private persons, the <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0444"/>guilt of such crimes could not be
                            imputed to him any more than if, during a lawful political assemblage,
                            some one of those present should commit a lawless act could the
                            commission of that offense be imputed to the entire assembly.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency observes that— <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>If the assault on San Ignacio was not of a purely political
                                    nature, * * * the persons who took part in the same are
                                    responsible for the crimes committed, even if they did not
                                    personally commit them, inasmuch as the crimes were committed by
                                    the organization created by the assailants, and in virtue of the
                                    direct cooperation of all, although they may not personally have
                                    committed them.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Without assenting or dissenting from this position in the absence of a
                            distinct understanding of what is meant by the assault being “not of a
                            purely political nature,” it may be observed that if what is meant that
                            when the movement is revolutionary in its origin and object it ceases to
                            be of a purely political character, because lawless acts not germane to
                            the object of the movement may be committed by individuals without
                            authority or privity of their leaders or associates, the contention, if
                            interpreted in that sense, could not be acceded to, since it would be an
                            unwarranted extension of the doctrines of principal and, accessory so as
                            to implicate all political offenders engaged in the same revolutionary
                            movement in the guilt of such acts and render them all common criminals.
                            If it is meant that the expedition had a dual object, to wit, the
                            overthrow of the Mexican Government and the plunder of the Mexican
                            people, the two objects would seem inconsistent, except so far as the
                            overthrow of organized resistance was incidentally necessary to the
                            pursuit of plunder. The evidence wholly fails to show that object; the
                            course pursued by the expedition seems utterly inconsistent with that
                            object, for after the Mexican soldiery had been captured or disabled in
                            battle and all resistance overcome, and San Ignacio and the surrounding
                            country lay at the mercy of Benavides and his followers, and pillage was
                            at length within their easy grasp, the evidence fails to show any
                            attempt to pursue and accomplish the very thing which your excellency
                            deems to have been the main or sole object of the assault.</p>
                        <p>The point on which the decision turns is the question of fact whether the
                            expedition was organized and conducted for the accomplishment of a
                            political object. This question your excellency passed over and conceded
                            that it was partly political by the contention that it was not purely
                            political; and Guerra’s extradition was sought on the assumption of fact
                            that the expedition was either not political or at least was only partly
                            so. And on that assumption guilt was constructively imputed to Guerra
                            for all isolated acts of lawlessness committed by any other individual
                            or group of individuals without his participation, cognizance, or
                            privity. This would seem a dangerous extension of the doctrine of
                            principal and accessory unsupported by any authority, and in the absence
                            of which, or of evidence of his participation in such lawless acts, the
                            ordinary presumption of innocence should prevail. Such is the humanity

                                <p>The political offense for which extradition should never be
                                    granted is the act considered as punishable solely and
                                    exclusively because of its political character. These are
                                    absolute political offenses. The qualification according to
                                    which the offense should be characterized as such and punishable
                                    by similar analogous penalties in the two States will suffice in
                                    the majority of cases to exclude extradition. If offenses which
                                    do not constitute common crimes, exhibiting the gravity just now
                                    characterized, have been committed with a political object, this
                                    object can, in the view of the <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0446"/>impartial and disinterested State, impart to
                                    them a special character different from that which they would
                                    have if they had been committed for the purpose of gain or of
                                    political or private revenge. These are offenses connected with
                                    political offenses, which may thus he called relative-political;
                                    that is, not absolute. They have a political character by reason
                                    of their object, and this political character may suffice to
                                    exclude extradition. We are considering now the political object
                                    which the accused has wished to attain. We are not considering a
                                    political motive; a political motive does not suffice to give to
                                    an offense the political character relieving the requested State
                                    from the duty of extradition. It follows, moreover, from the
                                    very tenor of the most of the extradition treaties, that when
                                    they exclude political offenses, it is precisely connected,
                                    complex, or relative-political offenses which are meant, the
                                    non-extradition for absolute political offenses being considered
                                    as implied. (Rivier, Principles du Droit des Gens, p. 353).</p>

                        <p>Had it not been for the use of the word “purely” in the treaty Guerra was
                            clearly not extraditable, since the evidence adduced by him stood
                            uncontradicted that the object of the expedition was political. Does the
                            term “purely “extend the scope of the right to extradition? According to
                            Rivier it is tacitly implied in all extradition ‘treaties that when they
                            exclude political offenses, connected or complex crimes are not
                            included, since crimes of an absolutely or purely political character
                            are excluded by implication, and the use of the word “purely,”
                            therefore, according to Rivier, would seem not to give any extension to
                            the right of extradition. If, however, it does not give any such
                            extension it must be by construction, since the meaning of the term is
                            not defined by treaty; but the right to personal liberty may not be
                            taken away by mere judicial construction, especially where, in cases of
                            doubt, the obligation of extradition is interpreted in a limitative
                            manner and in favor of the right of asylum.</p>
                        <p>But it not being necessary to decide the question whether or not the word
                            “purely” should be construed to extend the right of extradition between
                            the two Governments, it may be suggested that it receive in this case
                            the construction contended for by your excellency, namely, that a
                            private offense committed by one or a few members of a revolutionary
                            body should be imputed to all the rest of that body, although the rest
                            may not have been in anywise privy to it, it would in effect make all
                            political offenses extraditable, since there perhaps never was a
                            political revolution without some of the elements of lawlessness
                            attending it, even against the will of its leaders. Such construction
                            would also put the ban of the treaty on all political revolutions
                            conducted by force and violence, and subject all engaged in them to
                            extradition for acts done causing bloodshed and the capture of prisoners

                            itself determines what is decided. And what the Supreme Court decided in
                            this case is expressed in the concluding paragraph of its opinion:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>We are of the opinion that it can not he held that there was
                                    substantially no evidence calling for the judgment of the
                                    commissioner as to whether he would, or would not, certify and
                                    commit under the statute, and that therefore, as matter of law,
                                    he had no jurisdiction over the subject-matter; and this being
                                    so, his action was not open to review on habeas corpus. (Ornelas

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>From which it does not seem that the Supreme Court decided “that the
                            assault at San Ignacio was not an offense of a purely political
                            character.” What it did decide was, that there was evidence calling for
                            the decision of the commissioner one way or the other, and that, on the
                            state of the case, the Federal Court could not review his decision. The
                            Supreme Court did not pass upon the weight or probative force of the
                            evidence, nor any portion of it, since according to its own decision it
                            had no authority to do so. I am therefore unable to share the regret
                            expressed by your excellency that the decision of the Supreme Court has
                            been reversed; and whatever regret may be felt at not apparently
                            following the last decision rendered by Secretary Gresham, it is greatly
                            lessened by the consideration that it is in harmony with the first
                            decision rendered by that distinguished Secretary and with the decisions
                            rendered on analogous states of fact by Secretary Bayard in 1887, and by
                            Acting Secretary Hunter in 1880; and, in short, with every decision
                            rendered by this Department since the negotiation of the treaty with
                            Mexico in 1862; and in harmony with the traditionary policy of this
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the point made in conclusion in your excellency’s reply that
                            “armed expeditions were organized for three years in Texas to attack the
                            defenseless people of Mexico,” it may be observed that said
                            consideration would have its appropriate and, doubtless, great weight
                            with the treaty-making power, as such, in the formation of a treaty; but
                            in the execution of the treaty the parties to it are bound by its terms
                            and can not arbitrarily wrest if from its true intent for the
                            accomplishment of political objects foreign thereto, however laudable
                            those objects might be, and that in the absence of a treaty provision
                            for the extradition of political offenders, the neutrality laws afford a
                            remedy for hostile incursions of a political character across the border
                            of the two countries.</p>
                        <p>In reaching this conclusion, the Department wishes to state that this <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0448"/>is a very close case and the
                            decision announced has resolved the doubts in favor of liberty.</p>
                        <p>It is placed upon the distinct ground that as far as Guerra is concerned,
                            whatever others may have done, it does not appear from the testimony
                            that he committed any extraditable offense, and for that reason could
                            not be delivered. The Department is not prepared to say that others may
                            not, in the same expedition, have committed offenses of a character
                            which would warrant their extradition under the terms of the treaty.
                            Should cases arise or further consideration of this matter be asked, the
                            Department is at all times ready to hear any representation your
                            excellency may wish to make, and when consistent with its sense of duty,
                            to accede to the same. The Department feels that no less than this is
                            due to friendly relations with the Government which your excellency
                            represents with so much ability and fidelity at this capital.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have had the honor to receive
                            your note No. 302, bearing date of yesterday, in reply to mine of the
                            15th ultimo, in which I made certain observations in relation to your
                            note No. 295 of the 15th ultimo, in which you decline to grant the
                            extradition of Jesus Guerra, for which the Mexican Government had
                            applied.</p>
                        <p>In the state which this case has now reached, there is nothing for me to
                            do but to send a copy of your note to my Government, in order that, in
                            view thereof, it may reach such decision as it thinks proper.</p>
                        <p>I do not think, nevertheless, that I should allow this occasion to pass
                            without stating that, in my opinion, it can not be doubted that, when
                            the Hon. Richard Olney, your immediate predecessor, granted, by his
                            notes to this legation Nos. 137 and 138, of July 9, 1896, the
                            extradition of Ines Ruiz and Juan Duque, who were guilty of the same
                            crimes with which Jesus Guerra is charged, he admitted that the attack
                            on San Ignacio was not a crime of a merely political character, and
                            that, consequently, those who took part in it were not exempted from
                            extradition by the treaty of December 11, 1896. As his predecessor, the
                            Hon. Walter Q. Gresham, had decided this point in his note of May 13,
                            1893, in the sense that that attack was not of a merely political
                            character, Mr. Olney did not need to examine the same question, and
                            would have needed to do so only in case he had thought it necessary to
                            revoke the decision of his predecessor, and for that reason he did not
                            enter into special considerations with respect to the attack, but
                            confined himself to issuing a warrant for the surrender of the accused
                            persons, whereby he undoubtedly admitted that the crime with which they
                            were charged was not of a purely political character.</p>
                        <p>I understand that the Department of State observes the wise system of
                            maintaining the decisions reached by the Secretaries who have been at
                            its head, and of not revoking them unless new incidents arise or fresh
                            evidence is obtained of a nature so clear and conclusive that, if they
                            had been considered by the Secretary who reached the decision concerned,
                            they would have led him to form a decision at variance with that which
                            he did form. In view of this circumstance the Government <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0449"/>of Mexico hoped that the decision
                            reached by Mr. Gresham and upheld by Mr. Olney would be considered valid
                            in the case of Jesus Guerra, since no evidence or incidents have arisen
                            of such a nature as to change the character of the attack on San
                            Ignacio, which has been considered by your predecessors as not having
                            been a purely political offense.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States
                            pronounced March 14, 1896, in the habeas corpus case of Ines Ruiz, Jesus
                            Guerra, and Juan Duque, I must say that I clearly understand that the
                            point which was submitted to it on appeal was to decide concerning the
                            validity or invalidity of the decision which granted a writ of habeas
                            corpus to the accused persons, and which revoked the decision granting
                            their surrender which had been pronounced by the United States
                            commissioner at San Antonio, and that it was not to determine whether
                            the crime with which they were charged was or was not of a purely
                            political character; nevertheless, the statement contained in the
                            extract from that decision, which 1 inserted in my note of November 15
                            last, in which it is positively stated that the attack on San Ignacio
                            was not of a purely political character, is, in my opinion, not without
                            force, and is entitled to high respect. I frequently see quoted, in
                            decisions pronounced by the courts of this country, declarations made in
                            the “whereases” and not in the resolutory part of the decisions of the
                            Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
                        <p>It is a generally recognized principle that those who are guilty of
                            political crimes are not subject to extradition, and the citations
                            contained in your note on this point refer to really political crimes,
                            even though in case of crimes of this nature common crimes are
                            incidentally committed, but when, in order to conceal common crimes,
                            political pretexts are invoked, the case is different, and for the very
                            purpose of authorizing the extradition of persons charged with these
                            latter crimes the provision was inserted in the extradition treaty
                            signed in the City of Mexico December 11, 1861, between Mexico and the
                            United States, that persons guilty of purely political crimes were not
                            subject to extradition, which, in the opinion of the Government of
                            Mexico, means that when a crime is of a common character, and, in order
                            to conceal it, the attempt is made to make it appear to be a political
                            crime, as in the present case, it is considered as a crime which renders
                            its perpetrator subject to extradition. The treaty signed between the
                            United States and France November 9, 1843, is the only one containing a
                            clause similar to that of the treaty with Mexico, and the one signed
                            with Belgium April 30, 1874, authorizes the extradition of persons
                            guilty of certain common crimes connected with others of a political
                            character. The circumstance that Mexico and the United States are
                            neighbors renders special stipulations necessary with regard to
                            extradition still more ample than those contained in the treaty with
                            Belgium.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your excellency’s note of the 18th ultimo touching the
                            extradition of Jesus Guerra, and again invoking the doctrine of stare
                            decisis in support of your excellency’s contention. I concur entirely in
                            your excellency’s opinion of <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0450"/>the wisdom of a uniform rule of decision in all cases when the facts
                            are of the same essential legal character. And from this standpoint the
                            refusal to extradite Guerra finds sufficient vindication, since the
                            refusal was in keeping with the uniform rule of decision in all such
                            cases except in the single case, on which your excellency relied for the
                            reversal of all other previous decisions.</p>
                        <p>I observe with pleasure—and it does great credit to your excellency’s
                            character for candor and sincerity—the abandonment, in your excellency’s
                            note, of the former contention that the Supreme Court decided that “the
                            assault at San Ignacio was not an offense of a purely political
                            character,” and the admission that the question for its decision “was
                            not to determine whether the crime with which they were charged was or
                            was not of a purely political character.” But the contention now made is
                            that an isolated dictum of the Supreme Court is “not without force and
                            is entitled to high respect.” In this opinion I fully concur, and as the
                            court studiously refrained from deciding a question over which it
                            virtually held that it had no jurisdiction, I should have felt wanting
                            in respect to its great character had I imputed to it any intention to
                            decide indirectly and with great impropriety what it could not do
                            directly, and therefore abstained from doing.</p>
                        <p>I concur entirely in your excellency’s view that “when political pretexts
                            are invoked to conceal common crimes,” such pretexts, or any others, can
                            not be allowed to shield the guilty. But in the Guerra case there is
                            such evidence to show the revolutionary character of the expedition, and
                            no evidence to contradict it.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of any reference to historical evidence in support of it,
                            I can neither assent to nor dissent from your excellency’s opinion of
                            the object of the insertion of the word “purely” in the extradition
                            treaty. The word is sometimes used interchangeably with the word
                            “absolutely,” and if it is used in this sense, then, as shown in my last
                            note, nonextradition for absolute political offenses is always implied
                            in treaties without making any express exception; when they exclude
                            political offenses, it is precisely connected or complex offenses which
                            are meant.</p>
                        <p>It being unnecessary in this case to construe the treaty, no opinion is
                            expressed as to the construction placed on it by your excellency. But it
                            may be doubted whether it was the intendment of the treaty to include
                            connected or complex offenses in the category of extraditable offenses.
                            For, on the one hand, the exclusion of absolutely or purely political
                            offenses is implied without express exception, while the express
                            exception of political offenses excludes mixed or connected offenses;
                            and, on the other hand, if so wide a departure from the traditional
                            policy of this Government had been intended, it is reasonable to suppose
                            that the inclusion of such offenses would have been clearly and
                            specifically indicated, as was done in the treaty with Belgium. And if
                            the intent in the insertion of the word had been such as your excellency
                            supposes, it is remarkable that no allusion appears to have been made to
                            it heretofore either in the Cazo case or in the case of the eight
                            Mexican revolutionists, when extradition was refused for the same
                            reasons as in this case.</p>
                        <p>Over thirty years have elapsed since the adoption of the treaty, and so
                            far as I am informed the construction of the treaty now made by your
                            excellency is made for the first time, and if it had been made and
                            accepted in the two cases above mentioned, extradition should have been
                            granted instead of being refused.</p>
                        <p>Accept, etc.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the night of April 3 I received your
                            cable instruction regarding the apprehension of the Maritime Canal
                            Company that the Nicaraguan Government may declare the forfeiture of
                            their concession.</p>
                        <p>On the morning of the 6th I had an informal and unofficial talk with
                            President Zelaya on the general subject suggested, without making known
                            to him the instruction contained in your cable message.</p>
                        <p>We hastily reviewed the arguments pro and con as to the claim that the
                            concession would end by limitation on the 24th of the current month. In
                            the course of this conversation the President assured me more than once
                            of his intention to act in absolute good faith toward the Maritime Canal
                            Company and toward the United States, under whose authority the company
                            is chartered.</p>
                        <p>At the close of the conversation the President requested me to submit to
                            him a memorandum of the statements I had verbally made to him. This I
                            did on the following day, marking the paper “unofficial memoranda.”</p>
                        <p>I inclose herewith a copy of these notes.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor, etc.,</p>

                            <p rend="center">Unofficial memoranda regarding the date of expiration
                                of the concession to the Maritime Canal Company.</p>
                            <p>From a cable message which I have received from Mr. Sherman, our
                                Secretary of State, I am surprised to learn that apprehensions exist
                                that the Nicaraguan Government may declare the concession of the
                                Maritime Canal Company as having been forfeited for some cause not
                                stated.</p>
                            <p>I prefer to believe, Mr. President, that the apprehension referred to
                                is not well founded, that Nicaragua will continue to act in the
                                future as she has acted in the past while under your guidance, in
                                absolute good faith toward this company, notwithstanding the fond
                                wishes of the people of Nicaragua, of the people of the United
                                States, and of the commercial nations of the earth have not been
                                realized, because of the financial crisis which swept over the
                                civilized world during the last few years.</p>
                            <p>You have always consistently and frankly assured me that your
                                Government would do nothing to embarrass the efforts being made to
                                raise the means to complete this enterprise, which, in the words of
                                Mr. Sherman in a recent speech delivered on the floor of the United
                                States Senate, “will be the greatest achievement for the good of
                                mankind that is likely to happen in the course of a hundred
                                years.”</p>
                            <p>Secretary Sherman is no stranger to you. Mr. President. As member of
                                the United States Senate, as chairman of the leading committee of
                                that body, and in his capacity as a citizen, he has at all times
                                been a loyal, able, and persistent advocate of the building of this
                                canal by Government aid. You know he stands with you and by your
                                interests. Therefore you can afford to treat what he says with
                                respect and confidence. He states in a cable which I hold in my hand
                                that the concession of the Maritime Canal Company does not expire
                                until October, 1899.</p>
                            <p>Let us suppose that the Nicaraguan Government proceeds to declare the
                                concession forfeited. The other party in interest must, in
                                self-defense, join issue with you. Who is to decide? Will you
                                wrangle until October, 1899, or will you propose arbitration? In
                                either case, nothing has been done to promote the one great
                                object—the building of this canal. Valuable time has been lost,
                                possibly bad blood created, and expenses incurred—nothing more.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency will remember—and it is doubtless a matter of record
                                in the archives in this palace—that, after some differences which
                                had sprung up between Nicaragua and the Maritime Canal Company had
                                been adjusted in the year 1889, your Government officially approved
                                the surveys of the company and the work already done. By this
                                agreement an official recognition was given that the work of
                                construction actually commenced on the 8th of October, 1889. From
                                that date the contract had ten years to run. This term will not
                                expire until the 8th of October, 1899.</p>
                            <p>This is the view held by Mr. Blaine, who was also your friend, and it
                                is the view held by Secretary Sherman, as evidenced by his cable
                                message.</p>
                            <p>It may be profitable for us to make a brief review of the
                                circumstances attending the commencement of the work, and therefore
                                the beginning of the concession.</p>
                            <p>“The provisions of Article XLVII of the concession, relating to the
                                final surveys and the location of the line of the canal by a
                                commission of competent engineers, two of whom were to be appointed
                                by the Government of Nicaragua, have been fully complied with, and
                                the Government of Nicaragua has officially issued its decrees to
                                that effect. The company undertook at its own expense the final
                                surveys of the ground and the location of the line of the canal by a
                                commission of competent engineers, two of whom, Messrs. Blanchet and
                                Climie, were appointed by the Government of the Republic, as
                                required by the concession.</p>
                            <p>“This commission completed the final surveys and the location of the
                                canal, and their plans were afterwards signed, indorsed, and
                                approved in New York by Mr. Blanchet, who went on for the purpose of
                                assisting the engineers in tabulating and formulating the data which
                                they had obtained during the months which were spent on the ground.
                                The plans were then forwarded to the Government of Nicaragua, which
                                raised certain objections in reference to the same, claiming that
                                the surveys relating to the Tipitapa Canal were not as complete as
                                were required. The plans were elaborated so as to conform with these
                                objections, and were then returned to the Government, but Nicaragua
                                having taken exception to the concession which had been obtained by
                                the company from Costa Rica, refused at first to ratify and approve
                                the same, on the ground that they did not show that the entire line
                                of the canal would run through Nicaraguan territory only.</p>
                            <p>“On the strength of this objection, they refused to allow the
                                expedition which had been sent down in June, 1889, to commence work
                                on the canal, and this state of affairs existed until October 8,
                                1889, on which date the Government issued a decree approving and

                                the commencement of the work of construction.</p>
                            <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0453"/>
                            <p>“The same article of the concession granted to the company a term not
                                exceeding one year in which to commence the final surveys for the
                                canal, and one year and a half additional time for completing them.
                                These terms were to begin to be counted on the date of the
                                ratification of the contract, which took place on April 24, 1887, so
                                that the period within which to commence the final surveys expired
                                on April 24, 1888, and the time within which to complete them
                                expired on October 24, 1889.</p>
                            <p>“As already stated, on October 8, 1889, the Government decreed that
                                the plans had been commenced and completed within the said periods,
                                and the same were accepted.</p>
                            <p>“So it will be seen that the company has fully complied in every
                                respect with the provisions of the concession in reference to these
                                plans.</p>
                            <p>“Article XLVII of the concession also provides that within the period
                                commencing April 24, 1888, and expiring October 24, 1889, the
                                Maritime Canal Company of Nicaragua was to be organized and the work
                                of construction commenced. The canal company was incorporated by act
                                of the United States Congress in February, 1889, and its board of
                                directors organized on the 1st day of May, 1889, and, as already
                                stated, the Government admitted in its decree that the work of
                                construction was commenced on the 8th day of October, 1889. The
                                concession required that during the first year of the work, viz,
                                from October 8, 1889, to October 8, 1890 (the said work having been
                                commenced, as admitted by said decree, on the 8th day of October,
                                1889), at least $2,000,000 should be expended, and on the ___ day of
                                ___, 1890, the Government having appointed two commissioners to
                                ascertain what moneys had been expended on the work, issued another
                                decree to the effect that this provision of the concession had been
                                fully complied with.</p>
                            <p>“It appears, therefore, that the Government has admitted that every
                                provision of said Article XLVII has been complied with by the
                                company and that the corporation has no further obligations to
                                perform under this article of the concession.</p>
                            <p>“Article XLVIII of the concession grants to the corporation a term of
                                ten years for the construction, completion, and opening of the canal
                                for maritime navigation. That is to say, the concession grants to
                                the company a period of two years and a half within which to
                                commence and complete the final surveys, to organize the Maritime
                                Canal Company of Nicaragua, and to commence the work of
                                construction, and grants them an additional term of ten years in
                                which to construct, complete, and open the canal. As already stated,
                                the first term of two years and a half would have expired on the
                                24th of October, 1889, so that the additional term of ten years
                                granted will not expire until the 24th of October, 1899. If,
                                however, it should be claimed that the said term of ten years for
                                the construction of the canal was to commence from the date on which
                                the work of construction was begun, irrespective of whether or not
                                the aforesaid term of two years and a half had expired, then the
                                said term of ten years will expire on the 8th day of October, 1899,
                                instead of on the 24th day of October, 1899.”</p>
                            <p>This unofficial memoranda is respectfully submitted, as you
                                suggested, for your excellency’s personal convenience.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, I will express my gratification at the whole tone of
                                friendliness toward the prosecution of the canal enterprise under
                                American auspices which characterized your conversation with me
                                yesterday, and especially for the personal assurance yon were
                                pleased to give me that the franchise of the Maritime Canal Company
                                would not be interfered with by the Nicaraguan Government until it
                                lapses by its own limitation in October, 1899, unless, to use your
                                own words, “the Government of the United States may desire to make a
                                contract direct with this Government to build the canal itself.”</p>

                            the company having this work in charge. It is now settled that the line

                                States to determine the points of disagreement between the
                                commissions of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, charged with the tracing of
                                the division line, the award relating to the starting point on the
                                Atlantic, I must indicate to your excellency that my Government has
                                accepted with pleasure the said award, because it was inspired by
                                justice, based upon impartial and honest judgment, and the
                                Nicaraguan people have received it with equal pleasure.</p>
                            <p>It is my duty to indicate again the gratitude of the Government of
                                Nicaragua for the wise appointment of the engineer arbitrator made
                                by the President of the United States in the person of the honorable
                                Mr. Alexander, whose illustrious and honored procedure has
                                contributed to give a pacific solution to the boundary dispute
                                between Nicaragua and Costa Rica.</p>
                            <p>Taking this opportunity to repeat to your excellency, etc.,</p>

                            contract, and a translation of the same, made by the Government of
                            Nicaragua with the Atlas Steamship Company, limited, a British
                            corporation, for the exclusive navigation of the San Juan River and Lake
                            Nicaragua. This exclusive right <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0456"/>is in contravention of a provision of the constitution of this
                            Republic, which prohibits the giving of exclusive privileges for the
                            navigation of any of the waters of the State. One of the most prominent
                            features that will probably challenge your attention is the interference
                            that this is bound to create with any treaty that may hereafter be
                            proposed for the building of the canal. While this contract assumes to
                            protect the present concession of the Maritime Canal Company, it makes
                            no provision for a future treaty with the United States. This is
                            submitted for the consideration of the honorable Secretary, and I await
                            any observations upon the subject you may desire to make.</p>

                                arranged the following contract with the idea of developing the

                                which each day becomes less navigable, and to facilitate the

                                with the expectation of developing the commerce and agriculture and
                                thus improving the situation in the country.</p>

                                <item>The Government, in consideration of the great expenses to
                                    which the Atlas Steamship Company, Ld., will be subject, gives
                                    it the exclusive right of steam navigation in the Silico lagoon
                                    for 30 years from the final approval of this contract, and the
                                    exclusive right for the same time of constructing tramways and
                                    railroads along the line, and at the best places to avoid the
                                    obstacles in the River San Juan.</item>

                                <item>The company is obliged to construct on its own account a
                                    narrow-guage railroad which will place in communication a point
                                    at the Colorado Junction and another convenient point on the
                                    Silico lagoon, avoiding the navigation of the dry and most
                                    difficult part of the River San Juan, thus making more rapid the
                                    transit during the summer to the port of San Juan del Norte. The
                                    length of this line will be, more or less, five miles, and at
                                    the terminals of the line the company shall build houses and
                                    wharfs, which are necessary for passenger and merchandise
                                    traffic and other services.</item>

                                <item>The Government will give the company $5,000, silver, for each
                                    mile of railroad constructed, in successive monthly payments of
                                    $1,000, from the time the governor of San Juan del Norte has
                                    been advised that the work of railroad construction has been
                                    begun. In case the work is interrupted the payments will be
                                    suspended until the work is continued.</item>

                                    laws which govern such action. The company will have the right

                                    the line crosses and a strip of land 100 varas wide for the
                                    entire length of the line between the expressed
                                    terminals.</item>

                                <item>The Government, in the same manner, gives the company the
                                    right to cut in the national woods adjacent to Lake Nicaragua
                                    and the River San Juan, without payment all the wood which is
                                    required for the use of steamers, tramways, railroads, wharves,
                                    houses, shops, etc., etc.</item>

                                <item>The Government concedes to the company the right to occupy, in

                                    are necessary for the establishment of warehouses, tramways,
                                    offices, shops, stations, etc., etc. It is understood that the
                                    lots will be selected satisfactory to the Government, and in
                                    case any of them belong to private parties the Government will
                                    authorize appropriation of the same. The company will pay all
                                    damages if the prices can not be agreed upon with the respective
                                    owners.</item>

                            the San Juan River and Lake Nicaragua, I have to report that the
                            Congress of Nicaragua approved on September 29 the concession with two
                            additions, viz, articles 21 and 22. I inclose a copy of the same with a
                            translation. The idea conveyed in article 21 is that for all money
                            expended by the Atlas Company in making improvements in the San Juan
                            River it shall be reimbursed by the canal company. The Government of

                            China to appoint consular representatives, that you and our consular

                        <p>Your efforts are to be confined to the friendly intervention in case of

                            unjust and harsh treatment. You are not to hold any representative

                            informally. Before taking any steps in the matter, however, you should
                            represent to the Governments of Nicaragua and Salvador, respectively,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the Department No. 470, of
                            July 3 last, respecting the exercise of the good offices of our
                            diplomatic and consular officers to Chinese subjects residing in
                            Nicaragua and Salvador, and to your No. 693, of September 4 last,
                            reporting that Salvador will allow the representatives of the United
                            States to exercise their good offices unofficially in behalf of Chinese
                            subjects, I inclose herewith copy of a note from the Chinese minister at
                            this capital, stating that a delegation of Chinese who called upon the
                            consul at San Salvador was informed by him that he deemed it necessary
                            to receive explicit instructions from this Government before he would
                            feel authorized to exercise his good offices.</p>
                        <p>The terms upon which protection is granted, at the request of the Chinese
                            Government and with the acquiescence of that of Salvador, are stated in
                            the correspondence had with your legation, and the Government of
                            Salvador has been informed of the scope of such protection, good offices
                            being extended in behalf of Chinese persons by you and the consular
                            officers without assumption of any representative function as agents of
                            China. It of course follows that our officers so acting can not
                            originally certify to the fact of Chinese citizenship for a passport or
                            other documentary attestation to that end, which could only be issued by
                            a responsible agent of the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>This being so, a form of certificate to be used by you and the consul at
                            San Salvador should be prepared in consultation with the Salvadorean
                            minister for foreign affairs, in order that it may correctly express the
                            character of the protection afforded and the degree to which it is
                            recognized by Salvador. Something like this would probably suffice:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>I, ____ _____, of the United States of America, <hi rend="italic">certify:</hi> That _____ _____ claims to be a subject of

                                    between the Governments of Salvador and China to that end.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Similar action should be taken as regards Nicaragua, who, your No. 687,

                            good offices.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my dispatch No. 278,
                            concerning certain restrictions placed on the introduction of books into
                            Persia, I have the honor to forward further correspondence on the
                            subject. After receiving the response of the foreign minister to my
                            protest, herewith inclosed, I called on his excellency by appointment,
                            and had an interview with him in further elucidation of the matter. I
                            stated to him that my countrymen were complaining of the hindrance and
                            hardship that the order, if executed, would work on their educational
                            and religious operations, and that they were urging me to endeavor to
                            have it rescinded. His excellency responded that so far as books for
                            educational, scientific, and literary purposes were concerned there was
                            no desire or purpose to restrict them, and that the necessary permits
                            would be freely issued; but as to books of a religious character, if
                            designed for distribution among Mohammedans, it would be different; that
                            trouble had been caused in the south of Persia by the distribution by
                            English missionaries of such books, and even money among the
                            Mohammedans, which had greatly excited the mohlus or priests, who are so
                            powerful with the people, and that serious trouble was feared, for which
                            the Government could not be responsible. Therefore it had taken this
                            step to preserve the peace and quiet of the country, and not simply to
                            enforce vexatious conditions on the missionaries. As far as the
                            circulation of religious books among the anti-Mohammedans, Jews, etc.,
                            was concerned, there was no purpose or desire to interfere with
                            that.</p>
                        <p>This is the status of the question at the present moment, and if the
                            Department has any instructions to give concerning it I would be pleased
                            to receive them.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that yesterday
                            I interposed unofficially in behalf of the Jews of this city, who, by
                            concerted action, were subjected to riot and mob violence by the
                            Mohammedans. In the morning I received a message from Rev. Mr. Ward, one
                            of the American missionaries, saying that a massacre, or at least a
                            persecution, was going on in the Jewish quarter, and asking me to do all
                            I could, to stop it. I immediately drove to the palace and had an
                            interview with the Amin-ed-Dovlet, the chief of the Shah’s ministers. I
                            told him what I had heard, and, without any authority in the matter, I
                            had come in the interest of humanity to ask that immediate steps be
                            taken for the protection <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0464"/>of the
                            assaulted people—that they were a race without a country or government
                            of their own to defend them; that they were, as a rule, harmless and
                            inoffensive, and I in the emergency felt like speaking strongly for them
                            in behalf of myself and my country, where so many of them are domiciled.
                            His excellency replied that he was informed there had been some serious
                            trouble; some Jews had been beaten and roughly treated; that they had
                            been required to have their hair cut in a certain way, and to put on a
                            red badge to designate their race: but he was informed by the governor
                            of the city that the maltreatment had ceased and order had been
                            restored. He said that he himself was a friend of the Jews and would
                            endeavor to see that they were not mistreated. I then thanked him and
                            retired. On reaching the palace grounds I was surrounded by a number of
                            Jewish women who had come for redress, and who were loud in their
                            complaints and grateful in their expressions for what I was trying to do
                            for them. Later in the day Mr. Tyler, interpreter and vice-consul
                            general, drove to the Jewish quarter and said he found all quiet. I
                            understand that the English legation also took some steps in the
                            matter.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: In the conversation which
                                I had with you yesterday morning I was given to understand that the

                                Jews had ceased. I regret to state to you, however, that I have just
                                been informed that there has been a renewal of the maltreatment, and
                                that many have been subjected to ill usage and indignities, while
                                the government ferashes (police) sent, I presume, to restore order
                                have forcibly taken money, and left without effecting anything for
                                the preservation of the peace of the district. I have not the
                                remotest desire to interfere or to make any suggestions as to the
                                administration of the affairs of this city, but from motives of
                                humanity and of sympathy with those who are called upon to suffer, I

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Most Illustrious and Most Excellent Sir</hi>: As I
                            told you in the course of the conversation which I had the honor to have
                            with your excellency on the 7th instant, I instructed Mr. Laidley, in
                            charge of His Majesty’s consulate at San Francisco, to investigate the
                            insult to the Portuguese flag at Monterey, Cal. Mr. Laidley, after
                            having been to Monterey, where he has made a personal investigation of
                            the case, reports to me as follows:</p>
                        <p>Manuel Ortins, a man of Portuguese origin, who is naturalized as an
                            American citizen, desiring to celebrate the 4th of July, hoisted over
                            his house the American flag, which is his own, and, together with it on
                            another corner of the roof, the flag of his forefathers, viz, the
                            Portuguese flag. I mention these facts inasmuch as they show with what
                            care the investigation was made, and the fact that the situations of the
                            two national emblems were altogether similar so that they were not
                            calculated to irritate the most delicate susceptibility. The flagstaff’s
                            on which the flags were raised, adds Mr. Laidley, were of the same
                            height and about 26 feet apart.</p>
                        <p>At about noon on the aforesaid 4th of July someone told Ortins that the
                            Portuguese flag was not on the flagstaff, and that a certain Mr. Seely
                            had paid a boy 16 years of age, named Thomas Harvey, to haul it
                            down.</p>
                        <p>Ortins, having ascertained that such was the fact, again hoisted the
                            Portuguese flag in the same place. The flag was subsequently again taken
                            down by another youth, named Harry Pennington, who gave it to a man
                            called Happy Harry, who disappeared with it. In the evening the flag was
                            burned at a place called Whale Point, but the acting consul at San
                            Francisco was unable to find out by whom.</p>
                        <p>Two pieces of the flag were found on the morning of the 5th (6th?) by
                            Manuel José da Silva, a subject of His Majesty, and were delivered by
                            him to Mr. Ernest Michaelis, a justice of the peace.</p>
                        <p>Ortins complained to the local authorities, who instituted proceedings
                            against M. P. Seely for “disturbing the peace.” As Seely stated that he
                            had important business in San Francisco he was admitted to bail in the
                            sum of $20 and the trial was adjourned sine die.</p>
                        <p>The insult to the flag of a friendly country is evident and is aggravated
                            by the fact that it occurred in a State in which there is a numerous
                            Portuguese colony, and in which, consequently, it might have given rise
                            to conflicts which would certainly have been equally lamented by His
                            Majesty’s Government and by that of the United States of America.</p>
                        <p>I am firmly convinced that the American courts to which the judicial
                            question is intrusted will decide it in accordance with light and law,
                            not losing sight of the gravity of the case.</p>
                        <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0467"/>
                        <p>As to the purely international question, I know the respect which the
                            American Government has for the rights and the dignity of others, and
                            the words that your excellency did me the honor to address to me on this
                            subject have still further confirmed me in my previous conviction.</p>
                        <p>I therefore confine myself to a simple statement of the facts, leaving it
                            to your excellency, with your spirit of enlightenment, and to the
                            sentiments of justice and courtesy of the American Government, to form a
                            proper estimate of said facts.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your note of the 21st
                            instant, and your oral communications since then, concerning an alleged
                            insult to the Portuguese flag at Monterey, Gal., I have the honor to
                            inform you that I have received, under direction of the governor of
                            California, a copy of the report submitted by the district attorney of
                            Monterey County, with a complete copy of the testimony taken in the
                            investigation, which was promptly ordered upon your request.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Zabala, the district attorney, reports that it was with difficulty
                            that he secured the testimony in the case, being unable to obtain much
                            assistance at the hands of reluctant witnesses, whose unwillingness to
                            testify he attributes, not to any desire on the part of the citizens of
                            Monterey to suppress the facts in the case, but to the natural aversion
                            of the people to become witnesses at any time.</p>
                        <p>The testimony indicates that the Portuguese flag was flying, as described
                            by you, side by side with the American flag, on poles of equal height,
                            but separated by the width of Mr. Ortins’s shop, about 18 or 20 feet. It
                            appears to have been taken down twice, the first time soon after noon,
                            by some unknown person, after which it was raised again by Mr. Ortins;
                            and the second time between 5 and 6 o’clock in the afternoon, when the
                            halyards were cut by a small boy at the instance of one Harry Morton,
                            after which it disappeared, and, although charred fragments were found
                            at some distance from the spot, the person who burned the flag could not
                            be identified.</p>
                        <p>A certain Captain Seeley, a drillmaster of the Monterey Cadets, is
                            identified by several witnesses as having instigated the lowering of the
                            flag in question.</p>
                        <p>The district attorney adds in his report that— <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The acts of both Seeley and Morton must not be attributed to the
                                    citizens, and the latter surely disavow all blame for the deeds
                                    of Captain Seeley, an adventurous drill-master of unknown and
                                    unbegrudged antecedents, and of Harry Morton, an extremist in
                                    the imbibing from the flowing bowl.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I transcribe for your information the report of the district attorney and
                            the testimony which accompanied the same, feeling assured that you will
                            find therein abundant proof that the lawless act of which you have
                            complained in no wise represented the feelings of the law-abiding
                            portion of the community. That no insult to the Portuguese Government
                            could be intended is obvious when it is considered that Mr. Ortins, who
                            displayed the flag, was himself a naturalized citizen of the United <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0468"/>States, and as such had no
                            right to fly the flag of the country of his origin for the distinctive
                            purpose of protection or in assertion of any right claimable by him as a
                            Portuguese subject. So far as his individual rights are concerned, he
                            had a remedy at law against the guilty parties, but declined to lodge a
                            complaint.</p>
                        <p>These circumstances, however, do not exclude sincere regret for the
                            occurrence and disavowal of sympathy therewith on the part of the
                            reputable citizens of Monterey, which I have now the pleasure to express
                            to you.</p>
                        <p>Accept, etc.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to
                            acknowledge the receipt of the note which Mr. Adee addressed to me on
                            the 28th ultimo, during your excellency’s absence, with regard to the
                            Monterey affair, and I am much obliged for the explanations which it
                            contained, and which I hastened to transmit to His Majesty’s
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Permit me, your excellency, to avail myself of this opportunity to
                            correct a slight mistake which appears to have been made in the State
                            Department as to my intervention in this matter.</p>
                        <p>I only heard of the occurrence through the accounts in the newspapers,
                            and subsequently through the report which was sent to me by my order by
                            the person in charge of the consulate at San Francisco.</p>
                        <p>I have received no complaint from Manuel Ortins, nor, as he is now an
                            American citizen, would I in any case presume to interfere in his
                            behalf. Still, the Portuguese flag can never be regarded as a mere
                            ornament; it is always a national emblem. When a friendly Government
                            permits it to be raised in its territory by its own citizens, it
                            naturally guarantees it the respect to which it is entitled. It was only
                            upon these principles that I called your excellency’s attention to the
                            matter, and I am confident that the explanations which have been
                            interchanged in so candid and friendly a manner between His Majesty’s
                            legation and the American Government will tend to strengthen the
                            feelings of reciprocal esteem and mutual respect which have so long
                            uninterruptedly united the two Governments.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your No. 354 of January 4, inclosing copy of a letter from
                            the governor of Montana in regard to the case of John Ginzberg.</p>
                        <p>Ginzberg has been, at my request, sent from Loguishin, in the province of
                            Minsk, to Libau, from which port Mr. Neils P. Bornholdt, United States
                            consul at Riga, who has a large shipping business, has promised for him
                            opportunity to work his passage to Antwerp. I have requested Mr.
                            Bornholdt to instruct his agents to hand over to Ginzberg 95 rubles, the
                            amount of draft which has been received for him. As this is to Mr.
                            Breckinridge’s order, I have told Mr. Bornholdt that I would personally
                            be responsible for the payment to him of the amount, but that I awaited
                            the return of the minister before remitting. Ginzberg’s departure for
                            the United States may be expected in the course of the next ten
                            days.</p>
                        <p>I may add with regard to this case that on the occasion of my last visit
                            to the foreign office regarding him the officer immediately in charge of
                            the documents in his case remarked with exclamation that according to
                            usual practice he had been very leniently dealt with.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to Department’s No. 372, of
                            February 13, I have the honor to say that advices from our consul at
                            Riga, Mr. Bornholdt, inform me that Mr. John Ginzberg has sailed from
                            Libau for London by the steamer <hi rend="italic">Kiew.</hi></p>
                        <p>It gives me pleasure to state in regard to this protracted and
                            interesting case that during my absence upon leave it has been followed
                            up with zeal and discretion by Mr. Peirce, the Chargé d’affaires ad
                            interim, and that his efforts received the cordial and efficient
                            cooperation of Mr. Bornholdt, our consul at Riga. Mr. Ginzberg, by the
                            course followed, <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0470"/>has been
                            slowly, but as rapidly as possible, relieved from the embarrassments
                            that were found to exist even after his acquittal; and it is a great
                            relief to be able to report that he is at last out of the Empire and
                            safely on his way home.</p>
                        <p>Remittance of 95 rubles has been made to Mr. Bornholdt to cover money
                            advanced by him to Mr. Ginzberg.</p>
                        <p>I may remark that an apparent result of the continuous and earnest
                            efforts of the past two or more years is some amelioration of the
                            unbending severity that previously marked the policy of the Russian
                            Government in cases of this kind. Until, however, the still ineffectual
                            efforts to effect a conventional arrangement with Russia, upon the
                            subject of expatriation, are more successful, our citizens of Russian
                            origin, unless with previous Russian consent, expose themselves to the
                            gravest hardship by returning to the Empire.</p>

                            Nathan, an American Hebrew, to visit Russia, had been granted by the

                        <p>In this connection I inclose copy of a letter from Mr. Charles L. Aarons,
                            of Milwaukee, transmitting copy of a reply made by the Russian legation
                            at this capital to a request for permission made, in behalf of a
                            naturalized American citizen of Russian birth, to visit Russia.</p>
                        <p>This reply was couched in terms new to this Departments.</p>
                        <p>It may be prudent to inquire if the condition of five years’ service in
                            the Russian army is in lieu of the criminal liability incurred under
                            article 325 of the Penal Code for the offense of becoming a naturalized
                            citizen in a foreign country and whether the same condition of return
                            extends to Jews. If penal exile to Siberia or arrest and expulsion as a
                            Jew should lie, the reply of the Russian legation would seem to be
                            unnecessarily silent as to these possible aspects of the case.</p>

                            <p>He is desirous of making a visit to Russo-Poland, his birthplace, to
                                visit his aged parents, whom he left about twenty years ago, and
                                makes this request for a passport or such other authority as will
                                show his citizenship and right to travel. He is in possession of his
                                first and second citizenship papers, and will forward them to you if
                                necessary.</p>

                                Washington, stating that Mr. Marks left his native land at the age
                                of 17 and for no other purpose than to earn a living for himself and
                                for his parents. He has been doing this in this country ever since;
                                consequently he was not in Russia at the time when his enlistment
                                would have taken place at the age of 21 years.</p>
                            <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0472"/>
                            <p>I wrote asking the Russian ambassador that a special permit from him
                                be given to Mr. Marks assuring him that he would not be disturbed
                                and allowing him to visit his birthplace. I herewith inclose copy of
                                answer received by me.</p>

                                necessary to announce you this matter. If Mr. Harry Marks is willing

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the Department’s No. 244 of
                            May 16, 1896, I have the honor to transmit herewith copy and translation
                            of the note of Count Lamsdorff of March 4 / February 20, and its
                            inclosure, replying to my inquiry in regard to the Russian law
                            concerning expatriation.</p>
                        <p>Although the present reply does not fully state how far in response to
                            inquiry No. 5 the claims of the Empire continue upon the descendants of
                            a Russian subject born abroad, yet I have been heretofore verbally
                            informed by the legal adviser of the ministry of foreign affairs, and
                            again was so informed on yesterday, that they continue without limit as
                            to generations of descent and regardless of where they are born.</p>
                        <p>While seeking to procure amelioration of the condition of American
                            citizens of Russian nativity, I have not failed to point out to the
                            Russian Government how, if possible, even more acutely repugnant to the
                            American sense would be the application of such a doctrine to those born
                            upon our soil.</p>
                        <p>I believe it is appreciated by the ministry of foreign affairs that, in
                            view of the constant troubles arising from the return of former Russian
                                <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0474"/>subjects to the Empire and
                            the generation or more that has marked the residence of some of that
                            class in our country, the occurrence of such cases is a matter of almost
                            daily chance.</p>
                        <p>It is further seen that as our Government recognizes no distinction
                            between its citizens of native and foreign origin, the fortuitous
                            introduction of the question here involved would be likely to so quicken
                            the sympathies and convictions of all as to reasonably embarrass, for a
                            time, at least, that calm and kindly consideration of the subject which
                            is desired and manifested by both Governments.</p>
                        <p>I may say that a proposed Russian law, now and for some time under
                            consideration, contemplates the repeal of all that part of the present
                            law which extends the prescribed claims and penalties to descendants of
                            claimed Russian subjects born abroad. I think that influential Russian
                            sentiment here feels that Russia owes it to herself to essentially
                            modify these effete laws, and that those charged with the consideration
                            of the matter are seriously desirous of working out a change, guarding
                            the while certain peculiar difficulties which they consider still
                            environs them in the application of the more desirable policy.</p>
                        <p>I have in view some further conferences, the results of which will be
                            duly made known to you.</p>

                                procedure.</p>
                            <p>The examining judge proceeds in an investigation upon the official
                                evidence of the police and local authorities or upon the requisition
                                of the procureur. Persons charged with illegal absence from the

                            <p>Answer. See the reply given above.</p>
                            <p>Question. What, if any, are the penalties provided for those who
                                emigrate in childhood or during their minority and subsequently
                                become citizens or subjects of a foreign country without Imperial
                                consent? And what is the period of minority?</p>
                            <p>Answer. They entail all the consequences mentioned in the first
                                reply, if they do not take the steps necessary when they attain
                                their majority, which is fixed at 21 years of age.</p>
                            <p>Article 221, Vol. X, first part of Civil Code:</p>
                            <p>Article 221. The rights to fully dispose of one’s property, to
                                contract obligations are not acquired before coming of age, that is
                                to say, before 21 years of age.</p>
                            <p>Question. Is military service claimed if it matures while a subject
                                is abroad and after he has sworn allegiance to another country? And
                                what are the penalties for failure to return and perform such
                                service?</p>
                            <p>Answer. By virtue of article 3 of the Regulation of Military Service,
                                persons above 15 years of age can not ask supreme permission to
                                avoid the duties incumbent upon Russian subjects before having
                                acquitted their military obligations. Persons who have attained the
                                age of 20 years and over, who sojourn abroad, are notified to
                                respond to the military service. In case they fail to respond to
                                this call, they entail the penalties indicated in the above
                                mentioned article 326 of the Penal Code.</p>
                            <p>Question 5. What is the status, in the foregoing respect, of the
                                children and further descendants born in the country to which the
                                father may have sworn allegiance or in which he may have acquired
                                citizenship, as herein contemplated?</p>
                            <p>Question 6. Can any of these descendants inherit property or in any
                                way acquire title to property in the Empire?</p>
                            <p>Answer to questions 5 and 6. The children of a Russian subject, born
                                in legitimate marriage, even in the case their father may have lost
                                his civil rights, are considered as Russian subjects and have a
                                right to hold property in the Empire, whether by succession or by
                                any other legal means of acquisition.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            No. 561, of the 24th ultimo, in further relation to the interesting case
                            of Frederick G. Grenz, a naturalized American citizen, who has been
                            acquitted of the charge of having expatriated himself without Imperial
                            permission.</p>
                        <p>This gratifying result, and the remarks of Baron von Osten Sacken, appear
                            to justify your inference that there is a growing disposition among the
                            more advanced statesmen of Russia to regard the old policy and treatment
                            in this class of cases as being “too drastic to meet the requirements of
                            to-day.” It would afford this Government much satisfaction to witness a
                            change in the direction of recognizing the larger policy of most of the
                            modern States by which the right of the citizen or subject to peaceably
                            change his allegiance by orderly process of law is admitted by statute
                            or confirmed by the conclusion of naturalization treaties. The spirit of
                            accommodation which, after many failures through a long series of years,
                            at length enabled the Russian Government to negotiate with the United
                            States a convention of extradition on the most advanced modern lines
                            may, it is hoped, yet permit of an agreement upon the terms of a treaty
                            whereby the irritating questions affecting our naturalized citizens of
                            Russian origin may be removed from the field of discussion and given
                            that practical settlement which may not hopefully be devised so long as
                            the two Governments approach the matter from diametrically opposed
                            standpoints.</p>
                        <p>The Department is disposed to commend the course pursued by you and by
                            Consul Heenan in so dealing with the case of Mr. Grenz as to avoid
                            academic discussion of the abstract merits of the controversy. This
                            Government has no desire to force that of Russia to any abrupt
                            acquiescence in the doctrines we profess as to the liberty of the
                            subject, which tenets we may frankly admit are derived from sources very
                            distinct from the historical traditions of imperialism. It is willing to
                            recognize the good disposition which Russia has shown in her own way and
                            through her own municipal and judicial workings toward personally
                            deserving American citizens who have incurred statutory or technical
                            disabilities in Russia. It would deplore on the part of Russia, as much
                            as it would avoid for its own part, any attempt to narrow the
                            controversy to rigid limits and so bring about a deadlock from which
                            neither party may recede with self-respect. It is prepared now, for many
                            years past, to give to its representatives in Russia the widest latitude
                            to deal with this class of questions according to the more amiable and
                            elastic formulas of unwritten diplomacy, in the confidence that by
                            pursuing this mutually deferential course a more formal agreement upon
                            the essential principles involved may eventually be found within
                            reach.</p>
                        <p>It would be gratifying to discern a similar disposition on the part of
                            the Russian agents in this country. The Russian Government has lately
                            been made acquainted with the indisposition of the United States to
                            acquiesce in any inquisitorial office on the part of Russian agents
                            toward American citizens within the jurisdiction of the United States,
                            whereby a religious test and consequent disability as respects civil
                            rights in Russia may be imposed. The response has been elicited that the
                            test complained of is not essentially religious, but rather racial and
                                <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0477"/>political; and in proof of
                            this, the laws of Russia providing for the favorable treatment of
                            foreign Jews of certain categories seeking to enter Russia have been
                            officially communicated. By the judicial order of March 14, 1891, the
                            power of legations and consulates to vise passports for Russia
                            extends—without previous authorization of the ministry of the
                            interior—to Jewish bankers, chiefs of important commercial houses, and
                            the brokers, representatives, clerks, and agents of such houses.
                            Nevertheless, this Department from time to time learns of the refusal of
                            Russian agents in this country to authenticate the passports of Jews
                            unquestionably belonging to the privileged catagories, no other reason
                            for refusal being assigned them than that the applicants are Jews. The
                            recent case of Mr. Adolf Kutner, a wealthy and highly esteemed merchant
                            of California, to whom a visé was refused by the Chargé d’affaires
                            because he “was not a Christian,” has created a painful impression in
                            the Senate, to members of which high body Mr. Kutner is well and
                            favorably known. A resolution introduced by Senator Perkins, on the 25th
                            ultimo, seeks to emphasize the contrast between the professions of the
                            Russian Government in regard to the favorable treatment of alien Jews
                            resorting to the Empire, and the prohibitory practice of the Russian
                            agents in this country. That resolution, having been referred by the
                            Committee on Foreign Relations to this Department for an expression of
                            its views on the subject, a letter, of which copy is inclosed, was
                            addressed to the chairman of that committee on the 5th instant, in which
                            the position of the Russian Government is truthfully but temperately
                            stated.</p>
                        <p>This matter is not now presented by way of argument and protest, but in
                            order that you may in such friendly and discreet manner as may be
                            practicable suggest to the minister for foreign affairs that one
                            annoying feature of the case may be justly eliminated if the discretion
                            conceded by Russian law to the Imperial legations and consulates in the
                            matter of authenticating the passports of Jews resorting to Russia were
                            made effective and practical as to Jews of the privileged classes; or,
                            in the language of Prince Lobanof’s note of August 12/24, 1895, were in
                            fact operative to admit Jews “of foreign allegiance when they seem to
                            present a guarantee that they will not be a charge and a parasitic
                            element in the State, but will be able, on the contrary, to be useful to
                            the internal development of the country.”</p>
                        <p>This suggestion is made in the same amicable spirit which appears to have
                            prompted the disposal of the Grenz case, and which characterizes your
                            dispatch on the subject and this reply. It can not now be foreseen
                            whether the resolution will be adopted as introduced, but should the
                            Senate approve it, the course of the Department there under would be
                            greatly facilitated were it ascertained in advance that the action of
                            Russian agencies in the United States will be in full harmony with the
                            liberal features of the Russian law.</p>

                                June 27/July 9, in which I had the honor to express assurance of the
                                satisfaction of my Government at the generous recognition by the
                                Imperial Government of the mitigating conditions in the case of Mr.
                                Grenz, a Russian subject who became an American citizen without the
                                consent of the Imperial Government, and his acquittal in accordance
                                therewith, I now have the honor to say that I am in receipt of a
                                dispatch from my Government fully expressing its sentiments in
                                regard to that and kindred matters.</p>
                            <p>My Government charges me to make known to the Imperial Government
                                that while recognizing the extreme doctrinal differences which arise
                                from different historical traditions, it yet appreciates and
                                reciprocates the sentiment of consideration and respect which has
                                been shown. It is pleased to recognize the good disposition shown by
                                the administrative and judicial authorities of the Empire, in
                                accordance with its established laws and practice toward personally
                                deserving persons of conflicting allegiance.</p>
                            <p>It is noted that it was in this spirit of reasonable accommodation
                                and mutual respect which enabled the two Governments, after many
                                failures through a long series of years, to at length agree upon a
                                convention of extradition; and it is believed that the same spirit,
                                so historically maintained, will continue to ameliorate and remove
                                the practical differences which may exist or occasionally arise in
                                the course of the growth and increasing intercourse between the two
                                nations.</p>
                            <p>Concerning the matter of travel and convenience of citizens about
                                whose nationality there is no question, but of the Jewish race which
                                is subject to special regulations within the Empire, the same
                                dispatch desires me to call attention to a practice by the Imperial
                                officials abroad, which is objectionable and seemingly not at all
                                required by the laws of the Empire.</p>
                            <p>In this connection I beg to cite the note to this legation of His
                                Excellency Prince Lobanoff, dated June 26/July 8, 1895, and a note
                                from the same to the same, dated August 12/24, 1895. In these
                                communications, accompanied by an extract of the Russian law upon
                                the subject, his excellency stated that in the case of a Jewish
                                banker, chief of a commercial house, and certain other enumerated
                                classes of business men of known importance of the Hebrew race the
                                Imperial legations and consulates were authorized to issue and vise
                                passports for them to enter Russia according to the same regulations
                                which apply to all foreigners <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0479"/>who seek to enter the Empire, the only condition
                                being that the acting official shall inform his excellency, the
                                minister of the interior, of any passport granted or viséd for an
                                Israelite of the category named.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing provision of the law, it seems that the
                                Imperial officials hesitate to act in the manner indicated. A number
                                of cases of this character have recently been brought to the
                                attention of my Government, and it believes that by simply amending
                                the practice stated, and in accordance with existing law, a great
                                inconvenience to this unobjectionable category of our citizens can
                                be relieved, and the irritating incidents arising therefrom can be
                                obviated.</p>
                            <p>There is no difficulty in the United States of any citizen of the
                                category named (and there can be but little difficulty with such
                                persons applying for a visé abroad) in giving satisfactory
                                commercial or official evidence of his identity and character. So I
                                submit this feature to your excellency with the hope that it may be
                                acceptable.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: Mr. Schmidt,
                                president of the municipal council at Apia, has expressed to the
                                Imperial Government his intention to sail for home on the 23d of
                                January next, at the latest, availing himself of the departure of a
                                vessel which leaves Apia on that day. As Mr. Schmidt accepted the
                                office to which he was appointed for a period of three years only,
                                and as that period will expire on the 31st of the present month of
                                December, there is, in the opinion of the Imperial Government, no
                                objection to Mr. Schmidt’s plan, and his departure can not be
                                prevented. As regards the arrival of Dr. Raffel, Mr. Schmidt’s
                                successor, he will, in all probability, not reach Apia until several
                                months have elapsed. The Imperial Government considers it desirable
                                that the duties of the municipal president should, in the meantime,
                                be performed by the consuls of the treaty powers, just as was done
                                after the retirement of Baron Senfft von Pilsach, the former
                                municipal president, until Mr. Schmidt’s arrival.</p>
                            <p>In having the honor to bring the foregoing to your excellency’s
                                notice, I beg, in pursuance of instructions received, to be
                                informed, as speedily as practicable, whether the United States
                                Government shares the view of the Imperial Government, and is
                                prepared to instruct its representative at Apia accordingly.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge
                                the receipt of your note of the 18th instant, wherein you state that
                                Mr. von Schmidt, president of the municipal council at Apia, who
                                accepted the office for a period of three years, which will expire
                                on the 31st instant, has expressed his intention to leave Samoa by
                                January 23 proximo, on a vessel which sails on that date, and that
                                the Imperial German Government perceives no objection to his
                                departure, which can not be prevented. It is accordingly asked
                                whether this Government shares the same view as that of Germany, and
                                whether it is prepared to instruct the United States consul-general
                                at Apia in that sense, to the end that the consular representatives
                                of the treaty powers at Apia may perform the duties of the municipal
                                president, as was previously done in 1893, until the arrival of Dr.
                                Raffel, which will not occur, according to your note, “until several
                                months have elapsed”—presumably several months after January 23,
                                1896.</p>
                            <p>In view of the unsatisfactory condition of affairs that arose in
                                1893, when the consular body, under instructions from the
                                Governments concerned, relieved Baron Senfft von Pilsach (see Senate
                                Ex. Doc. No. 97, <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0484"/>Fifty-third Congress, third session), it is greatly regretted that
                                so long a period must necessarily elapse between the retirement of
                                Mr. von Schmidt and the arrival of his successor. It is hoped,
                                however, that in case the three Governments are agreed—although I am
                                unable to concur in the statement that Mr. von Schmidt’s “departure
                                can not be prevented”—Dr. Raffel will recognize the urgency of his
                                presence at Apia and the assumption of his official duties at the
                                earliest practicable moment.</p>
                            <p>Regarding the departure of Mr. Schmidt, I may say that in October
                                last he addressed the Department directly requesting to be relieved
                                at the end of December, adding that his successor was expected at
                                the beginning of next year. His motive for sending his request in
                                that manner was, he said, owing to the fact that Mr. Churchill might
                                not in the press of business incident to the departure of the mails
                                find opportunity to communicate the request.</p>
                            <p>October 29 last Mr. von Schmidt’s letter was acknowledged, and on the
                                same day a telegram was addressed to Mr. Churchill directing him to
                                favor the early departure of Mr. von Schmidt.</p>
                            <p>Almost simultaneously with the Department’s action a dispatch was
                                received from Mr. Churchill with an adverse recommendation touching
                                Mr. von Schmidt’s request. I have since received a note from the
                                British ambassador, of the 14th instant, asking the views of this
                                Government in regard to Mr. von Schmidt’s departure. One of its
                                accompaniments is a letter from the British consul, dated Samoa,
                                October 7, 1896, addressed to Lord Salisbury. It speaks of Mr. von
                                Schmidt’s desire to leave before the arrival of his successor, and
                                then adds: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>It would give the consuls a great deal of unnecessary trouble
                                        to have them to take over Mr. Schmidt’s office for a month
                                        and then hand it over again to Dr. Raffel, more especially
                                        as I happen to know that Herr von Schmidt has no urgent
                                        reason for leaving at the end of December.</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>I have advised the British ambassador of the Department’s action on
                                October 29, 1896, and have indicated that, in view of the adverse
                                recommendation of Consul-General Churchill, coupled with statements
                                by Consul Cusack Smith, I would be willing to withdraw my permission
                                for Mr. von Schmidt’s departure before the arrival of Dr. Raffel.
                                Now that it appears that it will be several months from January 23
                                next before Dr. Raffel is expected to reach Apia, I am more strongly
                                convinced that the consuls should not discharge the functions of the
                                municipal president, and if Mr. von Schmidt can not be prevailed
                                upon to await the coming of his successor, that Dr. Raffel’s arrival
                                should at least be expedited, in order not to leave so great an
                                interregnum between the departure of Mr. von Schmidt and the arrival
                                of Dr. Raffel.</p>
                            <p>As the question appears to have become one of divergence between the
                                Imperial Government and that of Her British Majesty, as to which the
                                judgment of the American representative at Samoa coincides with the
                                opinion of his British colleague, I am not prepared to definitely
                                instruct the United States Consul-General in the sense proposed
                                until the adoption of common ground by Germany and Great Britain
                                shall make the deferential concurrence of this Government feasible.
                                Meanwhile Mr. Churchill will be given a copy of this correspondence.
                                I shall likewise inclose a copy to the British ambassador.</p>

                            <p>In view of the foregoing, as well as on account of the condition of
                                Mr. Schmidt’s health, which you now say makes his speedy return home
                                “imperatively necessary,” I have telegraphed Mr. William Churchill,
                                the consul-general of the United States at Apia, to act in harmony
                                with his colleagues in performing the duties of the municipal
                                presidency in the interim between Mr. Schmidt’s departure and Dr.
                                Raffel’s arrival, which, I trust, may be no longer delayed than is
                                actually necessary.</p>

                                instant, No. 37, in regard to two sailors belonging to the German
                                war ship <hi rend="italic">Falke</hi>, who were arrested by the
                                police at Matafele, charged with being drunk and disorderly in the
                                street and with willfully damaging private property. They were
                                subsequently released by direction of the German consul, contrary to
                                any provision of law to that end. It also appears that as early as
                                January last the president of the municipal council at Apia
                                instructed the chief of police that in case any sailors from the
                                German war ships were arrested by the police they were to be
                                released on bail upon a watch being sent ashore for them.</p>

                                <p>The undersigned, ambassador of the United States of America,
                                    acting under instructions from his Government, has the honor to
                                    bring to the attention of His Excellency Baron von Rotenhan,
                                    acting secretary of state for foreign affairs, an incident which
                                    occurred in Samoa in June last, in which, as it has been
                                    officially reported to the Government of the undersigned, it
                                    appears that two sailors from the German warship <hi rend="italic">Falke</hi> were arrested by the police at
                                    Matafele charged with <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0487"/>being drunk and disorderly and with willfully damaging private
                                    property; that the chief of police reported the case to the
                                    local magistrate, Mr. William Cooper, by whom the amount of the
                                    bail was fixed, and the chief of police instructed not to
                                    release the prisoners unless the bail was deposited; that they
                                    were shortly thereafter released by the direction and order of
                                    the German consul, who did not confer with the magistrate, but
                                    stated to the chief of police that he would assume all
                                    responsibility in the premises; that no bail was furnished, and
                                    the prisoners did not appear before the magistrate as ordered by
                                    the court, and that the municipal magistrate strenuously
                                    objected to this assumption of authority by the German consul,
                                    in a communication addressed to the municipal council, insisting
                                    that the order of the court had thereby been treated with
                                    contempt, asserting that neither the municipal court nor its
                                    magistrate were subject to the control or supervision of the
                                    German consul, and pointing out that if the sailors of one
                                    nationality were to be thus withdrawn from the jurisdiction of
                                    the court, the sailors of other nationalities might with equal
                                    right claim similar exemption. It is further reported that in
                                    January, 1896, the president of the municipal council instructed
                                    the chief of police that if any sailors from the German warships
                                    were at any time arrested by the police they were to be released
                                    on a watch being sent ashore for them.</p>
                                <p>In the judgment of the Government of the undersigned it is
                                    beyond, question that the German consul exceeded his authority
                                    in directing the release of the two sailors in question; and as
                                    respects the president of the municipal council, although, as
                                    the chief executive officer, he is in charge of the
                                    administration of the laws and ordinances applicable to the
                                    municipal district of Apia, he is not authorized or empowered to
                                    order the release or discharge of persons who have been legally
                                    placed in custody charged with an offense triable by a municipal
                                    magistrate. It is rather the duty of the president to see that
                                    the laws are faithfully executed. Under no circumstances should
                                    he arbitrarily overrule the municipal regulations, set them at
                                    naught, or assume functions clearly not within his province.
                                    Such acts, besides being illegal, tend unnecessarily to create
                                    ill feeling, discord, strife, and dissatisfaction, whereas the
                                    letter and spirit of the general act are to conciliate all
                                    differences and to restore peace and harmony. The chief aim of
                                    the three Governments concerned, no less than the officers
                                    appointed to execute its provisions, should be to administer the
                                    laws impartially and compose all differences in the interest of
                                    order and good government.</p>
                                <p>Touching this aspect of the case, the municipal magistrate, in
                                    his communication to the municipal council, pertinently
                                    observes: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                you that Her Majesty’s consul in Samoa has suggested that the
                                finances of the island would be greatly eased by the chief justice’s
                                departure and by the consuls, or one of them, being deputed to act
                                in his place until the arrival of his successor.</p>
                            <p>Lord Salisbury has inquired by telegraph when it is expected that Mr.
                                Chambers shall start for his post, and I shall be greatly obliged if
                                you will favor me with this information desired by Lord Salisbury,
                                as well as the views of the United States Government upon the
                                suggestion made by Her Majesty’s consul, which I have above
                                stated.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge
                                the receipt of your note of the 9th instant, suggesting that the
                                finances of the Samoan Government would be materially eased by the
                                departure of the chief justice and by the consuls, or one of them,
                                being deputed to act in his place until the arrival of Mr. Ide’s
                                successor.</p>
                            <p>It is also desired to know when Mr. William Lea Chambers, named as
                                Mr. Ide’s successor, is expected to take his departure.</p>
                            <p>Replying to this last inquiry, I may observe that recently your
                                colleague, the German ambassador, preferred the same request,
                                expressing the hope that it might be as early as possible.</p>
                            <p>On the 9th instant inquiry in this sense was made of Mr. Chambers.
                                His reply is dated the 11th instant, a copy of which I inclose, and
                                which discloses his purpose to sail from San Francisco for his post
                                April 29, 1897, unless an earlier date be suggested by the treaty
                                powers.</p>
                            <p>The Department realizes the necessity of an early departure on the
                                part of Mr. Chambers, which has previously been suggested to him
                                orally and in writing. That he appreciates the situation is shown by
                                his letter. His departure will not, therefore, be delayed beyond the
                                time actually necessary to make his personal arrangements for as
                                long a journey and as extended a stay as is contemplated at
                                Apia.</p>
                            <p>Attention is also invited to what Mr. Chambers has to say regarding
                                the sum to be advanced to him before his departure by the three
                                Governments in equal shares on account of traveling expenses for
                                himself and family.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Chambers refers, as you will perceive, to the correspondence
                                exchanged between yourself and Mr. Blaine on June 13 and 17, 1890,
                                respectively, as to the general policy to be pursued in such
                                cases.</p>
                            <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0489"/>
                            <p>I desire to know the amount to be agreed upon, one-third of which
                                will be borne by this Government. In the case of Mr. Ide the sum
                                finally allowed to him was $2,500. If, however, after the sum shall
                                be fixed, it should be thought more convenient to have this
                                Government advance the whole sum from its available appropriation,
                                it will do so and may be reimbursed by the Governments of Great
                                Britain and Germany by the payment of their respective quotas.</p>
                            <p>I shall be glad to receive at your early convenience an expression of
                                the views of Her Majesty’s Government upon this particular
                                subject.</p>
                            <p>With reference to the suggestion that the consular body, or one of
                                its members, perform the duties of chief justice, to enable Mr.
                                Ide’s departure, in view of the condition of the Samoan finances, I
                                can only say that, in consequence of Mr. Chambers’s expected early
                                departure, it is not thought advisable to adopt the course you
                                suggest even if it were permissible, under the provisions of the
                                Samoan general act concluded at Berlin June 14, 1889, to follow that
                                course.</p>
                            <p>I find, upon reference to that engagement, that Article III, section
                                2, declares that the powers of the chief justice, in case of a
                                vacancy of that office from any cause, shall be exercised by the
                                president of the municipal council until a successor shall be duly
                                qualified and appointed. Again, section 3 of Article II says: “In
                                either case of removal, or in case the office shall become otherwise
                                vacant, his successor shall be appointed as hereinbefore
                                provided”—that is, by the three signatory powers in common accord
                                or, failing therein, by the King of Sweden and Norway.</p>
                            <p>Under these circumstances the Government of the United States can not
                                assent to the suggestion of Her Majesty’s consul, as expressed by
                                Lord Salisbury, that the functions of the chief justice be
                                temporarily confided to the consular body or a single member
                                thereof. The president of the municipal council is the only person
                                authorized in a certain contingency to act temporarily as chief
                                justice, and it is to be remembered that the consular body, because
                                of the departure of Herr von Schmidt and the nonarrival of his
                                successor, Dr. Raffel, so far as the Department is at present
                                advised, is discharging the duties of the president of the municipal
                                council.</p>
                            <p>This Department will do all that it can to hasten the departure of
                                Mr. Chambers, who, with a realization of the situation, will make
                                his arrangements accordingly.</p>
                            <p>I have, etc.,</p>

                                ultimo, and previous correspondence on the subject of the traveling
                                allowance to Mr. Chambers, the new chief justice of Samoa, I have
                                the honor to inform you, by direction of the Marquis of Salisbury,
                                that a note has been received at Her Majesty’s embassy in Berlin
                                from Baron Marschall, the German minister for foreign affairs, dated
                                the 21st ultimo, stating that the Imperial Government have expressed
                                their readiness to agree to a sum of $2,500 being granted for Mr.
                                Chambers’s expenses, and to provide, on their part, for the payment
                                of one third of this sum.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the question which has been raised, whether it would
                                not be desirable in future only to grant the expenses of the return
                                journey from Samoa (except in cases of illness) to the chief
                                justices and <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0490"/>municipal
                                presidents of Apia in case they have held the appointment for at
                                least five years, the German Government admits that it is highly
                                desirable to avoid too frequent changes in these posts, and that,
                                also, in granting compensation for the cost of the return journey,
                                the length of time during which the appointment has been held and
                                the reasons determining the retirement should be taken into
                                consideration. Baron Marschall states that in view of the climatic
                                conditions in Samoa a term of five years seems to be somewhat long.
                                Cases might also arise in which the refusal to grant any portion of
                                the expenses of the return journey, on the ground of short tenure of
                                office or of absence of reasons of health, would involve undue
                                hardship to the officials concerned, and the Imperial Government
                                therefore submit for consideration whether it would not be better to
                                abstain from regulating the matter on principle, and to continue, as
                                heretofore, to decide each case upon its own merits.</p>

                                instant, No. 37, in regard to two sailors belonging to the German

                                police at Metafele, charged with being drunk and disorderly in the

                                subsequently released by direction of the German consul, contrary to
                                any provision of law to that end. It also appears that as early as
                                January last the president of the municipal council at Apia
                                instructed the chief of police that in case any sailors from the

                                of the case to the attention of the Marquis of Salisbury by a note,

                            <p>It would appear from his lordship’s note that a concerted mode of
                                procedure in cases of offenses committed by men from the American,
                                British, and German war vessels had been temporarily agreed upon by
                                the consuls of the three powers interested, and that Her Majesty’s
                                representatives at Washington and Berlin were instructed on the 10th
                                ultimo to ascertain the views of the United States and German

                                    your lordship’s attention to an occurrence at Apia in June last,
                                    in which the action of the Gorman consul-general, apparently
                                    sustained by the president of the municipal council and the
                                    commander of the German war ship <hi rend="italic">Falke</hi>,
                                    appears to have been invasive and subversive of the authority of
                                    the municipal magistrate of Apia and in contravention of the
                                    compiled ordinances for the regulation of the municipal
                                    government of that community.</p>
                                <p>The facts constituting this infraction of the local laws have
                                    been reported to the Department of State by Mr. Churchill, the
                                    United States consul-general at Apia, and are believed to be
                                    correctly set forth in the communication transmitted by him of
                                    Mr. William Cooper, municipal magistrate at Apia, to the Apia
                                    municipal council, a copy of which is herewith inclosed.</p>
                                <p>From this statement it would appear that the action of the German
                                    consul in ordering the release of the alleged offenders of that
                                    nationality, without trial or hearing, was arbitrary and in
                                    violation of existing laws.</p>
                                <p>To preserve in good faith that local autonomy in the government
                                    of Apia which was the declared intent and purpose of the general
                                    regulations agreed upon by the three powers, the jurisdiction of
                                    the municipal council should be carefully sustained, and
                                    cooperative influence of the three treaty powers should be
                                    faithfully exercised to that end.</p>
                                <p>The action of the German consul, sustained by the captain of the
                                        <hi rend="italic">Falke</hi> and the president of the
                                    municipal council, has no discoverable warrant in law, and it is
                                    therefore important that by the joint consent by the three
                                    powers such orders may be made by the three powers to their
                                    respective officials as will prevent in the future the
                                    infringement of the essential right and power of the local
                                    municipal magistrate to enforce the laws for the due
                                    preservation of the peace of the district without interference
                                    by the consuls of either of the treaty powers or of the naval
                                    officers of either power.</p>
                                <p>The duty of the three powers to sustain the municipal government
                                    in the exercise of its allotted functions seems very plain, and
                                    any irregularity <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0492"/>should
                                    be met with their prompt and joint disapproval. An identic
                                    instruction to this effect to the respective consuls of the
                                    three treaty powers, that they should abstain from interfering
                                    in any way with the municipal officers and police in the
                                    execution of their duties in maintaining the public peace would,
                                    it is believed, prevent the recurrence of such acts as I have

                                    relative to the action taken by the German consul in connection
                                    with the arrest at Apia of two sailors belonging to the German
                                    man-of-war <hi rend="italic">Falke.</hi></p>
                                <p>This matter has already been under the consideration of Her
                                    Majesty’s Government.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Cusack-Smith, Her Majesty’s consul in Samoa, reported in
                                    September last that, owing to the incident in question and to
                                    others of a similar nature, the municipal council of Apia had
                                    passed an ordinance intended to deal with the arrest and
                                    imprisonment of seamen belonging to foreign men of-war in Samoan
                                    waters.</p>
                                <p>Her Majesty’s consul and the consuls of the United States and
                                    Germany were of opinion that the provisions of the ordinance
                                    were too cumbersome, and decided to refer the matter to their
                                    Governments for consideration.</p>
                                <p>In communicating this decision to the municipal council they made
                                    the following suggestions: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>Meanwhile the consuls unanimously request that in the
                                            case of an arrest of a man-of-war’s man the president of
                                            the municipal council will at once notify the captain of
                                            the man-of-war concerned, and inform him that if he
                                            sends the necessary guard the prisoner will be handed
                                            over.</p>
                                    </quote></p>
                                <p>The council agreed to this request.</p>
                                <p>The consuls were also unanimous in thinking that under all the
                                    peculiar circumstances relating to Samoa it would avoid friction
                                    in future if the powers would instruct the president in the
                                    sense of the consul’s request, leaving the commander of the
                                    man-of-war concerned to punish all minor infractions of
                                    municipal regulations as he may see fit.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Cusack-Smith presumes that in serious criminal offenses
                                    committed on shore in Samoa a British man-of-war’s man would be
                                    subject to the jurisdiction of Her Britannic Majesty’s high
                                    commissioner’s court, and that, similarly, German and American
                                    men-of-war’s men would be under the criminal jurisdiction of
                                    their respective consulates.</p>
                                <p>The lords commissioners of the Admiralty, to whom Mr. Cusack
                                    Smith’s dispatch was referred, have expressed their concurrence
                                    in the course suggested, and Her Majesty’s representatives at
                                    Washington and Berlin were instructed on the 10th ultimo to
                                    ascertain the views of the United States and German
                                    Governments.</p>
                                <p>Sir Julian Pauncefote and Sir F. Lascelles have not yet reported
                                    the result of their inquiries, and until their replies are
                                    received Her Majesty’s Government propose to defer sending any

                                subject of the 12th ultimo and his reply of the 28th ultimo, to the
                                effect that the municipal council at Apia had passed an ordinance
                                intended to deal with the arrest and imprisonment of seamen
                                belonging to foreign men-of-war in Samoan waters, and which
                                ordinance Her Majesty’s consul and the consul of the United States
                                at Apia were of opinion was too cumbersome. Consequently the matter
                                had been referred to this city and to Berlin to ascertain the views
                                of the Governments of the United States and Germany, which were
                                awaited prior to issuing instructions to Mr. Cusack-Smith, pursuant
                                to this Government’s request.</p>
                            <p>My instructions No. 1368, of December 22, 1896, acknowledged by your
                                No. 857, would have shown you that Mr. Churchill, the (United States
                                consul general at Apia, in his dispatch No. 21, of September 29,
                                1896, presented fully the subject of the proposed ordinance, which,
                                was designated as the “the men-of-war’s men’s offenders ordinance.”
                                It would also have shown you how the Department regarded the subject
                                as disclosed in its instructions to Mr. Churchill, No. 37, of
                                September 21, 1896, copies of both of which were transmitted to you
                                on December 22, 1896. It was in view of the facts recited by Mr.
                                Churchill and of the conclusions reached in the Department’s reply
                                to him of December 21, 1896, that it directed you to say to the
                                British Government that it was unable to find any warrant of law for
                                the action of the German consul or the order of the president of the
                                municipal council, and to suggest that Her Majesty’s Government
                                adopt the necessary means to prevent the recurrence of such
                                arbitrary and unlawful acts in the future.</p>
                            <p>A similar request was preferred to the German Government through your
                                colleague at Berlin.</p>
                            <p>Since then, however, I have received Sir Julian Pauncefote’s note of
                                December 30, 1896, being the one to which Lord Salisbury doubtless
                                refers, and which was answered at length substantially in the sense
                                of Mr. Rockhill’s instruction to .Mr. Churchill of December 21 last.
                                Copies of the British ambassador’s note of December 30 and of my
                                reply of the 16th ultimo were forwarded to you on January 19 by
                                instruction No. 1387.</p>
                            <p>I doubt not that these have reached you and that you have again
                                addressed Lord Salisbury upon the subject, making known to him fully
                                the views of your Government. In case you have not I am persuaded to
                                believe that Sir Julian Pauncefote has furnished his Government with
                                a copy of my note. I trust, therefore, that Her Majesty’s Government
                                will not longer hesitate to address suitable instructions to the
                                British consul at Apia in accordance with the wish expressed in my
                                No. 1368.</p>
                            <p>As of possible interest in this connection I inclose a copy of Mr.
                                Uhl’s dispatch No. 239, of January 13, 1897, presenting the
                                complaint to the German Government.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge
                                the receipt of an extract, which you personally left at the
                                Department a few days ago, from the Marquis of Salisbury’s dispatch
                                to Mr. Cusack-Smith, Her Majesty’s consul at Apia, dated February
                                12, 1897, touching the proposed ordinance for the disposal of
                                members of crews of ships of war who offend against the municipal
                                ordinances and regulations in Samoa, having reference to the one
                                known briefly as “the men-of war’s men offenders ordinance.”</p>
                            <p>It is true that Mr. Olney discussed this subject fully in his note to
                                you, No. 581, of January 16, 1897, and that Mr. Churchill, the
                                consul-general of this Government at Apia, had previously, by
                                instruction No. 37, of December 31, 1896, been made acquainted with
                                the views of this Government respecting the ordinance and the
                                incident that gave rise to it.</p>
                            <p>While the matter, after a full discussion with Mr. Churchill and
                                yourself, was left to his discretion and judgment, yet it was
                                generally intimated that the municipal regulations made pursuant to
                                the general act of Berlin of June 14, 1889, were ample for all
                                practical purposes. Still, because of the views held by the German
                                Government upon this subject, in which Her Majesty’s Government is
                                inclined to concur, I am disposed to believe that a happy solution
                                of the matter may be effected, as Lord Salisbury suggests, “in
                                consultation with the new chief justice, by the consuls of the three
                                powers, who, being on the spot and well acquainted with local
                                requirements, will be able to settle the questions in such manner as
                                to avoid disputes, while at the same time securing the maintenance
                                of order and the proper punishment of offenders.”</p>
                            <p>It will give me pleasure to cause Mr. Churchill to be given copies of
                                the present correspondence and to see that Mr. Chambers, the newly
                                nominated chief justice to Samoa, is promptly supplied by Mr.
                                Churchill with copies of the Department’s recent instructions upon
                                the subject, to the end that the chief justice may ascertain fully
                                the views of this Government in the premises.</p>
                            <p>This Government will cheerfully assent to any conclusion that may be
                                reached after such conference.</p>

                                of M. A. Cheek against Siam is so voluminous that it is physically

                            <p>Estimating a tical to be worth 50 cents in currency of the United
                                States, the whole amount advanced to Cheek by Siam upon the terms
                                set forth in the contracts quoted was $400,000.</p>
                            <p>It appears from Cheek’s memorial that he had, previous to any of
                                these agreements with Siam, leased large tracts of teak forest in
                                Upper Siam, which he needed capital to work. The capital needed was
                                furnished to him by the Government of Siam, as above shown. In
                                explanation of the legal effect of his contracts with Siam Cheek
                                sets forth the usages of the industry upon which he entered in Siam.
                                It requires, according to his statement, about three and a half
                                years to get a log of teak timber from the stump to the market in
                                Bangkok. The logs are first girdled, then cut, and then dragged to
                                the nearest stream by <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0498"/>elephants. Thence they are floated, first singly and afterwards in
                                rafts, down these steams into the main river, which carries them to
                                Bangkok. In the dry season the small streams are too shallow to
                                float the logs, and they lie where they are cut until the arrival of
                                a season of sufficient water to float them.</p>
                            <p>At the time of his agreement with Siam, Cheek had logs in all stages
                                of progress toward the market. At the end of the first year of his
                                contract with Siam he paid the interest for that year upon the money
                                advanced. The second year, ending March 31, 1891, was a dry year and
                                very little timber was got into market. Cheek was compelled to
                                employ the proceeds of his second year’s sales in keeping up the
                                work in the forests, it being necessary to make advances to his
                                employees and subcontractors. In view of these facts the Siamese
                                Government indulged Cheek in consideration of his promise to pay
                                compound interest on the advancement for the second year—that is,
                                the interest due was added to the principal.</p>
                            <p>The next season, ending March 31, 1892, was worse than the preceding,
                                and Cheek failed a second time to pay the interest on the Siamese
                                advancement. The proceeds of his sales for that year were in fact
                                insufficient to keep the forest work going on, and he was compelled
                                to raise additional funds by some means. He had at this time,
                                according to his statement, a sufficient quantity of logs in the
                                forests and in the streams to pay, when sold, the full amount of the
                                advancement made to him by Siam, both principal and interest, and to
                                leave a handsome surplus for himself.</p>
                            <p>Cheek endeavored to get money from the Bombay-Burmah Trading
                                Corporation by a sale for cash of logs to be delivered the following
                                season (1892–93). Since Cheek’s agreement with Siam compelled him to
                                dispose of his logs in a manner therein specified, his proposal to
                                the Bombay-Burmah Trading Corporation required the sanction of the
                                Siamese Government, which was refused. Cheek then sought relief from
                                another lumber company called the Borneo Company, and made with that
                                company a provisional arrangement by which for a reasonable
                                commission, in addition to the actual cost of transportation, that
                                company undertook to transport during the coming season all the teak
                                logs in the water at the time of the negotiation, and all others
                                which Creek might be able to put into the water. He had at that time
                                12,000 logs in the streams and hoped to put in 8,000 more, making in
                                all 20,000 logs to be transported by the Borneo Company. Cheek
                                valued these logs at rupees 48 to 50 each, and he expected to raise
                                on them at least rupees 576,000—estimating the rupee at 33⅓ cents,
                                amounting to about $192,000. This provisional arrangement was also
                                subject to the ratification of the Siamese representative, and was
                                rejected by him.</p>
                            <p>Cheek was then left without funds to pay the interest on the Siamese
                                advance or to continue his work. August 20, 1892, the Siamese
                                Government notified our consul general at Bangkok that all of
                                Cheek’s timber arriving after that elate would be taken over as the
                                property of the Government. At the same time a Government official
                                seized the logs already in Bangkok and others belonging to Cheek
                                which had reached a place higher up the river called Chainat. This
                                official continued to seize logs as they came down. September 11,
                                1892, the Siamese representative telegraphed Cheek, who was up in
                                the forest country: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>Wood received. Will be sold at public auction. Proceeds in
                                        bank until your settlement.</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0499"/>
                            <p>Cheek protested, but in vain.</p>
                            <p>Cheek claims that under his contracts with the Siamese Government, as
                                construed in accordance with the usages of the enterprise in which
                                he was engaged, annual interest was to be paid upon the money
                                advanced to him only when the season had been good and he was able
                                to raft his logs. In bad years the partner or lender who had
                                advanced the capital was required by local custom to let the
                                interest go over until a good season, when all past dues would be
                                liquidated. Failure to pay interest at the end of a year in which it
                                was impracticable to market the timber was not, Mr. Cheek claims, a
                                breach of contract justifying any proceeding in the nature of
                                foreclosure.</p>
                            <p>Cheek makes the further point that the summary method adopted by the
                                Siamese Government was unlawful and injurious to him, even if he had
                                been legally in default.</p>
                            <p>The logs seized by the Siamese Government were sold at auction at
                                much less than their value, and the proceeds appropriated by the
                                Government. The next season, the winter of 1892–93, proved to be
                                favorable for rafting timber, and had Cheek been permitted to go on
                                with his work without molestation from the Government he would have
                                been able to bring down all the logs he had cut, in value, as
                                estimated by him, of rupees 640,000, about $214,000. Even if the
                                logs had been held in Bangkok without sale they could have been used
                                as a basis of credit under Clause III of the agreement, to the
                                extent of rupees 380,000, about $126,666, an amount in excess of all
                                that the Siamese Government could at that time, by any construction
                                of the agreement, have claimed from Cheek. But for this premature,
                                arbitrary, and illegal action of Siam, Mr. Cheek contends, he would
                                have been able to provide for current expenses, to pay off all
                                interest due, and 100,000 rupees of the principal debt, besides
                                keeping up the credit with his foresters and contractors which he
                                had been so many years building up and carefully maintaining.</p>
                            <p>Not content with the summary seizure of all Cheek’s logs that came
                                down the river, the Siamese Government, July 15, 1893, published the

                                        forests, wood in forests and in streams, elephants,
                                        implements for forest work and debtors all and singular as
                                        security for the royal treasury with sundry conditions as
                                        set forth in said agreement.</p>
                                    <p>“Afterwards Dr. M. A. Cheek violated the agreement in many
                                        particulars. Therefore Chow Mun Mahatlek was appointed
                                        commissioner of the royal treasury, with full power of
                                        attorney to act for the minister of finance in the province
                                        of Chiengmai. Therefore, anyone a debtor or creditor of Dr.
                                        M. A. Cheek, or who has charge of elephants or teak wood or
                                        implements for forest work, let him report to Chow Mun
                                        Mahatlek, commissioner at Chiengmai of the royal treasury,
                                        within the period of fifteen days from the date of this
                                        notice. If anyone is a debtor or has charge of elephants or
                                        teak wood or implements for forest work, let him give a
                                        correct report to the commissioner within the time
                                        appointed. The commissioner will deduct, relinquish, forego
                                        a suitable portion (of the debt). If afterwards it be
                                        ascertained that elephants, wood, implements for forest
                                        work, or debtors be concealed, secreted, removed, or falsely
                                        reported, and proper account be not rendered to the
                                        official, the said officer will prosecute in court (such
                                        offender), and they will be fined according to the law.”</p>

                            <p>This embargo completed the demolition of Cheek’s business, and left
                                him a ruined man in the midst of the fourth year of his ten year
                                contract with Siam.</p>
                            <p>The questions which, according to the claimant, are involved are (1)
                                the legal relations of the two parties to the contract—whether Cheek
                                was a partner with Siam or a mere borrower of money; (2) whether
                                Cheek was legally in default at the time the Siamese Government
                                seized and sold the logs and published the manifesto of July 15,
                                1893; (3) whether the Siamese Government adopted a lawful remedy in
                                case it should be found that Cheek was in default and was liable to
                                a legal proceeding for the recovery of money due that
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>In relation to the third point, it is contended for Cheek that the
                                local law of Siam provided an adequate judicial remedy against him;
                                and that the consular court of the United States was also a forum
                                clothed with powers ample for the purpose of enforcing his
                                obligations to Siam. The summary method of proceeding resorted to by
                                Siam was Cheek claims, in violation of Siamese law and also of the
                                treaty between Siam and the United States. Cheek’s losses are
                                estimated by him at rupees 1,607,331 ($535,777). From this amount he
                                deducts the principal and unpaid interest of the Siamese advancement
                                to him, amounting to rupees 1,266,218, leaving a total claimed by
                                Cheek as damages of rupees 341,113 ($113,704).</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">the Siamese reply.</hi></p>
                            <p>The Siamese Government has filed an elaborate reply to Cheek’s claim,
                                and alleges large indebtedness on the part of Cheek’s estate as
                                still existing and unpaid. According to the statement of Siam, Cheek
                                was deeply in debt when the Siamese Government came to his relief in
                                1889. A considerable portion of the 800,000 ticals advanced to him
                                was paid to his creditors and the residue thereof was applied to the
                                timber business. On his first failure to pay interest (March 31,
                                1891) he was given as a favor another year in which to pay it. At
                                the end of the second year (March 31, 1892) Cheek not only was
                                unable to pay the accrued interest for the two preceding years, but
                                he had not sufficient funds to continue the business, and was unable
                                to raise money except by methods which involved the Siamese
                                Government as his surety. Seeing that his financial condition was
                                hopeless and that the only means of obtaining repayment of even a
                                part of the money advanced to him was by immediate action, the
                                Siamese Government decided to seize such timber as should come down
                                the river and apply the proceeds to the indebtedness. The argument
                                for Siam apologizes for, rather than defends, the order of July 15,
                                1893, which placed an embargo upon Cheek’s business and destroyed
                                it.</p>
                            <p>Siam’s view of the case is apparently that when Cheek violated the
                                conditions on which money was advanced to him by failing to pay the
                                interest accrued thereon, the transfer of property made in the “bill
                                of sale mortgage” became absolute, so that Siam in seizing the logs
                                seized the property of the Government, and not the property of
                                Cheek. It is declared in the Siamese argument that there is no law
                                of mortgages in Siam, and therefore no procedure in the nature of
                                foreclosure; that seizure and appropriation by an officer of the
                                royal treasury was the legitimate and the only method of enforcing
                                the rights of Siam as against Cheek in this case.</p>
                            <p>Cheek had, besides the logs seized by Siam, other property in upper
                                Siam, which was also included in the “bill of sale mortgage.” This
                                    <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0501"/>property was not seized
                                by the Siamese Government, and when Cheek died it went into the
                                hands of his administrator. Siam contends not only that the seizure
                                of Cheek’s logs and the other acts of the Government were lawful,
                                but that the proceeds derived therefrom were insufficient to pay
                                Cheek’s indebtedness to Siam. The property now in the hands of
                                Cheek’s administrator is claimed by Siam as being subject to the
                                “bill of sale mortgage” above referred to, and responsible for the
                                amount of indebtedness still unliquidated. In other words, Siam has
                                presented a counterclaim against Cheek.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch, No. 137, of August 19,
                            1896, in relation to the claim of Dr. M. A. Cheek against the Siamese
                            Government, has been received.</p>
                        <p>In this and in previous dispatches the Government of Siam has expressed a
                            desire to have the matter of this claim submitted to arbitration, on
                            condition that the Siamese counterclaim against the estate of Dr. Cheek
                            shall be included in the submission and considered by the arbitrator.
                            The Siamese claim against Cheek is supposed to relate to an unpaid
                            balance of Cheek’s indebtedness to that Government, which was not
                            liquidated by the appropriation of Cheek’s property under royal order in
                            1892 and 1893, which act of appropriation is the subject-matter of
                            Cheek’s complaint.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Cheek made his claim for damages against the Siamese Government
                            subject to deduction of the amount which he—or his estate, now that he
                            is dead—owes that Government. The proposition of Siam is therefore
                            assumed to be that in case the arbitrator shall find that Cheek’s
                            indebtedness to Siam exceeds the amount of damages awarded him in
                            consequence of the injurious action of the Siamese Government, the
                            arbitrator shall have authority to make an award against Dr. Cheek’s
                            estate in favor of the Siamese Government for the amount of such
                            excess.</p>

                            correspondence passed between the foreign minister and myself in regard
                            to the question raised in your esteemed No. 79 in regard to the
                            arbitration of the Cheek case.</p>
                        <p>After receiving your instructions, as intimated in my 150, of December
                            23, I pressed the foreign minister for an answer, with what result you
                            now see.* * *</p>
                        <p>I hardly feel as if I am warranted in cabling as much as it would appear
                            would be necessary to explain the latest attitude of Siam. I shall try
                            again to get a briefer and more explicit reply to your question, but if
                            I fail I may only cable you that the Siamese Government desires you to
                            await the receipt of the inclosed letters.</p>
                        <p>I have, as the correspondence will prove, to have them cable their
                            consul-general their full answer if they did not feel like making it
                            briefer for me, but now the foreign minister claims a misunderstanding,
                            and seems to oppose any cabling.</p>
                        <p>In my reply which I shall send to the foreign minister’s arguments about
                            former propositions of arbitrations, etc., I shall feel constrained
                            almost to inform him that rehashing old contentions already extensively
                            and exhaustively discussed is not pertinent, nor is it of any advantage.
                            * * *</p>

                                formal note covering the matter then under discussion—a certain
                                phase of proposed arbitration of the Cheek case.</p>
                            <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0503"/>
                            <p>I will now provide you with an extract from instructions received by
                                me from the Honorable Richard Olney, Secretary of State of the
                                United States, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>* * * The Government of Siam has expressed a desire to have
                                        the matter of his claim submitted to arbitration on
                                        condition that the Siamese counterclaim against the estate
                                        of Dr. Cheek shall be included in the submission and
                                        considered by the arbitrator. The Siamese claim against
                                        Cheek is supposed to relate to an unpaid balance of Cheek’s
                                        indebtedness to that Government, which was not liquidated by
                                        the appropriation of Cheek’s property under royal order in
                                        1892 and 1893, which act of appropriation is the
                                        subject-matter of Cheek’s complaint.</p>
                                    <p>Dr. Cheek made his claim for damages against the Siamese
                                        Government subject to deduction of the amount which he (or
                                        his estate, now that he is dead) owes that Government. The
                                        proposition of Siam is therefore assumed to be that in case
                                        the arbitrator shall find that Cheek’s indebtedness to Siam
                                        exceeds the amount of damages awarded to him in consequence
                                        of the injurious action of the Siamese Government the
                                        arbitrator shall have authority to make an award against Dr.
                                        Cheek’s estate in favor of the Siamese Government for the
                                        amount of such excess.</p>
                                    <p>You are instructed to ascertain from the Siamese minister of
                                        foreign affairs and to report at once whether the suggestion
                                        of the Siamese Government is rightly understood in the sense
                                        above explained.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur le Ministre</hi>: I have the honor to
                                acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant providing
                                me with an extract from instructions received by you and relating to
                                the proposed arbitration of the Cheek case.</p>
                            <p>I stated with pleasure that the principle of settling this case by
                                arbitration, which I proposed in the name of His Majesty’s
                                Government, is admitted by the Government of the United States. As
                                to the question whether the suggestion of the Siamese Government is
                                rightly understood in the sense explained in the dispatch of the
                                Honorable Richard Olney, whereof you kindly transcribe an extract, I
                                regret to say that I can not accept the expressions “appropriation
                                of Cheek’s property” as corresponding with the views of His
                                Majesty’s Government on their own action, and that I can not
                                consider as correct the following assumption of Siam’s proposition:
                                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>That in case the arbitrator shall find that Cheek’s
                                        indebtedness to Siam exceeds the amount of damage awarded to
                                        him, in consequence of the injurious action of the Siamese
                                        Government, the arbitrator shall have an authority to make
                                        an award against Dr. Cheek’s estate in favor of the Siamese
                                        Government for the amount of such excess.</p>

                            <p>If this assumption were accepted by my Government as a right
                                explanation of their views, it would follow that Ave admit as well
                                founded Dr. Cheek’s complaint of an alleged “injurious action” of
                                this Government, <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0504"/>and his
                                claim for damages on his account. I, on the contrary, am bound to
                                state that His Majesty’s Government never made such admission, and
                                that the very first question which we propose to submit to
                                arbitration is whether the action of this Government in attaching
                                timber mortgaged to them as the only means of getting back their
                                advances was or was not justified by Dr. Cheek’s own repeated
                                breaches of contract, and consequently whether Dr. Cheek is entitled
                                in principle to claim any damages on account of said action.</p>
                            <p>It is only when this first question will have been decided by the
                                arbitration court that it will be possible to decide whether and for
                                what amount the balance of all accounts between this Government and
                                Dr. Cheek (or Dr. Cheek’s estate) is in favor of the former or of
                                the latter.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur le Ministre</hi>: I am afraid that
                                there was some misunderstanding between us about the result of our
                                conversation of the 24th instant. I had no idea of sending any
                                cablegram to our consul-general, except to assist you in
                                communicating with your own Government. I thus agreed that if you
                                would show me how you would wire briefly to your Department of
                                State, and referring to my cablegram to our consul-general at New
                                York, I could oblige you by going to the expense of telegraphing
                                fully the statement of our views.</p>
                            <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0505"/>
                            <p>As for myself, I can only repeat that I do not feel the necessity of
                                telegraphing at all to our consul-general. His Majesty’s Government
                                are certainly anxious to arrive at the constitution of the
                                arbitration court, and as proof of their earnest wish in this
                                respect I beg to remark that when the idea of an arbirration was
                                emitted nearly three years ago by Mr. Eaton, acting consul-general
                                of the United States, in a letter which he addressed to me on the
                                21st of January, 1893, I at once accepted the proposal. The matter
                                might thus have been considered as settled between both Governments
                                nearly three years ago if Dr. Cheek had not simply refused to agree
                                with this mode of just and friendly settlement. Since then the
                                proposal of arbitration was renewed by His Majesty’s Government more
                                than one year ago, and repeatedly insisted on in my letters to you.
                                But it is only on the 14th instant that you intimated your
                                Government’s acquiescence to the idea. This seems to indicate that,
                                at least in the opinion of your Government, there is no such urgency
                                in the case that we should recur to an expensive exchange of
                                telegrams about the terms in which the case for Siam was stated in
                                your letter of the 14th instant. I therefore beg to propose that you
                                inform his excellency the Secretary of State that there is some
                                difference between his statement of our case and ours, and that you
                                send him by the next mail copy of our correspondence.</p>
                            <p>May I ask you by the same opportunity if you have already received
                                instructions about the way in which your Government proposes to
                                constitute the arbitration court and the procedure to be
                                followed?</p>
                            <p>Accept, etc.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Acting on your telegraphed instructions of
                            February 17, various suggestions were made as to the selection of the
                            arbitrator. While the governor of the Straits Settlement might have been
                            accepted, it was thought best to secure a distinguished jurist, if
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>I presented the name of Sir Nicholas J. Hannen, British chief justice and
                            consul-general at Shanghai. The foreign minister at once accepted, and
                            we agreed to address him a joint note asking him to serve. We hope to
                            telegraph or write him within a few days.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, if Sir Nicholas J. Hannen will consent to act, we will be
                            assured of an able and impartial arbitrator. He ranks as one of the most
                            capable jurists in the Far East, is an authority on extraterritoriality
                            and international law, and has a thorough knowledge of Asiatics.</p>
                        <p>The foreign minister held that the arbitrator should sit in Siam. While I
                            thought that this should be left to the arbitrator, I saw that objection
                            to the wish would prolong discussion, and hence yielded. We will
                            therefore suggest to the arbitrator that he sit here in November or
                            December. Before that date climatic conditions would hardly warrant us
                            in asking him to come to Siam. It also gives sufficient time to make
                            full arrangements without undue haste.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to await, any further instructions and trust that you
                            will be good enough to forward them at your earliest convenience, as it
                            is my desire to have all details settled before going to Cheangmai in
                            June or July to investigate the Kellett matter.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor, etc.,</p>

                            dispatches Nos. 171 and 176, dated, respectively, February 18 and March
                            2, 1897, reporting that you have practically closed the terms of
                            arbitration of the Cheek case, I confirm my cablegram to you of
                            yesterday’s date as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Numbers 171 and 176 received. Suggestions approved. Model of

                        <p>It appears from your reports that the instructions of the Department have
                            been complied with, and that the terms of agreement are satisfactory. I
                            inclose copy of a protocol or agreement between the United States and
                            Mexico, signed March 2, 1897, for the settlement of a claim, which will
                            serve as a guide to you in framing the agreement for the arbitration of
                            this matter between the Siamese Government and Cheek. The previous
                            correspondence so fully covers the case that there is no occasion to
                            give you special directions. The three essentials are: <list>

                        <p>Sir Nicholas J. Hannen, British chief justice and consul-general at
                            Shanghai, China, is perfectly satisfactory to this Government as the
                            arbitrator, and there is no objection to his sitting in Siam.</p>
                        <p>You have in your office duplicates of all the papers concerning the case
                            which are on file here, and this relieves the Department from sending
                            you copies of the documents here. If you need any, however, cable for
                            them and they will be sent immediately.</p>
                        <p>You will notice that in the Mexican case, the protocol of which is
                            inclosed, the two parties have contented themselves with submitting to
                            the arbitrator the documents and correspondence which have already
                            passed between them with such additional arguments as each may choose to
                            make. I am not sufficiently well acquainted with the conditions to
                            advise you to follow this precedent in that respect. It may be that
                            valuable evidence is attainable by you which has not already been
                            submitted. If so, it would be well to make the agreement broad enough to
                            admit such evidence. If, on the other hand, the papers which have
                            already been presented contain all there is in favor of Cheek’s case,
                            the agreement may be framed accordingly. The Department refrains from
                            hampering you with specific instructions which may do more harm than
                            good.</p>
                        <p>Trusting that your intelligence and perfect familiarity with the case
                            will enable you to make a proper agreement, you are hereby authorized to
                            draw up and sign the same as representative for the United States in
                            this matter, but before the agreement becomes operative, a copy of it
                            must be sent here for approval. If approved, you will be notified by
                            cable. In the meantime you may be preparing the case for submission to
                            the arbitrator, and on receipt of notice that the agreement to arbitrate
                            is satisfactory to both Governments the arbitrator may proceed with the
                            case.</p>

                            letters exchanged with Mr. George Greville, British minister, and with
                            his royal highness the foreign minister, in regard to the expenses and
                            honorarium of the arbitrator in the Cheek case, Sir Nicholas Hannen.</p>
                        <p>The substance of the correspondence is that Sir Nicholas Hannen thinks
                            that, for the convenience of all parties, it would be best to include
                            expenses and honorarium in one fee of 10 guineas a day for the time he
                            is necessarily absent from Shanghai, to which the Siamese foreign
                            minister and myself have, of course, agreed.</p>
                        <p>According to Sir Nicholas Hannen’s arrangements and our own, it would
                            appear that the arbitration court would sit about the 13th of December.
                            The arbitrator is due to arrive in Singapore on December 8, and should
                            reach here approximately on the 13th. His absence from Shanghai will
                            probably be from fifty to sixty days, making his total fee from $2,500
                            to $3,000, of which, according to your instructions, the United States
                            will pay half.</p>

                                honorarium should be included in one fee.</p>
                            <p>Sir N. Hannen thinks that 10 guineas a day, during such time as he
                                may be necessarily absent from Shanghai, will be a proper fee for
                                him to charge.</p>
                            <p>This fee will cover everything, unless Sir N. Hannen should be

                                that on my part I see no objection to the terms mentioned in the
                                note of Mr. George Greville, who has also kindly written to me an
                                identical note on the same subject, except that whatever may be the
                                stipulations expressed therein, our agreement is that we each share
                                one-half of all the expenses and fees of Sir N. Hannen, till further
                                understanding.</p>
                            <p>I have therefore written to the British minister resident, accepting
                                in my own name as well as yours, the terms of Sir N. Hannen, and I
                                inclose the letter opened under this cover, so that you may send it,
                                if you will kindly do so, when you send your reply to Mr. George

                                acknowledge the receipt of your esteemed note of June 19, informing
                                me of the terms which his excellency, Sir Nicholas Hannen, Her
                                Britannic Majesty’s chief justice and consul-general at Shanghai,
                                who has accepted the invitation of His Royal Highness Prince
                                Devawongse, the Siamese foreign minister, and myself to act as
                                arbitrator in the Cheek case, deems will be for the convenience of
                                all parties, viz, that expenses and honorarium should be included in
                                one fee of 10 guineas a day during such time as he may be
                                necessarily absent from Shanghai.</p>
                            <p>I beg to state that such terms are perfectly acceptable to the United
                                States Government, and to the Cheek estate, and I am informed in a
                                letter from his royal highness, the Siamese foreign minister,
                                written in response to one of inquiry from me, that they are also
                                acceptable to the Siamese Government.</p>
                            <p>He is good enough to forward, through me, his reply to a letter of
                                yours addressed to him on the same subject, which you will find
                                inclosed.</p>
                            <p>You will please therefore be good enough to telegraph his excellency,
                                Sir Nicholas Hannen, accordingly, as kindly proposed by you.</p>
                            <p>The time which he suggests coming to Bangkok would appear agreeable
                                to all parties. If unexpected conditions cause any modification of
                                plans, we will duly notify him through your kind offices.</p>
                            <p>It may be of interest for me to state that I have just received full
                                instructions from my Government, as to the formal protocol to be
                                drawn up between the Siamese and the United States Governments
                                covering this agreement, and I shall, at a very early date,
                                negotiate with the foreign minister on the matter. As soon as it is
                                duly signed, we shall be pleased to provide you with a copy to be
                                forwarded to his excellency, Sir Nicholas Hannen.</p>
                            <p>If at any time, he or you desires further information on any point, I
                                am sure that either the Siamese foreign minister or myself will be
                                glad to acquaint you with such.</p>
                            <p>Expressing on behalf of my Government, which is taking great interest
                                in this case, its pleasure in his excellency, Sir Nicholas Hannen’s
                                acceptance of the position of arbitrator, in which I know likewise
                                the Siamese Government joins, and thanking you for the assistance of
                                yourself and Mr. Archer in making arrangements,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that the
                            Siamese foreign minister and myself, after communication with Sir
                            Nicholas J. Hannen, and the Cheek estate, have postponed the date of
                            arbitration in the Cheek case to February 1, 1898. I trust that this
                            date will be acceptable to the Department, as it is to all others
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>As can be seen by correspondence inclosed in my No. 221, of this date,
                            the postponement was readily arranged. The reasons for this step,
                            founded on conditions explained in my 216, and authorized in
                            Department’s telegram of July 13, can be briefly summarized as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>In consequence of the Department’s instructions, Mr. Kellett must remain
                            here until my return from Cheangmai. Supposing I am able to leave within
                            the next ten days, I shall not reach Cheangmai until approximately
                            August 31.</p>
                        <p>The work to be done at Cheangmai can hardly be accomplished in less than
                            fifteen days.</p>
                        <p>Returning with all speed I may be able to get back by October 1, as one
                            can come down in about one-half the time required to go up.</p>
                        <p>Supposing Mr. Kellett leaves for Cheangmai one week after my arrival, he
                            will not reach Cheangmai until about November 10.</p>
                        <p>To get the evidence, which is apparently of greatest importance, he will
                            require nearly two months in and out of the forests, and could not leave
                            Cheangmai until well into January and hence not reach Bangkok until the
                            last of January.</p>
                        <p>The Siamese foreign minister agreed with me as to the necessity of this
                            delay, as otherwise the administrator (through Mr. Kellett) could not
                            possibly make a definite report on the administration of the Cheek
                            estate during this year in response to the Siamese Government’s demand
                            that the administration of the estate be included in the
                            arbitration.</p>
                        <p>We first asked Sir Nicholas J. Hannen to agree to a postponement until
                            February 15, 1898, but as February 1 is his latest date we have agreed
                            thereto.</p>
                        <p>I would simply add that I should have started for Cheangmai long before
                            this, were it not for the characteristic slowness of the Siamese
                            Government in negotiating the Cheek protocol.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor, etc.,</p>

                            adviser, the points at issue until perfect accord was attained; and
                            although the Siamese Government consumed nearly four weeks in preparing
                            to sign the protocol, it finally yielded to my representation, enabling
                            the foreign minister and myself to affix this day our signatures
                            thereto, which we did with reciprocal expressions of kindly feelings and

                                arbitrator of the claims of the late Marion A. Cheek (or of the
                                estate of said Marion A. Cheek) against the Government of His
                                Majesty the King of Siam, and of the Government of His Majesty the
                                King of Siam against the late Marion A. Cheek (or the estate of said

                            <p>His Majesty the King of Siam and the United States of America,

                                United States of America, have agreed upon and signed the following
                                protocol:</p>
                            <p>Whereas the .United States of America, on behalf of the late Marion
                                A. Cheek, a citizen of the United States (or of the estate of said
                                Marion A. Cheek), have claimed indemnity from the Government of Siam
                                for arbitrary, unjustifiable, and other injurious action alleged to
                                have been taken against the said Marion A. Cheek by the Government
                                of Siam; and whereas the Government of Siam denies either the
                                allegations of fact or contentions of law on which the claims of the
                                other party are based, or the right of the other party to demand
                                indemnity on account of such facts and contentions of law, and holds
                                that in any case said Marion A. Cheek’s liabilities to the Siamese
                                Government, eventually including the amount of damages that might be
                                awarded to Siam in consequence of the injurious action of said
                                Marion A. Cheek or of the administrator of his estate (which
                                injurious action is denied by the other party) exceeds the amount of
                                damages that might be awarded to said Marion A. Cheek, or his
                                estate, in consequence of the injurious action of the Government of
                                Siam; it is therefore agreed between the two Governments, with the
                                consent of the administrator of the estate of Marion A. Cheek:</p>
                            <p>I. That every matter of dispute, both facts and law, brought into
                                issue between the two parties shall be referred to the decision of

                                and for what sum, the Government of Siam is indebted to the estate

                            <p>V. Reasonable compensation to the arbitrator and the other common
                                items of expense attending to the hearing of the case by the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In addition to my consular dispatch No.
                            37, entitled “Important concession granted to an American by the Siamese
                            Government,” as being a matter of commercial interest, I have the honor
                            to call the Department’s attention to the matter in a dispatch.</p>
                        <p>The granting of the concession of the absolute electric-lighting
                            privileges for twenty years of Bangkok and suburbs, representing a
                            population of over half a million, and spread over a large area, by the
                            Siamese Government to Mr. Lawrence E. Bennett, an American civil
                            engineer, I consider one of the most noteworthy evidences of what
                            American energy can accomplish in the Far East, if the opportunity is
                            appreciated and developed in the proper way.</p>
                        <p>There has been so much discussion of prospective concessions to Americans
                            in China and other countries of Asia, that I am pleased to have this one
                            actually obtained and put into practical working in the country to which
                            I have the honor to be accredited.</p>
                        <p>Especially is it gratifying to me, and I hope to the Department of State,
                            that this concession is granted within one month after the adjustment of
                            recent difficulties with the Siamese Government. It is material evidence
                            that American influence has not suffered, and that the opportunity for
                            Americans of energy, reliability, and capital in Siam has not been
                            unfavorably affected by recent events.</p>
                        <p>Had American companies or American interests made earlier and stronger
                            efforts, in accordance with repeated previous reports and
                            recommendations of mine, other concessions and other opportunities for
                            the development of commerce, trade, and general business could have been
                            secured and seized, which have gone into the hands of companies and
                            representatives from European countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bennett has won his concession by showing to the Siamese Government
                            that it would gain rather than lose by the transaction and by proving
                            that he could do what was expected as well as, or better, than anyone
                            else. It is also the result of hard, persistent endeavor on his part and
                            of competition with others for the valuable rights granted. As United
                            States minister I have given him such moral support as was permissible
                            and legitimate, and I am confident that the policy that I have followed
                            here under your esteemed direction has been such as to enable the
                            Siamese Government to place confidence in any relations they may have
                            with Americans now or in the future. There is, of course, very much to
                            be desired yet in the way matters are managed by the Siamese and in the
                            promulgation of improvements of all kinds—the upbuilding of trade and
                            commerce with foreign lands—but I am hopeful that experience and
                            observation will prove to the Siamese Government the advantage of
                            development and progress. They deserve credit, however, for having done
                            much that commends itself to foreigners.</p>
                        <p>Finally, as suggested by Mr. Bennett’s concession, I would urge through
                            the Department of State, what I have said many times before, that now is
                            the time for American material interests in the far East to be built up
                            from Japan to Java. One of the greatest opportunities of the world is
                            here. Great Britain, Germany, and France are competing <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0516"/>more hotly everyday for the chief share
                            of its growing business and trade. Their merchants, exporters, steamship
                            companies, and commercial representatives are leaving no stone unturned
                            to thoroughly exploit the fields open in Japan, China, Siam, and
                            neighboring lands and colonies. May Americans awake to the situation
                            before it is too late.</p>

                            case of Adolphus Torres, I have the honor to inform you of the receipt
                            of a note from the Spanish minister of state informing me that according
                            to information furnished by the Governor-General of Cuba the facts
                            relative to the arrest of Torres are as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>On the 4th of October last the military commander of Sagua la
                                    Grande was confidentially informed that several neighbors of
                                    that town had absented themselves with a commission for the
                                    insurgents. Said authority therefore proceeded to their
                                    detention on their return, and with them was Adolfo Torres. The
                                    necessary proceedings were then instituted to find out whether
                                    the place where they had gone and the purpose of their absence
                                    constituted an offense of rebellion. These points were
                                    justified, and the confidential report not having been proved
                                    the case was considered as ended, in accordance with the opinion
                                    of the auditor-general, on the 12th of November and the liberty
                                    of the detained was ordered. The question of competence or of
                                    application of the protocol of 1877 was not discussed, because
                                    the condition of American citizenship had not been claimed by
                                    any of the prisoners. The decision in the case was afterwards
                                    communicated to the consul-general of the United States at
                                    Havana.</p>

                            receipt of a note from the minister of state, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>From the documents sent by the Captain-General of the Great
                                    Antille it appears that said Suarez del Villar, a neighbor of
                                    Cienfuegos, was arrested on the 8th of September last in the act
                                    of delivering a sum of money in payment of certain arms which
                                    appeared to have been sold to the insurrection. Proceedings were
                                    begun which afterwards were raised to a criminal case, because
                                    the act in question constituted an offense of aid to the
                                    insurrection. By a protest of the consular agent of the United
                                    States at Cienfuegos, knowledge was had that Suarez del Villar
                                    was an American citizen, and in view of this, after legal proofs
                                    were exhibited in due form and the proceedings and necessary
                                    requisites were fulfilled, on the 5th of last January the case
                                    was turned over to the civil jurisdiction, and the proceedings
                                    were delivered to the judge of instruction of Cienfuegos.</p>
                                <p>It is therefore evident that this case, far from being an
                                    infringement of the protocol of 1877 and other international
                                    agreements in force, is another proof of the loyalty with which
                                    the same are fulfilled by the Spanish authorities in the Great
                                    Antille.</p>

                            American citizen, Charles Scott, arrested in Cuba by reason of the
                            present insurrection, and of whom on several occasions your excellency
                            has spoken to me, I have the honor to bring to your knowledge that,
                            according to official reports which are communicated to me by the
                            minister of state, the said Charles Scott was detained at Regla on the
                            9th of the present month because it appeared from the process set on
                            foot against other persons that he was a spy and agent of the
                            subcommittee and delegate of the Junta there established for the purpose
                            of collecting funds destined for the insurrection. Scott forthwith
                            confessed his guilt, although alleging extenuating circumstances.</p>
                        <p>The same day on which Scott was arrested the consul of the United States
                            asked for information concerning his detention, and on the 15th he was
                            sent evidence of the charges which appeared against the accused.</p>
                        <p>On the 19th the consul asked that the order of “incommunication” be
                            removed from Scott.</p>
                        <p>On the 24th it was ordered that, as a result of the proceedings and upon
                            the recommendation of the regional governor, the case should be
                            transferred to the ordinary courts, which orders were communicated to
                            the consul of the United States, Scott remaining in jail.</p>
                        <p>The official reports which I have received in this matter conclude by
                            stating that the military jurisdiction has not intervened in the
                            case.</p>

                            who received me yesterday at 5 o’clock. At its close I had the honor to
                            send you the following cablegram in cipher: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    contained in your cablegram of January 22. He said that he
                                    cabled immediately for reports in each case, which are now
                                    arriving by mail. From data in hand says charges have been made
                                    in the three cases of which you complained on that account. In
                                    every case says proceedings are going in according to law and
                                    protocol, and will do all possible to hasten them. Cuban
                                    authorities say Jose Gonzales has not claimed to be American
                                    citizen. Witnesses now being examined in case of Larrieu.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I confirm on the overleaf copy of my
                            cipher telegram of yesterday protesting against the further detention in
                            Cuba of tobacco purchased or contracted for by mercantile houses in the
                            United States prior to the issuance of the decree forbidding its
                            exportation.</p>
                        <p>The attention of this Department has, for several months past, been
                            called to the very great injury caused by the persistent refusal of the
                            Spanish authorities to fulfill the promises made to this Government and
                            release from the embargo all tobacco in the provinces of Havana and
                            Pinar, the property of citizens of the United States at the time the
                            said embargo was ordered by the Captain-General of the Island. The
                            damages which may be ultimately awarded to such citizens for this
                            detention of their property are of minor importance compared with the
                            great injury which is now occasioned by the lack of materials for their
                            factories in this country. The retention of this tobacco in Cuba does
                            not operate in favor of the native manufacturers and the embargoed
                            merchandise will, within a short time, become useless. In this
                            connection I inclose copy of a letter from Messrs. Hernsheim Bros, and
                            Co., of New Orleans, filed in this Department by Mr. William O.
                            Roome.</p>
                        <p>In conversation with the Spanish minister at this capital, the above
                            considerations and suggestions on the same lines were submitted to him,
                            and he assured the Department that he would at once cable to the Madrid
                            Government to promptly dispose of all these cases which are now on
                            appeal there from Cuba.</p>

                            12,000 bales of tobacco—the exportation of which was refused by the
                            Cuban authorities—were contracted for and purchased by the company’s
                            agent at Havana prior to May 16, 1896.</p>
                        <p>The original of the inclosed affidavit has been forwarded to the

                            rested upon general statements unsupported by proof. It was also

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            dispatch No. 685, of the 22d ultimo, accompanied by a translation of a
                            note from the Duke of Tetuan, of April 20, in relation to the case of
                            Messrs. Hernsheim Brothers, who state that they purchased and contracted
                            for a certain quantity of tobacco prior to the decree of May 16, 1896,
                            prohibiting its exportation from the provinces of Havana and Pinar del
                            Rio. I have attentively read the views expressed by the Duke of Tetuan,
                            but I deem it unnecessary at the present time to do more than to inclose
                            certain additional evidence, and to refer to his gratifying promise,
                            upon the arrival of the expediente at Madrid, in the Hernsheim Brothers
                            and other tobacco cases, to cause the case of those brothers to be
                            instantly and “carefully examined by the Government of His Majesty, with
                            the firm purpose of deciding in strict equity and justice.”</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the expediente referred to by the minister may have
                            before this reached Madrid, but as pertinent to the consideration of the
                            case, should the expediente not have reached there, and the case not
                            have been decided, I inclose original and copies of letters from Fidel
                            Fernandez, the buyer, and original letters from Messrs. Neuhaus, Neumann
                            &amp; Co., the agents of Messrs. Hernsheim Brothers &amp; Co., all
                            bearing <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0525"/>on the purchase of the
                            tobacco prior to May 16, 1896. The former correspondence covers
                            seventeen letters and the latter thirteen letters and two
                            cablegrams.</p>
                        <p>Nothing in the inclosed correspondence shows that copies thereof have
                            been submitted to the Havana authorities, but inquiry on this point will
                            be made of the firm and the suggestion made to it that this course be
                            followed in case it has not been.</p>
                        <p>Still, this should not deter you from promptly presenting copies of these
                            papers, sent in original to the minister of state, and from renewing
                            your appeal that the Spanish Government, in fulfillment of its promise,
                            should instantly deal with the case in accordance with equity and
                            justice. If the owners of the tobacco are to receive it in fairly good
                            condition it should be released without further and unnecessary delay.
                            The Spanish Government will, I am sure, realize this, and will do all
                            that it reasonably can to expedite a favorable decision.</p>
                        <p>In case such decision is reached at Madrid you may briefly telegraph the
                            fact.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, it may be well to refer you to Mr. Olney’s No. 654, of
                            February 12 last, in which the case of Messrs. Hernsheim Bros. &amp; Co.
                            is specifically mentioned.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In connection with the Department’s
                            instructions No. 699, of the 12th instant, I have now to inclose for
                            your use a copy of a letter from Mr. Samuel Herman, dated this city, the
                            28th instant, covering a translation of the memorial of Messrs. Neuhaus,
                            Neumann &amp; Co., of Havana, to the Captain-General of Cuba, dated May
                            20, 1897, and a translation of a certified copy of proceedings
                            instituted by that firm in the court of first instance at Havana in May,
                            1897, all having reference to the case of Messrs. S. Hernsheim Bros.
                            &amp; Co., Limited, of New Orleans, whose tobacco is embargoed
                            there.</p>
                        <p>It is the hope of the Department that these papers, in case those
                            heretofore submitted shall not have convinced the Spanish authorities at
                            Madrid of the fact that the tobacco was ordered and purchased prior to
                            the order of General Weyler of May 16, 1896, will show conclusively the
                            bona fides of the transaction and result in an immediate order releasing
                            the tobacco.</p>
                        <p>The Department is inclined to this belief not only on account of the
                            evidence now and previously submitted, but because of the assurance
                            given by the Duke of Tetuan in his note of April 20, 1897 (transmitted
                            with your No. 685, of April 22), that the expediente relative to
                            Hernsheim Brothers and the other tobacco cases was expected to reach
                            Madrid very soon, and that then the case of Messrs. Hernsheim Bros.
                            &amp; Co. would be carefully examined by the Spanish Government in
                            accordance with equity and justice.</p>
                        <p>You will promptly bring these facts to the attention of the Spanish
                            Government, should it be necessary, upon the arrival of this
                            instruction, and urge a speedy and favorable decision, telegraphing
                            briefly the result.</p>

                            May 28, 1897, I have now to inclose copy of a document, in Spanish,
                            showing that the manufacturers of tobacco and cigars in Havana
                            acknowledge that Messrs. S. Hernsheim Bros. &amp; Co., Limited, of New
                            Orleans, are the owners of 1,200 bales of tobacco, purchased prior to
                            the decree of May 16, 1896.</p>
                        <p>I add a copy in translation of this document as it has been furnished to
                            the Department.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that with this information before it, taken in connection
                            with the previous proofs which you have been instructed to present, the
                            Spanish Government will be willing to issue the necessary orders for the
                            release of the tobacco in question. I can not but believe that the
                            reexamination of the case, foreshadowed in your No. 699, of May 21,
                            1897, has been made at Madrid, and if so, I am equally confident that
                            the release of the tobacco will follow.</p>
                        <p>I desire that you again present the case to the Spanish Government in the
                            light of this additional evidence if necessary, and urge upon that
                            Government the propriety of immediate and favorable action.</p>

                            Johnson, attorneys for Sartorius &amp; Co., of New York, who are the
                            owners of some 719 bales of tobacco purchased or contracted for in the
                            Island of Cuba prior to the issue of the Governor-General’s prohibitory

                        <p>Permission to ship this tobacco has been refused, and you are instructed

                            this you will see that four of the seven of these cases, including that
                            of Hernsheim Brothers, have already been decided favorably, and that in
                            the three remaining cases further proof may be offered in Cuba in order
                            to supply the deficiencies which now exist. I can therefore take no

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: ln accordance with what I had
                                the honor to state to you on several occasions, the Government of
                                His Majesty has carefully examined the expedientes received from the
                                Island of Cuba, formed on account of the claims made by several
                                American citizens relative to the decree on the exportation of
                                tobacco from Havana and Pinar del Rio published by General Weyler
                                under date of May 16, 1896.</p>
                            <p>Grave and well-grounded considerations of just defense of the
                                national interests suggested the publication of that order; but the
                                Government of His Majesty, always respecting the rights acquired,
                                showed itself disposed to exempt from the same those lots of tobacco
                                which should be sufficiently proved that had been bona fide acquired
                                or contracted for by foreigners prior to the publication of the
                                decree. So I informed that legation in official note as soon as,
                                after the Government of His Majesty had taken such decision, your
                                excellency presented the first observations upon the matter, under
                                date of May 21, 1896. Afterwards and in different notes I have had
                                the honor to make the same statement to you. From the beginning, and
                                as Your Excellency will remember, the case was foreseen that
                                difference of opinions might arise as to the manner of carrying out
                                the instructions already sent, the decisions being reserved to the
                                agreement of both Governments.</p>
                            <p>For the purpose of putting a definitive end to this matter the
                                Government of His Majesty, giving another proof of its special
                                desire to please, as far as possible, that of the United States,
                                requested the authorities of Cuba to send copies of the expedientes
                                there formed on account of the mentioned American claims regarding
                                the exportation of tobacco. As soon as said copies have been
                                received by the Government it has proceeded to their study and
                                decision with its habitual spirit of equity and justice.</p>
                            <p>Seven have been the American claimants whose expedientes have been
                                received by His Majesty’s Government and to which yogi excellency
                                has referred in different notes, viz: (1) Bruno Diaz, (2) Doroteo
                                Herrera, (3) Luis Wertheimer, (4) Federico Bauriedel, (5) Seidenberg
                                &amp; Co., (6) Hernsheim Bros. &amp; Co., and (7) Sartorius &amp;
                                Co.</p>
                            <p>Of these seven cases the first three, as your excellency knows, have
                                been already decided by granting the permission to ship requested by
                                the claimants. For that reason the Government of His Majesty needs
                                not enter into the examination of their respective expedientes, and
                                will do so exclusively in regard to the four others.</p>
                            <p>These four offered to prove that they acquired or contracted for the
                                tobacco prior to the decree, but the only one who actually proves it
                                with the documents presented is the claimant Hernsheim Bros. &amp;
                                Co., especially with those documents which your excellency was good
                                enough to transmit as inclosures to your notes of May 15 and 21 and
                                4th instant, especially the letters of the buyer Fidel Fernandez, a
                                Spaniard, which being dated prior to the decree, are truly
                                convincing and bear effective proving power.</p>
                            <p>In view of them the Government of His Majesty, in compliance with its
                                primitive decision contained in my note of the 25th of May last
                                year, has ordered the Cuban authorities to permit the shipment of
                                the 1,200 bales of tobacco the property of Messrs. Hernsheim Bros.
                                &amp; Co., sending the instructions by cable in order to avoid
                                unnecessary delay.</p>
                            <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0529"/>
                            <p>As the same circumstances do not concur in regard to the value of the
                                proofs alleged in the three remaining cases, the decision has been
                                necessarily different. Messrs. Bauriedel, Seidenberg, and Sartorius
                                do not prove, but limit themselves to offer, in one or other form
                                that they shall prove, their assertions that they acquired or
                                contracted for the tobacco prior to the decree. For this purpose and
                                in accordance with their offers it will be necessary to open an
                                investigation by means of the examination of the commercial books,
                                correspondence, memoranda, notes, confirmation of drafts,
                                depositions of the sellers, buyers, and selecters, and other means
                                which may be considered proper; the purpose of which investigation
                                will be to clear the facts and to purge them with a severity
                                excluding good faith, equity, and justice. This investigation shall
                                be made at Havana, because neither in the expedientes nor in the
                                documents sent by your excellency appear sufficient evidence to
                                appreciate duly the proofs offered and reasons alleged. According to
                                the result of the investigation the permission for shipment shall be
                                given or not, it being understood that before said shipment is
                                permitted it is necessary to demonstrate that the tobacco is the
                                same one which was acquired or contracted for prior to the
                                decree.</p>
                            <p>As regards the case of Messrs. Bauriedel &amp; Co., the investigation
                                shall refer, not to the total quantity originally requested, but
                                only to the 5,000 bales of tobacco, these being the only ones they
                                offer to prove, in a petition of September 10, 1896, that were
                                acquired or contracted for prior to the decree.</p>
                            <p>Resuming, the Government of His Majesty, after making a careful study
                                of the respective expedientes and of the documents submitted by your
                                excellency, has decided— <list>
                                    <item>First. To authorize the immediate shipment of the 1,200
                                        bales of tobacco requested by Messrs. Hernsheim Bros. &amp;
                                        Co., of New Orleans, issuing to this end the proper orders
                                        by cable.</item>
                                    <item>Second. To order the Treasury authorities of the Island of
                                        Cuba to make the proposed investigations or those which may
                                        be considered necessary to prove whether Messrs. Bauriedel,
                                        Seidenberg, and Sartorius acquired or contracted for, bona
                                        fide, prior to the order, the respective amounts of 5,000,
                                        600, and 750 bales of tobacco, which they desire to ship,
                                        and if they are the same which they acquired or contracted
                                        for prior to the decree. The matter of the permission to
                                        ship shall be decided according to the result of the
                                        proof.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>As your excellency will see, the decision of the Government of His
                                Majesty is inspired both in the equity and justice promised, which
                                is the constant feature of its conduct, and in a desire to please as
                                far as it can that of the United States, thus answering to the
                                friendly sentiments uniting both countries.</p>
                            <p>Said decision is very specially based upon the last documents
                                presented by your excellency in official notes, some of them of a
                                very recent date, and upon the express text of the depositions
                                presented by the claimants. The Government of His Majesty has acted
                                with as much dispatch as circumstances permitted since the receipt
                                of your note of the 24th of March last, ordering the remission of
                                the expedientes from the Island of Cuba and keeping them in its
                                hands only the time indispensable for their examination. If the
                                exportation is only permitted in one case, it is because that is the
                                only one in which the assertion of the bona fide acquisition prior
                                to the order is confirmed: and this is due, not to the documents
                                presented by the claimant at Havana, but to those submitted by your
                                excellency in your notes, the last of which was of the 4th instant.
                                The Government of His Majesty <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0530"/>could not be, therefore, more solicitous,
                                contrasting its rapid action with the scanty diligence employed by
                                the claimants.</p>
                            <p>The latter, instead of using the right of administrative appeal
                                granted by the Spanish law, and which would have enabled the central
                                Government to decide the matter much sooner, preferred to go
                                to-the-diplomatic channel, slower and less adequate, thus bringing
                                about delays and annoyances imputable only to the claimants, and for
                                which the Government of His Majesty can not answer at all, as I had
                                the honor to state to your excellency in my note of April 24 of the
                                present year.</p>
                            <p>Of that fault and of the delay with which the parties interested have
                                presented the documents of proof may have originated losses, in case
                                they have existed; and as of them His Majesty’s Government has not
                                been the cause, it can not admit the existence of any right to
                                indemnity, as that claimed without sufficient ground by Messrs.
                                Sartorius &amp; Co. I must therefore so inform your excellency,
                                hoping that the Government of the United States will appreciate in
                                their full value the reasons exposed, which, being based upon strict
                                justice, will not fail to merit its approval and respect.</p>
                            <p>After the claims of American subjects in regard to the decree of May
                                16, 1896, have been definitively decided in the manner above set
                                forth, and the refusal to admit, any demand for indemnity which on
                                that account might be presented has been justified, it only rests
                                for me to state to your excellency my conviction that in view of the
                                time elapsed no new claims may be presented with foundation, since
                                it is more than a year that the exportation of tobacco from Havana
                                and Pinar del Rio has been prohibited, and therefore there has been
                                ample time for the presentation of complaints of those who should
                                consider their interests injured. The Government of His Majesty, for
                                this reason, has the pleasure of considering this matter as
                                definitively ended.</p>

                            714of June 25 last, inclosing further evidence relative to the claim of
                            Sartorius &amp; Co. to be allowed to ship certain tobacco from Havana,
                            you state that in view of the Duke of Tetuan’s note inclosed in your No.
                            716 of June 25 last, declaring that no further tobacco claims would be
                            received, you had decided not to present the claim without further
                            instructions from the Department.</p>
                        <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0532"/>
                        <p>The expression used in the Duke of Tetuan’s note is that no new claims
                            would be received (nuevos casos de reclamacion). The case of Sartorius
                            &amp; Go. was not a new case; it had been forwarded to your legation in
                            Department’s No. 686 of April 23 last, and it was one of the subjects of
                            the very note under consideration, it being declared therein that the
                            evidence submitted up to that time was insufficient to prove the case.
                            Department’s No. 714 inclosed this additional evidence, which, according
                            to the statement made by Messrs. Hoadley, Lauter-bach &amp; Johnson in
                            their letter of June 8 to Hon. L. E. Quigg (copy inclosed in No. 714),
                            had been filed with General Weyler at Havana on June 2 last, and, it was
                            promised, would be forwarded to Madrid on June 20. This evidence of
                            course could not have been before the Spanish Government on June 23,
                            when the Duke of Tetuan’s note was dated.</p>
                        <p>In view of these facts I therefore telegraphed you on the 21st instant
                            (telegram confirmed on overleaf) to ask for information and a favorable
                            decision in the light of the additional evidence presumed to have been
                            forwarded from Havana on June 20 last.</p>
                        <p>You should at once submit the evidence inclosed in Department’s No. 714,
                            and ask for a favorable decisioh.</p>

                                of tobacco of Messrs. Sartorious &amp; Co.</p>
                            <p>In reply to said note I have to inform your excellency that the only
                                communication relative to this matter which I have received after my
                                note of the 23d of June is yours of the same date, which was
                                received by me on the following day, inclosing a certificate from
                                the manufacturers of tobacco of Havana, stating that said Messrs.
                                Sartorius, together with Messrs. Hernsheim, were the only American
                                claimants who had not sold the leaf tobacco object of their claim.
                                In due time I sent said certificate to the minister of ultramar and
                                surely it will be kept iu mind by the Governor-General of Cuba when
                                he decides the case, according to the agreement.</p>
                            <p>I have hastened, however, to communicate to my colleague the minister
                                of ultramar the note of your excellency to which I answer.</p>
                            <p>I avail myself, etc.,</p>

                            the mayor refused to permit him to telegraph in cipher on official

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have just received a telegraphic
                            dispatch from the United States consul at Santiago de Cuba, dated
                            yesterday, and informing me that a protest has been lodged with him by
                            the master of the American mail steamship <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi>, chartered by the Ward line of New York and regularly
                            sailing under its house flag, alleging that when leaving Guantanamo Bay
                            for Santiago de Cuba, his ship was fired upon by the Spanish warship <hi rend="italic">Reina Mercedes</hi>, then 2 miles eastward and astern
                            of the <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi>, the first shot being blank and
                            the second a solid shot striking 80 yards astern. Upon hoisting her flag
                            the <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi> was not further molested.</p>
                        <p>I can not comprehend such an exceptional demonstration against a vessel
                            well known in the local trade, belonging to a line which has for years
                            maintained regular commercial intercourse at stated periods with the
                            ports of Cuba, and leaving port on a legitimate voyage and in compliance
                            with all the requirements of Spanish law. It becomes my duty to ask
                            instant investigation of this apparently extraordinary interference with
                            legitimate commerce, and that the proper measures be taken to prevent
                            the occurrence of such incidents.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have had the honor to receive
                            the note you wrote me, under the date of 29th instant, informing me that
                            you had received a telegram from the United States consul at Santiago de
                            Cuba reporting a demonstration of the Royal cruiser <hi rend="italic">Reina Mercedes</hi> against the steamer <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi>, of the Ward line.</p>
                        <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0537"/>
                        <p>Acceding to your excellency’s desires, I had already written asking for
                            information as to this occurrence, when I received last night a telegram
                            from the Duke of Tetuan, who is always in the habit of communicating to
                            me whatever news may be of interest to this legation, in which telegram
                            he recites one addressed by the minister of marine to the commandant
                            general of the Havana naval station.</p>
                        <p>According to that telegram, the incident occurred in the following
                            manner: As she was entering the bay of Guantanamo, the cruiser <hi rend="italic">Reina Mercedes</hi> met at the mouth of the harbor a
                            steamer which was coming out without flying her flag, although the war
                            ship had one hoisted. The latter, following the practice of all navies,
                            confirmed her flag by firing a gun, and after the regular interval had
                            passed she fired another shot, shorewards, from the bow of the
                            cruiser.</p>
                        <p>At the second shot the steamer, which the cruiser had already recognized
                            as being the <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi>, hoisted the American flag
                            and went on her way without being molested. (See for explanation Spanish
                            minister’s note, June 29, 1897.)</p>
                        <p>As your excellency will see by this simple statement of facts, which .is
                            in concurrence with the reports made to you by the United States consul
                            at Santiago de Cuba, there was no exceptional demonstration. The
                            practice followed by international maritime law has been followed by
                            indicating or advising, in the form usual with all war navies, that a
                            breach of courtesy was being committed.</p>
                        <p>If the steamer <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi> had hoisted her flag upon
                            meeting in Spanish waters a ship of the royal navy, the latter would
                            have had no need of notifying her by means of a cannon shot, neither
                            would it have been necessary to fire the second if the first had
                            sufficed.</p>
                        <p>I permit myself to invite your excellency’s attention to that which I had
                            the honor to write to the Department under your worthy charge in my note
                            of February 18 of last year (1896).</p>
                        <p>After repeated breaches of courtesy by the steamers of the line to which
                            the <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi> belongs, I asked in my note to the
                            Government of the United States, through the medium of the Secretary of
                            State, that it should take notice of these facts and call the attention
                            of the ship-owners thereto, thus aiding the Government of His Majesty
                            the King of Spain in its purpose to avoid every kind of pretext for
                            disagreement; and now, in view of the present incident, I permit myself
                            to renew the request.</p>
                        <p>As I said in my aforesaid note of February 18, 1896, His Majesty’s
                            cruisers have very strict orders for the fulfillment of their duties,
                            and have received very precise instructions to avoid all disagreeable
                            incidents. It is just, therefore, that all provocation be likewise
                            avoided, and the wish to see fulfilled the duty of courtesy to which I
                            allude could not be deemed capricious when so many filibustering
                            expeditions have set forth and are setting forth from the United States,
                            and when the vigilance confined to the 3 miles of jurisdictional waters
                            is so difficult.</p>
                        <p>I doubt not that the foregoing explanations will leave your excellency
                            completely satisfied by convincing you that there has not been, in will
                            or in deed, any extraordinary interference with legitimate commerce nor
                            any other wish than to affirm a right which under present circumstances
                            it becomes indispensable to insist upon for the better vigilance of the
                            territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>I take advantage of this occasion, Mr. Secretary, to repeat, etc.,</p>

                            the navy and a judge-advocate of the same arm to proceed to Santiago de
                            Cuba and inform themselves of what took place.</p>
                        <p>As I had the honor to state to your excellency yesterday, and according
                            to confirmation by later intelligence which has been communicated to me
                            for my information by the minister of state, the shots were not fired at
                            an American vessel, but at an unknown vessel without a flag; the second
                            shot was the consequence of the first one not having been heeded, and as
                            soon as she hoisted her flag she was allowed to continue on her voyage
                            without molestation and without even exercising the right of search,
                            which all nations have in their jurisdictional waters.</p>

                            receipt of your two notes of the 31st ultimo and 1st instant, both being
                            responsive to mine of the 29th ultimo, in regard to the reported
                            incident of the shots fired at the American merchant steamer <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi> as she was leaving the Bay of
                            Guantanamo, in Cuba, by the Spanish cruiser <hi rend="italic">Reina

                        <p>As your second note advises me that the investigation which I requested
                            has been in fact ordered, and in view of certain apparent discrepancies
                            in the details of the incident as they are stated in your several notes,
                            I will defer further consideration of the matter until I shall be in

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your two notes of the 31st
                            ultimo and 1st instant, in relation to the firing upon the American
                            steamer <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi>, near Guantanamo, by the Spanish
                            cruiser <hi rend="italic">Reina Mercedes</hi> on the 27th of May last, I
                            have now the honor to acquaint you with the result of the investigation
                            as to the facts, made by this Department.</p>
                        <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0539"/>
                        <p>It is ascertained that the incident occurred not in the narrow entrance
                            to Guantanamo Bay, as would seem to be stated in your notes, but in the
                            ocean waters at the mouth of that inlet, and within 3 miles of the Cuban
                            coast. The <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi> having duly cleared from
                            Guantanamo and saluted the fort, which lies inland some 5 miles north of
                            the ocean mouth of the inlet, took down her ensign and proceeded on her
                            voyage. As she left the channel and was rounding Punta de Sotavento,
                            heading southwestwardly, she sighted the <hi rend="italic">Reina
                                Mercedes</hi> approaching from the eastward, then being some 2½
                            miles distant, and southeast by east of Punta de Barlovento, which had
                            until then concealed the cruiser from view. The <hi rend="italic">Reina
                                Mercedes</hi> was, from the course she steered, necessarily bow on,
                            as seen from the <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi>, and so remained, or
                            very nearly so, during the whole occurrence. Her ensign, if displayed at
                            the gaff, was not visible from the <hi rend="italic">Valencia’s</hi>
                            position then or at any time during the incident. No signal being seen,
                            and inasmuch as the vessels were not passing each other, the cruiser
                            being abaft the beam of the <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi> on the port
                            quarter, the captain of the latter did not believe himself required to
                            salute the cruiser with his flag, as he would have done had he met her
                            on regular course. The two ships being in this relative situation, the
                            first shot was fired and was heard on the <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi>, but was not, for the reasons stated, supposed to be
                            a call for colors. Almost immediately after—within two minutes—another
                            shot was heard, followed by the fall of the projectile nearly in line
                            with the <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi> and about 80 yards astern of
                            her. Thereupon, realizing that the shots were intended, for him, the
                            captain of the <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi> at once hoisted his
                            national flag; but even then no flag or signal was visible upon the
                            cruiser, which was then south by west of Punta de Barlovento, heading
                            west, and about 2 miles astern of <hi rend="italic">the Valencia</hi>,
                            which had now swung into her westerly course in the open sea. The
                            captain of the <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi>, however, recognized the
                            cruiser as being the <hi rend="italic">Reina Mercedes</hi>, the two
                            vessels having been together at Santiago de Cuba on the 7th and 8th of
                            May last—a circumstance which also explains the statement in your note
                            of May 31 that the cruiser recognized the <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi> when firing upon her.</p>
                        <p>It further appears that the <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi> does not
                            belong to the Ward line, but to the “Red D “line between New York and La
                            Guaira, having been temporarily chartered from Messrs. Boulton, Bliss
                            &amp; Dallett by Messrs. James E. Ward &amp; Co., to take the place of
                            the regular south-side liner <hi rend="italic">Niagara</hi>, which was
                            laid up for repairs. Her officers and crew remained under the “Bed D
                            “management during these Cuban trips, and her master seems to have been
                            unadvised of the correspondence of February and March of last year
                            concerning the failure of the <hi rend="italic">Santiago</hi> to salute
                            a passing Spanish cruiser. Even had the master of the <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi> been aware of the former incident, I am by no means
                            certain that the circumstances under which the <hi rend="italic">Reina
                                Mercedes</hi> was sighted by him would exact the usual maritime
                            courtesy of the flag. At any rate, I am satisfied that no discourtesy
                            was intended by the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi>, and
                            that if he indeed erred, it was an excusable error of judgment on his
                            part. However this may be, I am prepared to admit, in all frankness,
                            that during the continuance of a civil war such as is now flagrant in
                            the Island of Cuba, it would be extremely convenient, and perhaps a
                            prudent precaution, for American ships legitimately resorting to Cuban
                            waters to show their flag when sighting a Spanish cruiser within the
                            3–mile limit, even if a formal salute be not called for by the ordinary
                            code of maritime ceremonial, and I shall so advise Messrs. James E. Ward
                            &amp; Co.</p>
                        <p>With this statement the incident may be dismissed, but I can not <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0540"/>refrain from commenting upon
                            the recklessness of the Spanish commander’s action. Upon your own
                            showing, knowing the vessel to be the <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi>
                            and in the temporary service of the Ward Line, and apparently moved by
                            feeling toward that line because of supposed discourtesies suffered from
                            other of its ships in the past, he fired upon the <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi> for no other purpose than to make her show her flag.
                            How far this confessedly careless act comports with the interests and
                            dignity of two great and friendly nations it is not necessary to
                            consider, but the fact remains that the falling of a solid shot near the
                            stern of an American ship under such circumstances imports wanton and
                            unjustifiable peril to the citizens and property of a friendly state.
                            This Government has never admitted that life and property may be
                            unnecessarily jeopardized by superior force, even when an offense
                            against the revenue or other formal laws may have been committed by an
                            American ship within a foreign jurisdiction, and it can not be expected
                            to admit that one of its ships or those on board may be endangered
                            because of a friendly foreign commander’s ideas as to maritime
                            punctilio. I must therefore repeat the hope expressed in my note of the
                            29th ultimo that such disagreeable incidents as this be not suffered to
                            recur.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have received your note of the
                            21st instant, in reply to mine of May 31 and of the 1st instant,
                            relative to the shots fired near Guantanamo by His Majesty’s cruiser at
                            the American steamer <hi rend="italic">Valencia.</hi></p>
                        <p>Congratulating myself that the reports received by both Governments have
                            clearly explained what took place, and that those received by your
                            excellency have led you to inform me, as you have done, that the matter
                            may be considered as terminated, and again assuring you that the
                            commanders of the vessels which patrol the coasts of Cuba have received
                            orders to avoid, as far as their duties will permit, giving any trouble
                            to those of friendly nations and to commerce carried on in good faith, I
                            deem it my duty to establish the accuracy of certain statements made
                            owing to an erroneous interpretation of my words, which statements have
                            served as a basis for certain assertions made by your excellency in your
                            note of the 21st.</p>
                        <p>If I said that the incident took place in the Boca de Guantánamo, it; was
                            because those same words were used by Mr. Pulaski F. Hyatt, in his
                            communications of May 23 and 28, the former of which was addressed to
                            the commandant of marine and the latter to the local governor of
                            Santiago, and they were the words that were telegraphed to me.</p>
                        <p>Twice in your aforesaid note your excellency seems to infer from my
                            words, which are, indeed, ambiguous, that the cruiser <hi rend="italic">Reina Mercedes</hi> fired on the <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi>
                            knowing that that was the vessel of which she was in pursuit. The word
                            reconoció is not used as synonymous with conoció (knew), but in the
                            military sense of making an examination, which the commander of the
                            cruiser, in the telegram communicated to me by the Duke of Tetuan, says
                            was made with a spyglass after the flag had been hoisted.</p>
                        <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0541"/>
                        <p>I go into these details in order that the charge may not stand against a
                            vessel belonging to our navy that it deliberately, and from a mere
                            capricious point of honor, did all that your excellency says.</p>
                        <p>This point being cleared up, there only remains an act, which, although
                            it is not a serious one, should not be repeated, and will doubtless not
                            be repeated, if the captains obey the instructions which your excellency
                            has so prudently suggested, and if the commanders of war vessels obey

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the conversation which the
                            Assistant Secretary, Mr. Day, had the honor to have with you on the 8th
                            instant, it now becomes my duty, obeying the direction of the President,
                            to invite through your representation the urgent attention of the
                            Government of Spain to the manner of conducting operations in the
                            neighboring Island of Cuba.</p>
                        <p>By successive orders and proclamations of the Captain-General of the
                            Island of Cuba, some of which have been promulgated while others are
                            known only by their effects, a policy of devastation and interference
                            with the most elementary rights of human existence has been established
                            in that territory tending to inflict suffering on innocent
                            noncom-batants, to destroy the value of legitimate investments, and to
                            extinguish the natural resources of the country in the apparent hope of
                            crippling the insurgents and restoring Spanish rule in the island.</p>
                        <p>No incident has so deeply affected the sensibilities of the American
                            people or so painfully impressed their Government as the proclamations
                            of General Weyler, ordering the burning or unroofing of dwellings, the
                            destruction of growing crops, the suspension of tillage, the devastation
                            of fields, and the removal of the rural population from their homes to
                            suffer privation and disease in the overcrowded and ill-supplied
                            garrison towns. The latter aspect of this campaign of devastation has
                            especially attracted the attention of this Government, inasmuch as
                            several hundreds of American citizens among the thousands of
                            concentrados of the central and eastern provinces of Cuba were
                            ascertained to be destitute of the necessaries of life to a degree
                            demanding immediate relief through the agencies of the United States, to
                            save them from death by sheer starvation and from the ravages of
                            pestilence.</p>
                        <p>From all parts of the productive zones of the island, where the
                            enterprise and capital of Americans have established mills and farms,
                            worked in large part by citizens of the United States, comes the same
                            story of interference with the operations of tillage and manufacture,
                            due to the systematic enforcement of a policy aptly described in General
                            Weyler’s bando of May 27 last as “the concentration of the inhabitants
                            of the rural country and the destruction of resources in all places
                            where the instructions given are not carried into effect.” Meanwhile the
                            burden of contribution remains, arrears of taxation necessarily keep
                            pace with the deprivation of the means of paying taxes, to say nothing
                            of <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0542"/>the destruction of the
                            ordinary means of livelihood, and the relief held out by another bando
                            of the same date is illusory, for the resumption of industrial pursuits
                            in limited areas is made conditional upon the payment of all arrears of
                            taxation and the maintenance of a protecting garrison. Such relief can
                            not obviously reach the numerous class of concentrados, the women and
                            children deported from their ruined homes and desolated farms to the
                            garrison towns. For the larger industrial ventures, capital may find its
                            remedy, sooner or later, at the bar of international justice, but for
                            the labor dependent upon the slow rehabilitation of capital there
                            appears to be intended only the doom of privation and distress.</p>
                        <p>Against these phases of the conflict, against this deliberate infliction
                            of suffering on innocent noncombatants, against such resort to
                            instrumentalities condemned by the voice of humane civilization, against
                            the cruel employment of fire and famine to accomplish by uncertain
                            indirection what the military arm seems powerless to directly
                            accomplish, the President is constrained to protest, in the name of the
                            American people and in the name of common humanity. The inclusion of a
                            thousand or more of our own-citizens among the victims of this policy,
                            the wanton destruction of the legitimate investments of Americans to the
                            amount of millions of dollars, and the stoppage of avenues of normal
                            trade—all these give the President the right of specific remonstrance;
                            but in the just fulfillment of his duty he can not limit himself to
                            these formal grounds of complaint. He is bound by the higher obligations
                            of his representative office to protest against the uncivilized and
                            inhumane conduct of the campaign in the Island of Cuba. He conceives
                            that he has a right to demand that a war, conducted almost within sight
                            of our shores and grievously affecting American citizens and their
                            interests throughout the length and breadth of the land, shall at least
                            be conducted according to the military codes of civilization.</p>
                        <p>It is the President’s hope that this earnest representation will be
                            received in the same kindly spirit in which it is intended. The history
                            of the recent thirteen years of warfare in Cuba, divided between two
                            protracted periods of strife, has shown the desire of the United States
                            that the contest be conducted and ended in ways alike honorable to both
                            parties and promising a stable settlement. If the friendly attitude of
                            this Government is to bear fruit it can only be when supplemented by
                            Spain’s own conduct of the war in a manner responsive to the precepts of
                            ordinary humanity and calculated to invite as well the expectant
                            forbearance of this Government as the confidence of the Cuban people in
                            the beneficence of Spanish control.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my previous notes touching
                            the effects of the policy of concentrating the rural population in the
                            garrison towns as an incident to the Spanish military operations in the
                            Island of Cuba, I have the honor to advise you that official reports
                            from the United States consular representatives in that quarter show
                            that the mortality among the “concentrated” citizens of the United
                            States who are receiving necessary relief in Sagua la Grande and Santa
                            Clara for the months of June and July was over 3 per cent, thus
                            approximating in two <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0543"/>months to
                            the normal death rate of a whole year. An increase of this appalling
                            mortality is to be expected during the more sickly approaching month of
                            September as the result of a repressive policy which I have had the
                            honor to describe and characterize in my preceding notes.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the conversation had by you
                            with the Assistant Secretary a few days since in relation to the
                            character of the measures taken by the Spanish authorities in Cuba to
                            concentrate the rural population in towns where, deprived of all means
                            of subsistence and thrown upon communities incapable of affording them
                            aid, pestilence and famine could not fail to spread disease and death
                            among them, I have now, by direction of the President, the honor to
                            communicate to you precise particulars reported by the agents of the
                            United States in the Island of Cuba.</p>
                        <p>In Matanzas since the 1st of October ultimo deaths from actual starvation
                            among the reconcentrados have rapidly and alarmingly increased over the
                            already large proportions of such deaths during the nine months
                            preceding. Between January 1 and October 1 of the current year over
                            2,000 persons, whose names are listed, have died in the city of Matanzas
                            alone from want of food. Since the latter date the daily average death
                            rate there has been over 45 persons, although prior to the accumulation
                            of reconcentrados in that town the normal death rate was 6 persons
                            daily, not including soldiers. On the 10th of October, for example, 62
                            died in Matanzas, of whom 57 perished for lack of food.</p>
                        <p>In the interior towns of the province of Matanzas the situation is
                            described as being beyond belief. In some towns from one-third to
                            one-half of the population has disappeared.</p>
                        <p>The number of deaths from actual starvation is unquestionably
                            underestimated, owing to the obvious impossibility of ascertaining the
                            facts in every case of death. A conservative estimate, compiled from
                            reliable sources, gives the number of deaths in the Province of Matanzas
                            and outside the city of that name from starvation and the diseases
                            incident thereto as being over 22,000 persons since the present policy
                            was inaugurated.</p>
                        <p>The local authorities are represented to be powerless to cope with the
                            situation. The cities and towns are virtually bankrupt, and can give no
                            appreciable relief to the starving thousands forced upon them.</p>
                        <p>These facts but substantiate the representations which reach this
                            Government from other quarters of the island. They abundantly justify
                            the earnest representations which this Government has felt constrained
                            to make in the common cause of humanity and justice. It is no merely
                            sentimental or interested consideration which moves this Government to
                            raise its voice in earnest remonstrance against so harsh and so futile a
                            policy as this, which, to the inevitable hardships and woes of war,
                            superadds extermination by starvation.</p>
                        <p>The situation bears no analogy to the case heretofore suggested by you of
                            the sufferings caused in a besieged town. These innocent agriculturists,
                            their wives and children, have been herded by the act of the <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0544"/>military commanders within towns
                            unbesieged and wholly within Spanish control, without provision for
                            their wants and without any apparent effort to alleviate the inevitable
                            consequences of destitution, lack of shelter, and disease.</p>
                        <p>With the change of military rule in the Island of Cuba, and in view of
                            the manifested purpose of the Spanish Government to promote reforms
                            therein consonant with the beneficent purposes of a metropolitan
                            government toward a distant, rich, and populous dependency, the
                            President happily anticipates that the condition of things of which this
                            Government has been too often constrained to speak will disappear.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: In response to your note dated
                            the 6th instant, I have the honor to state to you that, being desirous
                            of knowing the measures adopted with respect to the reconcentrados, and
                            impressed, as I could not but be, by the agitation which for obvious
                            motives is kept up by the press, besides being aware that the
                            instructions given to General Blanco by His Majesty’s Government, a
                            summary of which has been made public, contains especial and positive
                            references to such reconcentrados, I inquired by telegraph what measures
                            had been adopted or were under consideration with a view to adoption,
                            and the Governor-General of the Island of Cuba, while stating that he
                            can not send the text of the decrees (bandos) by telegraph, because of
                            their great length, says to me that—</p>
                        <p>Extensive zones of cultivation have been organized; food is furnished to
                            them daily by the State; work is allotted to them; they will be well
                            treated; they may be employed by the proprietors of estates
                            (hacienda-dos); they will be furnished means of transportation; they are
                            being looked after and protected with solicitude and care; provincial
                            protective boards have been planned and are already organized, and these
                            will continue to be organized in the provinces where they may not yet be
                            working, which boards are charged with the procurement of resources for
                            providing for their needs. Subscriptions have been started with this
                            same object, and finally, everything that can humanly be done is being
                            done.</p>
                        <p>The Governor-General likewise states to me that a decree has been
                            promulgated which not only permits agricultural operations, harvesting
                            of crops, etc., but counseling the same and offering due protection
                            thereof, both civil and military; that not a moment is being lost in
                            giving heed to all present necessities, and that he is occupying himself
                            with all these things and giving to them personal attention with
                            especial interest.</p>
                        <p>In the short time that has elapsed since the change of policy took place,
                            it has been and is impossible to do more, and with the greater reason
                            inasmuch as it is needful that, in addition to official action, private
                            charity should come to aid in diminishing the sufferings caused by the
                            war, since to cause the return, without sufficient precautions, of the
                            reconcentrados to their homes would only increase their sufferings
                            instead of diminishing them.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: This Department is in receipt of
                            dispatches from United States consuls in Cuba clearly indicating that,
                            notwithstanding the efforts being made in that direction by the new
                            Captain-General looking to the relief of the condition of the people
                            known as reconcentrados, a great amount of distress and suffering still
                            prevails, resulting in many cases in death. This condition the Spanish
                            authorities seem powerless to relieve. There is reported lack of
                            provisions, medicines, and other necessaries to adequately care for the
                            needy and suffering.</p>
                        <p>The President feels very strongly that this condition should be promptly
                            relieved. The devastating warfare which prevailed under the former
                            Administration has left the island in such an impoverished condition
                            that relief by local authorities or means seems impracticable, no matter
                            what good intentions may actuate the new Administration. It seems
                            imperative that provision for the prompt relief of these people must be
                            sought elsewhere. The President feels sure that in this distressing
                            situation the American people will be quick to respond to an appeal to
                            their charitable instincts, and, if permitted so to do, will be found
                            ready and willing to contribute the necessary means to relieve the
                            distress and save the lives of these unfortunate people. To that end it
                            is respectfully suggested that provisions may be admitted to Cuba free
                            of duty and a hearty cooperation given by the Spanish authorities in
                            Cuba to measures for the distribution of food, clothing, and medicines
                            for the relief of the people suffering for lack of such assistance. May
                            we not have from your Government a speedy assurance of hearty
                            cooperation in these just measures of relief, which appeal so strongly
                            to our feelings of humanity and sympathy for these suffering people?</p>
                        <p>I shall be happy to meet you and discuss the details of such measures of
                            relief as are herein indicated, at your earliest convenience.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Upon my return to Washington I lost no
                            time in taking up the subject of the measures of charitable relief which
                            may practicably be adopted to effect the benevolent purpose of
                            distributing to the reconcentrados and other sufferers in Cuba of food,
                            medicine, and clothing, as intimated in your note of December 6.</p>
                        <p>As I find was said in the Department’s provisional acknowledgment of
                            December 8, this important subject has been receiving the President’s
                            consideration. Acting under his suggestion, I beg to inquire whether it
                            would not be possible forthwith to enlist in this humane endeavor the
                            admirably organized machinery of the Red Cross Association of the United
                            States, of which Miss Clara Barton is the honored head. The efficient
                            assistance which that association has heretofore rendered in relieving
                            widespread distress and distributing the charitable contributions of
                            American citizens to that end are doubtless well known to you and would,
                            moreover, furnish a guarantee of the due application of such generous
                            relief as would respond to an appeal of the President or of the
                            Secretary of State to the American people. With Miss Barton and her
                            trained assistants on the spot I think that not only would a very
                            general response follow such an appeal, but that the distribution of
                            relief in cooperation through organized Spanish channels and by such
                            direct channels as may be available, the double purpose of doing the
                            greatest possible good with the least possible loss of time would be
                            accomplished.</p>
                        <p>If this suggestion has your concurrence, of which my conversations with
                            you on the subject have already virtually assured me, I shall be most
                            happy to confer with you as to the practicable means for its prompt
                            realization.</p>

                            of duty.”</p>
                        <p>It is also incumbent upon me to state to you, recalling what you said to
                            me in the aforesaid conference, that the President has been wrongly
                            informed by those who have told him that the furnishing of relief to the
                            reconcentrados had been stopped. What has been done, as General Blanco
                            telegraphs to me, has been to cease to issue rations in kind owing to
                            the difficulty of transporting the same by the military administration,
                            but they are given the equivalent in money, as has often been done in
                            the case of the soldiery.</p>
                        <p>In addition to what I have hereinbefore stated, I deem it my duty to
                            remind you that on the 6th instant I had the honor to say to you that
                            the Government of His Majesty had decided, in deference to the desires
                            of the President and even going beyond them, that not only provisions
                            will enter free of duty as suggested, but also the medicines, clothing,
                            and articles of prime necessity that might be sent to the prelate of
                            Havana, who would attend to their distribution; and I ought likewise to
                            add that it has been announced through the press that the Government of
                            His Majesty had authorized me to receive whatever private charity might
                            wish to send to those who are suffering from the consequences of the
                            war, the ports of the island being, moreover, open, so far as the
                            Government of His Majesty is concerned, since the first week of December
                            for all who, being moved by love of their neighbors, might seek to give
                            them succor.</p>

                            for the succor of the sufferers in Cuba. I inclose a copy thereof.</p>

                            <p>By direction of the President, the public is informed that, in
                                deference to the earnest desire of the Government to contribute by
                                effective action toward the relief of the suffering people in the
                                Island of Cuba, arrangements have been perfected by which charitable
                                contributions, in money or in kind, can be sent to the island by the
                                benevolently disposed people of the United States.</p>
                            <p>Money, provisions, clothing, medicines, and the like articles of
                                prime necessity can be forwarded to Gen. Fitzhugh Lee, the
                                consul-general of the United States at Havana, and all articles now
                                dutiable by law so consigned will be admitted into Cuba free of
                                duty. The consul-general has been instructed to receive the same and
                                to cooperate with the local authorities and the charitable boards
                                for the distribution of such relief among the destitute and needy
                                people of Cuba.</p>
                            <p>The President is confident that the people of the United States, who
                                have on many occasions in the past responded most generously to the
                                cry for bread from peoples stricken by famine or sore calamity, and
                                who have beheld no less generous action on the part of foreign
                                communities when their own countrymen have suffered from fire and
                                flood, will heed the appeal for aid that comes from the destitute at
                                their own threshold and, especially at this season of good will and
                                rejoicing, give of their abundance to this humane end.</p>

                            took place between my esteemed predecessor and yourself in February and
                            March of last year concerning the expropriation of property of citizens
                            of the United States for military use in Cuba, in violation of the
                            provisions of article 7 of the treaty of 1795, and you will especially
                            remember the gratifying assurance conveyed by your note of April 1,
                            1896, that General Weyler had issued positive orders to the civil as
                            well as the military authorities of the island, in conformity with the
                            wishes expressed in Mr. Olney’s note of February 14 preceding.</p>
                        <p>The comparative lack of complaint on this score during the past year has
                            been regarded by this Government as a gratifying proof that the just
                            claims of this Government to protect the property rights of its citizens
                            in Cuba under existing treaties were distinctly admitted and positively
                            safeguarded. A circumstance, however, is now reported to me, which, if
                            it does not arise in ignorance of the facts of ownership or in gross
                            misconception of his rights and obligations in the matter on the part of
                            the superior authority of the Island of Cuba, manifests such a complete
                            disregard of the rights of an American citizen as to <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0549"/>call for earnest protest and instant
                            demand, such as the consul-general of the United States at Havana has
                            been instructed by cable to make.</p>
                        <p>I am advised that the sugar estate known as La Confianza, situated in
                            Vieja Bermeja, in the district of Alfonso XII and the province of
                            Matanzas, has been virtually seized by the royal authorities under a
                            proclamation by which the whole of the said estate has been included in
                            one of the “agricultural zones” created by the Governor-General of the
                            island for the declared purpose of relieving the distress of the
                            inhabitants resulting from the enforced concentration of destitute
                            agricultural labor in the garrison towns without resources of their own
                            and without adequate support by the State. The property in question
                            belongs to a citizen of the United States, Mrs. Enriqueta Echarte de
                            Farres, wife of the American citizen Edelberto Farres, residing in New
                            York.</p>
                        <p>I had occasion, in my note of the 26th ultimo, to set forth the views of
                            the President respecting certain inhumane practices in the conduct of
                            the present protracted war in Cuba, and especially with regard to the
                            concentration of the dispossessed laborers of the plantations in the
                            garrison towns, there to be huddled without means of existence and to be
                            exposed to pestilence as well as famine. That the inhumane aspect of
                            this measure may have impressed itself upon the responsible
                            representative of His Majesty’s rule in Cuba, and may have suggested the
                            need of providing occupation and support for the starving crowds his
                            policy has forced into the cities or camped in their purlieus, may be an
                            encouraging sign from which I should regret to withhold any just praise,
                            but I can not ignore, the fact that the appropriation of the estate of
                            an American citizen and its diversion from its hitherto productive uses
                            for its owner’s benefit by conversion into an agricultural colony of
                            impoverished concentrados, however commendable from the Spanish
                            standpoint or from that of abstract humanity, is a flat violation of the
                            treaty rights of that citizen.</p>
                        <p>Your Government has admitted the wrongfulness of the practice of
                            expropriating the property of citizens of the United States, even when
                            the military exigencies of a campaign in the field might be pleaded in
                            excuse for taking supplies and food for which rightful compensation is
                            made. It is obviously a more unlawful proceeding to invade the landed
                            estate of an alien owner and, by virtual confiscation thereof, convert
                            it indefinitely to the public use as an agricultural settlement under
                            conditions which, even if their early termination might be looked for,
                            must destroy the material resources of the property, depriving the owner
                            of even the poor return which might enable the constantly accruing
                            taxation thereon to be met, and working grievous wrong to a citizen of a
                            friendly State.</p>
                        <p>The consul-general of the United States at Havana has been instructed
                            that the right of this Government to protest against the order referred
                            to, and to demand its revocation so far as it shall be found to violate
                            the treaty rights of an American citizen, is beyond question, and he is
                            told, while strongly but temporarily obeying the President’s direction,
                            to leave no doubt in the mind of the responsible Spanish authority of
                            the Island of Cuba as to the earnestness of the demand or as to the
                            confidence here felt that it will be promptly respected as befits the
                            good relations which this Government is desirous in every way to
                            subserve.</p>
                        <p>I should be glad if you would add your representations to mine, in order
                            that this just cause of remonstrance may be dispelled.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In the note which I had the honor to
                            address to you on the 26th ultimo, concerning the conduct of the war in
                            Cuba, I referred to General Weyler’s announced policy of the destruction
                            of resources in all places where his orders are not carried into effect,
                            whereby a vicious chain of recurring injury is set up, plantations and
                            estates are deprived of the capacity to earn returns, while the burden
                            of contribution remains unabated, so that the arrears of taxation keep
                            pace with the withhold-ment of the means of paying taxes, and, to
                            complete the circle, withdrawal of protection from the denuded and
                            bankrupt property becomes the necessary result of the condition which
                            the military policy has devised and carried out.</p>
                        <p>Since that note was written I have received from the consul-general at
                            Havana translation of a communication addressed to General Lee on the
                            22d ultimo, in reference to the sugar estate “Victoria,” in the Sagua
                            district, from which it appears that protection is withdrawn from that
                            impoverished estate because the stoppage of operations thereon during
                            the last two crops has left it without the means to pay the guard
                            necessary to its protection. This communication affords timely
                            confirmation of all that I said in my note of the 26th ultimo in this
                            regard, and I therefore take the liberty of sending you a copy.</p>
                        <p>It is proper in this relation to advert to an additional and special
                            feature of hardship which is imposed in the case of the “Victoria”
                            estate by a constructive decision of the Captain-Generalcy of the
                            island. The requirements of the recent bando in regard to the
                            maintenance of protective guards at the cost of the property are in
                            terms applicable only to such estates as may resume the production of
                            sugar, and to that end may require an additional special guard for the
                            surveillance of their mills and the force of temporarily reconcentrated
                            laborers. The “Victoria” estate has not resumed the production of sugar
                            5 it only appears that certain tenant farmers upon the estate have cut
                            and sold cane to another mill presumably authorized to grind. To apply
                            the bando in question to this “Victoria” estate under the circumstances
                            is obviously unjust. This Government can not admit that the
                            responsibility of Spain for the protection of American property within
                            the sphere of Spanish control is to be measured by any other test than
                            that of actual ability so to protect it. To be able to protect and yet
                            to refuse protection upon a self-formulated pretext can not, in the view
                            of this Government, exempt that of Spain from its just liabilities in
                            the premises should injury to American rights result from the removal of
                            protection. The consul-general will, consequently, be instructed to
                            remonstrate against the withdrawal of military protection from the
                            “Victoria” estate upon the grounds advanced in the letter of the Marquis
                            de Ahumada to General Lee, reserving all rights in the matter.</p>

                            Richard Olney <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0551"/>when lie was at
                            the head of the Department now under your worthy charge, nor my note of
                            April 1, 1896, whereby I gave assurances, to which your excellency
                            refers as gratifying, with respect to the expropriation for military
                            purposes of property belonging to citizens of the United States, and to
                            the enforcement of Article VII of the treaty of 1795.</p>
                        <p>For this reason, as I had received no complaint for more than a year, and
                            as I had no information that any complaint based upon justice, which had
                            not been satisfied, had been presented, I was deeply pained that your
                            excellency, in informing me of the case of the sugar estate “Confianza,”
                            belonging to Dona Enriqueta de Farres, deemed it necessary to make use
                            of the tone which characterizes your note of the 2d. instant, to which I
                            now have the honor to reply.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency appears, in your note, to entertain doubt as to whether
                            there was not ignorance on the part of the authorities of the Island of
                            Cuba as to the fact of the aforesaid estate’s being the property of an
                            American citizen; it is clearly deduced from your note that you are
                            still unaware of the reasons which the authorities of the island had to
                            resort to the measure which occasions the complaint; you do not appear
                            to have any knowledge that the interested party or the nearest consular
                            officer made such remonstrances as would appear to be natural, if any
                            right was disregarded; you add that the United States consul-general has
                            received instructions to present a complaint (demand), and even a
                            protest, which I think can not be pertinent unless in case of the
                            complaint’s receiving no attention, or of a denial of justice; under
                            these circumstances, and until it has been shown by an actual study of
                            the facts and circumstances that there has been a deliberate violation
                            of the treaty, or that just reparation has been denied, I think that a
                            simple appeal to the sentiments of justice and benevolence of His
                            Majesty’s Government toward American citizens (to which sentiments
                            appeal has never been made in vain) would have been more conducive to
                            the object which your excellency has in view. A simple statement of
                            facts and the presentation of evidence that an injustice has been
                            committed, a right violated or an international agreement disregarded,
                            will always have greater force for Spain than protests, peremptory
                            demands, and what there may be of concealed menace in certain
                            phrases.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency refers in your note to what you said in that of the 26th
                            ultimo, a matter which is remotely connected with the case of this
                            complaint. I should devote no attention to this, having done so already,
                            if your excellency did not appear to mean that the agricultural zones
                            are something new, whereas they were established simultaneously with the
                            concentration, or even before the adoption of that measure.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency informs me, in concluding your note, that you will be
                            glad if I will add my influence to yours in order to avoid any just
                            cause of complaint.</p>
                        <p>I will do so, continuing the course which I have pursued for more than
                            two years, and continuing the efforts which I have made during that time
                            to maintain and draw closer, to the best of my ability, the relations
                            between the two Governments, basing them upon justice and mutual
                            respect. Your excellency will understand, however, that I should be
                            wanting in my duty to myself if I could receive manifestations like
                            those which you make to me without telling you, on my own responsibility
                            and before I have been able to communicate with my Government, that I
                            think that it is a shorter and safer way to consider, from the outset,
                            that His Majesty’s Government is inspired by the <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0552"/>loftiest sentiments of justice, and not
                            to think that energy and asperity of phraseology can add anything to the
                            bases of justice or expedite and facilitate solutions.</p>

                            receipt of your two notes of the 30th ultimo and the 3d instant, the
                            first being in acknowledgment of mine of the 26th ultimo, touching
                            certain phases of the policy under which the contest in Cuba is
                            conducted on the part of Spain, and the latter in answer to my
                            representation, on the 2d instant, of the specific application of that
                            policy reported to me in the case of the American-owned estate
                            “Confianza,” near Matanzas, which by proclamation has been expropriated
                            as a colonizing ground for the “reconcentrados in that vicinity.</p>
                        <p>I note your reference to the supposed “tone” of my latter communication.
                            I can only assure you that it was as far from my purpose to give an
                            exceptional tone to my note as it doubtless was from yours in phrasing
                            your reply.</p>
                        <p>My note was intended to be what you state you would prefer in such
                            cases—a simple presentation of facts showing that an injustice is being
                            done to the rights of an American citizen, coupled with a request that
                            you would, as in past instances, second the representations the United
                            States consul-general had been instructed to make in setting forth the
                            injury complained of and asking the suitable remedy. I search that note
                            in vain for the “concealed menace in certain phrases” which you assign
                            to it. None was intended. It was a simple and direct statement of our
                            case.</p>
                        <p>You are quite right in your assumption that I entertained doubt as to
                            whether the authorities of the island may not have been ignorant of the
                            fact of the “Confianza” estate being the property of an American
                            citizen. As they stand, the representations of this Government admit of
                            friendly and satisfactory response on the part of yours, leading to a
                            frank and honorable disposal of the incident, a result which could not
                            fail to be most gratifying to both.</p>
                        <p>Recurring to the more important general matters presented in my note of
                            June 26, it behooves me to express sincere regret and indeed no little
                            concern, that your response should so signally fail to grasp the scope
                            and essence of my remonstrance against the manner in which the war in
                            Cuba is being waged to the injury of the material interests of the
                            island, and of the United States therein, and in disregard of ordinary
                            principles of humanity. I note with the customary reserve your
                            controversion of certain selected details stated in my note, but I find
                            no intimation that the just and eminently considerate remonstrances put
                            forth in the name of the American Government and people will be heeded,
                            or that any change is likely in the systems of repression and
                            devastation to which the Spanish power has resorted in the effort to
                            attain by indirect ends which the legitimate machinery of civilized war
                            appears to be admittedly unable to reach.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to Mr. Sherman’s note to
                            you of the 14th instant in regard to the notification received under
                            date of June 22 by the consul-general at Havana from the Marquis de
                            Ahumada, touching the withdrawal of protection from the sugar estate
                            “Victoria,” I have the honor to state that I am now advised that the
                            troops which had heretofore protected the estate in question were
                            withdrawn by order of the military commander at Sagua on the 9th
                            instant, the administrator of the estate being absent at the time, which
                            latter circumstance will explain the delay in receiving this
                            information.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as the terms of General Weyler’s bando, under which the
                            protection is withdrawn, require that the estate, if left without a
                            garrison, shall be abandoned by all persons residing or being thereon,
                            the effect of this determination of the authorities is not only to
                            deprive the property of citizens of the United States of the protection
                            due to them, but it amounts to the condemnation of this valuable
                            property to abandonment, dilapidation and possible destruction, against
                            which this Government is constrained to remonstrate, not merely in the
                            present case, but in all others where the same state of facts may be
                            ascertained to exist.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to previous correspondence
                            between this Department and your legation in regard to the expropriation
                            of the property of American citizens in the Island of Cuba for military
                            purposes contrary to the provisions of Article VII of the treaty of
                            1795, and especially to my predecessor’s note No. 101, of March 13,
                            1896, I have the honor to state that the consul of the United States at
                            Sagua la Grande has again reported to this Department the case of Mr.
                            John F. Jova, a citizen of the United States, and part owner, with two
                            other American citizens, of the sugar estate known as Natalia, in the
                            vicinity of the town of Calabazas.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Jova, in his sworn statement, says that the estate was completely
                            abandoned by military order about the beginning of the present year;
                            that since that date the property has fallen a prey to Spanish soldiers,
                            principally the local guerrillas of Calabazas; that although he made
                            complaint thereof, the soldiers have in no way been restrained in their
                            acts of spoliation, but have continued to despoil and impress the
                            property on the estate, having about the end of June or beginning of
                            July last carried off everything that was portable which could be used
                            or sold, even removing doors and demolishing the veranda to the
                            residence, a valuable structure of substantial material.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Jova adds, in a later affidavit, that the battalion known as
                            “Zaragoza” has since been temporarily quartered on the estate, not, he
                            alleges, as a guard, but because the place was a convenient point for
                            encampmant from which reconnoitering movements could be made. This will
                            result, he states, in the complete destruction of the property by the
                            insurgents, when the force shall have been withdrawn, although little
                            now remains except the bare buildings.</p>
                        <p>It appears therefore from this complaint that it is not a question of
                            expropriation for organized military operations for which the treaty of
                            1795 provides, but of wanton depredation and pillage of private property
                            by the soldiery, in violation not only of the treaty rights of an
                            American citizen, but of the ordinary rules of war. This seems to call
                            for a searching inquiry on the part of your Government, punishment of
                            the offenders if discovered, stringent orders to prevent the recurrence
                            of such acts of spoliation, and full compensation to the injured
                            party.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 15th of October last my predecessor
                            sent to you a telegraphic instruction concerning the case of Manuel
                            Fernandez Chaqueilo, an American citizen, alleged to have been taken in
                            combat with arms in hand and committed for trial by military
                            jurisdiction; and in that instruction reference was made to the
                            circumstance that Chaqueilo is a material witness in the case of Charles
                            Govin and that his execution would silence important testimony.</p>
                        <p>In the note of the Duke of Tetuan, dated October 21, replying to your
                            representations in the case, the ministry of state professed to have no
                            knowledge of the case of Govin, to which Chaqueilo’s testimony was
                            declared to be important, and denied that the request of this Government
                            in that connection could be based upon any consideration or legal
                            prescription whatever. It is presumed that you have since had ample
                            opportunity to acquaint his excellency with the facts of the murder of
                            Charles Govin and the singularly essential nature of the testimony of
                            Chaqueilo in this regard.</p>
                        <p>By a recent dispatch from the United States consul-general at Havana,
                            under date of July 3, it appears that Chaqueilo alleges that he is a
                            “presentado,” and it is stated that he has been formally acquainted with
                            the charges against him, to wit, “rebellion with the aggravating
                            circumstance of incendiarism.” This latter charge of arson, if indeed it
                            has been made, is entirely new. It is to be significantly noticed that
                            in an official communication of July 4, 1897, to the consul-general, the
                            Marques de Ahumada mentioned only “the cause initiated for rebellion
                            against the citizen of the United States, Manuel Fernandez Chaqueilo,
                            arrested with arms in hand,” being entirely silent as to any added
                            charge of arson. A copy of that note is subjoined for your fuller
                            information.</p>
                        <p>In view of the repeated assertion that Chaqueilo’s testimony is <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0557"/>essential to the substantiation
                            of the claim of this Government against Spain growing out of the murder
                            of Charles Govin, it would be most unfortunate if at this late day, and
                            while that claim is still pending, the testimony of this witness should
                            be silenced by conviction and execution upon a charge not even alluded
                            to in the replies of the Spanish Government to the representations made
                            by us in Chaqueilo’s behalf.</p>
                        <p>The facts so far as they can be learned appear to justify the allegation
                            that Chaqueilo surrendered himself as a prisoner of war. The diligent
                            inquires of the consul-general fail to suggest that the prisoner has
                            been guilty of incendiarism.</p>
                        <p>These facts are brought to attention in the belief that they suggest
                            sufficient doubt as to the proceedings against Chaqueilo to justify this
                            Government in reiterating its already repeated request that in the event
                            of conviction the proceedings shall be referred to Madrid for
                            examination, in order not only that justice may be ascertained to have
                            been done in respect to Chaqueilo himself, but that measures may be
                            taken to prevent the Government of the United States as the plaintiff in
                            action from suffering the injustice of having’ the testimony of an
                            important witness in its behalf summarily silenced by the action of the
                            defendant.</p>

                            the 22d ultimo has not yet been received from Havana. In a telegram of
                            that date General Lee reported that the “fiscal” had demanded the death

                            remonstrances, against any action, speedy or tardy, whereby this
                            Government may be deprived of important testimony necessary for the

                            call the Department’s attention to the fact that the only information I
                            have ever received regarding the murder of Govin has been that contained
                            in the Department’s telegrams and despatches upon the Chaquielo case;
                            and that, consequently, I have never been able to make a formal
                            presentation of that (Govin’s) case to the Spanish Government.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have had the honor to receive
                                your courteous note of yesterday’s date, transmitting a copy of a
                                dispatch addressed to you by the Secretary of State of the United
                                States relative to the proceedings instituted in the Island of Cuba
                                against the naturalized American, Manuel Fernando Chaqueilo, who was
                                taken prisoner with arms in his hand.</p>
                            <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0559"/>
                            <p>The documents in my possession regarding the matter do not show what
                                charges have been made against said individual. It only appears that
                                the consul general of the United States at Havana made that inquiry
                                of the Governor and Captain-General of the Island of Cuba under date
                                of October 8, 1896; and that superior authority answered him, by
                                letter of the 10th of the same month and year, that as the cause was
                                then under instruction, and this being secret, he could not reply to
                                his inquiry; but that, however, as soon as the cause arrived at the
                                plenary stage the prisoner would be informed of the charges made
                                against him.</p>
                            <p>In order to give you more information on the subject I have addressed
                                my colleague, the minister of war, who will cable for the necessary
                                data.</p>
                            <p>As regards the connection which may exist between the prisoner and
                                the supposed murder of the American citizen, Govin, I am compelled
                                to repeat to your excellency that I have no official information
                                whatever of that case, because neither your excellency nor the
                                minister plenipotentiary of His Majesty at Washington, nor the Cuban
                                authorities, have sent me any information or communication of any
                                kind upon the matter. Regarding this point I also request the
                                minister of war to ask the Captain-General of the island for
                                information.</p>
                            <p>As soon as I receive the reports referred to I will take great
                                pleasure in answering more fully to the statements made by your
                                excellency in your said note of yesterday.</p>

                                proposed that a death sentence should be imposed for having belonged
                                to an incendiary band. In view of that, and according to the

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor very respectfully to
                                report to the honorable Department of State that on Monday last I
                                received a communication from his excellency, Francisco Oliveros,
                                military governor of this province, asking for a list of all
                                American property within this zone. I learned that the same request
                                had been made of my agent at Guantanamo, and whether at other
                                agencies or not I have not learned.</p>
                            <p>I also learned that similar requests had not been made to the consuls
                                of other nations.</p>
                            <p>Having no knowledge of why the request was made or for what purpose
                                it is to be used, after getting his excellency to define the
                                boundaries of the zone mentioned, I made the inclosed reply, since
                                which have heard nothing, and therefore take it for granted that the
                                answer is satisfactory to the officers of Her Spanish Majesty’s
                                (Government, or at least is a fair and proper answer to their
                                question.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge
                                the receipt of your second communication of August 2, concerning
                                real estate owned by Americans within this zone.</p>
                            <p>I desire to give your excellency as good a reply as possible, but
                                find the question beset with difficulties that do not appear at
                                first sight, owing to the absence of any property register at the
                                consulate. A very few American citizens have voluntarily made a list
                                of their property, mostly personal, and left it at this consulate;
                                but, so far as I recall; outside of the zone mentioned.</p>
                            <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0562"/>
                            <p>The inclosed list contains the names of all Americans registered at
                                this consulate whose houses have of late been or now are within the
                                zone given by your excellency.</p>
                            <p>An examination of the books of the assessor would show whether any
                                property, if so what, is placed in their names. Several of these
                                parties are now absent from Cuba, and I do not know who has their
                                property in charge. Some others own property here who long since
                                ceased to reside here, and their names do not appear on the
                                register. Still others own property in this city and perhaps
                                elsewhere on the island who, so far as I know, never set foot on
                                Cuban soil. To illustrate: The property occupied by this consulate,
                                now and for the last fifteen years, belongs to an American woman,
                                and neither I nor any other consul before me ever knew it until
                                within the last few weeks, when the death of the former agent made
                                it necessary that a new one should produce a new power of attorney,
                                which revealed the fact that the owner lived in Brooklyn, N. Y., and
                                was never here, and owns other property on the island.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Ramon Villalon is the agent of an old lady living in New York,
                                who owns several houses here, yet has not been here for many years.
                                These cases I learned by mere accident. How many others there may be
                                I have no means of knowing.</p>
                            <p>In the inclosed list I have placed the letter “P” after the names of
                                those that I think own property; others are marked “away” because
                                absent.</p>
                            <p>There are three or four corporations of American citizens who own
                                property within the zone mentioned. First, the Juragua Iron Mining
                                Company, Limited, that owns several thousand acres of land, on which
                                are located extensive and valuable iron mines, several hundred
                                dwellings and other buildings, a railroad extending from the mines
                                to a valuable iron pier in Santiago Bay, a large number of cars,
                                locomotives, repair shops, machinery, tools, waterworks, and all the
                                necessary paraphernalia for running and operating such an extensive
                                plant, including valuable houses, offices, and other property at the
                                terminal point known as La Cruz.</p>
                            <p>The Spanish American Iron Mining Company at Saiguiri owns a property
                                quite similar in scope and character to that of the Juragera
                                company.</p>
                            <p>The Salanilla and Maroto Railroad, although under a Spanish charter,
                                is nevertheless mostly owned by American capitalists. The main
                                offices and shops are located in the city, and some 10 miles of the
                                main track are within the zone mentioned. This company also owns a
                                valuable manganese mine at Ponupo, one of the terminal points of the
                                road, but outside of the limits of the zone.</p>
                            <p>Should the information in this communication prove insufficient, I
                                will most cheerfully in any particular case aid your excellency in
                                any way within my power in arriving at such facts as your excellency
                                may desire.</p>
                            <p>With highest consideration, I am, etc.,</p>

                                request of the military governor of the province of Santiago for a
                                list of American property within the consular district.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hyatt’s reply to the governor illustrates the difficulty in the
                                way of furnishing even a partial list of American owners of realty
                                in the Santiago district in response to the request which it would
                                seem has been addressed to the United States consul alone and not to
                                the consul of any other nation. In the absence of any provision of
                                United States law or treaty requiring the consular registration of
                                American property in Spanish jurisdiction, the furnishing of lists
                                based upon information voluntarily supplied by our citizens to our
                                consuls in Cuba can not be suffered to prejudice in any way the
                                rights of any other American property holders whose names may not so
                                appear. Their rights under treaty and under public law are inherent
                                in their national character and can not be impaired by any arbitrary
                                formality of registration prescribed by local authority. The
                                principle is much the same as in regard to the attempt last year to
                                debar unregistered American citizens from their lawful rights. (See
                                    <ref target="frus1896#pg_680">Foreign Relations, 1896, pp.

                            <p>This Government is disposed to facilitate any reasonable resort to
                                registration as a convenient means of announcing and making patent
                                the rights of our citizens in case of need, but it can not admit
                                that omission of a formality not required by our treaty or our laws
                                can impair the mutual relation of allegiance and protection between
                                the Government of the United States and its citizens in a foreign
                                land.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: I regret to inform you that,
                            owing to the fact that the members of the <hi rend="italic">Dauntless</hi> expedition have been acquitted, and that <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0564"/>that vessel has been released
                            (concerning which decision I refrain from expressing an opinion), a new
                            filibustering expedition is being organized on the southeastern coast of
                            Florida. I have knowledge that a car of the Florida East Coast Railroad,
                            with arms and munitions of war on board, left Jacksonville yesterday
                            morning and passed last night through New Smyrna, going south, and that
                            another car, loaded with rifles and dynamite, left Jacksonville this
                            morning in a regular freight train for the east coast, the intention
                            doubtless being that the goods which it has on board shall be
                            transferred to some vessel. My agents suspect that the vessel which the
                            filibusters will use is the yacht <hi rend="italic">Volusia</hi>, of New
                            Smyrna, which has been chartered to transship the goods for the
                            expedition from the railroad to the vessel which is to carry the
                            expedition.</p>
                        <p>In order to frustrate the criminal intentions of the filibusters, it will
                            be well to exercise great vigilance on the southeastern coast of
                            Florida, since it is very possible that the vessel which is to receive
                            the expedition on board will not come near the shore.</p>

                            insurgents, in manifest violation of the laws.</p>
                        <p>Remembering the orders which the Government of the United States has
                            given, that an officer of its Navy be present in person upon the said

                            legation has learned that the aforesaid officer has not considered
                            himself obliged to go on board, because the arms which were on the <hi rend="italic">Dauntless</hi> have been landed and she is now in

                            of the expedition merely in order to dissemble their criminal purposes,
                            I beg your excellency to be pleased to adopt the steps you may deem most
                            appropriate for frustrating the intentions of our enemies, and, in
                            particular, that you will direct that an officer of the Navy shall go on
                            board the <hi rend="italic">Dauntless</hi> and keep watch upon her,
                            whereby I trust that this vessel will not venture to proceed further in
                            the purposes she is seeking to hide by setting out in ballast and

                            information that a filibustering expedition intends to leave New York on
                            Saturday, the 7th instant, and likewise knows that there exists in the
                            said city of New York a deposit of arms and accouterments to be shipped
                            and to form part of the expedition to which I refer.</p>

                            any vessel of the American Navy at New York, and that consequently there

                            excellency the history of said expedition, which set out from Cleveland,
                            near Punta Gorda (Florida), and landed in Cuba.</p>
                        <p>The arms which were carried from Jacksonville to New York on the steamer

                            the persons arrested on board the schooner <hi rend="italic">Blanche
                                Morgan</hi>, were shipped at New York on board the schooner <hi rend="italic">Donna T. Briggs.</hi></p>
                        <p>The men who sailed from New York on the steamer <hi rend="italic">Tallahassee</hi> the 16th of August, and who later joined others,
                            left Tampa by special train on the 28th, were in that city publicly
                            engaged in military drills, dressed in the uniform of Cuban insurgents.
                            On the 28th they went to Cleveland, where they embarked on the tugs
                            (“remolcadores”) <hi rend="italic">Mary Blue</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A. F. Deney</hi>, both of Punta Gorda, and from there were

                            directing expeditions, went at the head of this one.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Sommers N. Smith</hi> rejoined the <hi rend="italic">Donna T. Briggs</hi>, as proves—which I will show

                            of individuals at the upper point of Key West. It was attempted by the
                            United States authorities to intercept and capture them, and a portion
                            of the crew were captured, but the men were allowed to get off.</p>
                        <p>The latter, among whom were Emilio Nunez, from Cleveland; Capt. John
                            O’Brien, who went on board the <hi rend="italic">Donna T. Briggs;</hi>
                            and the Cuban pilot, Silva, left that very night of the 18th instant for
                            Tampa, in the steamer <hi rend="italic">Mascatti</hi>, without any
                            interference on the part of the local or Federal authorities.</p>
                        <p>Nunez came north and arrived at Philadelphia on the 21st, and went
                            afterwards to New York to give an account of the accomplishment of his
                            mission to the Junta, which from the United States directs and promotes
                            the war in Cuba. O’Brien went to Jacksonville. In regard to the steamer
                                <hi rend="italic">Sommers N. Smith</hi>, it arrived at Pensacola the
                            19th of September and was quarantined. The <hi rend="italic">Donna T.
                                Briggs</hi>, so far as I yet know, has not entered any American
                            port.</p>
                        <p>I need not attempt to impress upon your excellency the gravity of all
                            this. Not only are the so-called neutrality laws a dead letter, since
                            the men engaged in these expeditions have been encamped and drilled at
                            Tampa without dissimulation, and have sailed to the knowedge of everyone
                            how they were going and where they were going, but the sanitary laws so
                            severely enforced elsewhere are suspended in order not to disturb the
                            movements of such notorious transgressors of the law as Nunez, O’Brien,
                            and Silva, without the authorities apparently having arrived at the
                            knowledge of what is known to all.</p>
                        <p>As I am informed, in the baggage that was captured at Key West, there
                            were letters which I hope may be preserved as evidence, to avoid <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0569"/>the escape of the guilty from
                            punishment and to prevent the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Sommers N.
                                Smith</hi> from falsification of the facts in the investigation
                            which I do not doubt the Government of the United States will order.</p>

                        <p>In an informal conversation with one of the officials of the Treasury

                            may be possible to do so, the fullest investigation has been made with
                            the above result. Before, however, releasing the vessel, I desire to
                            inquire whether you have any facts to submit which will warrant the
                            vessel’s further detention and prosecution for violation of the
                            neutrality laws of this country, and to say that the Department will be
                            glad to receive them and see that they are promptly acted upon.</p>

                            receipt of your note of the 26th ultimo, wherein you say with reference
                            to the alleged filibustering schooners <hi rend="italic">Donna T.
                                Briggs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sommers N. Smith</hi>, that the
                            consular officers and lawyers of Spain have been directed to furnish the
                            competent authorities with all the data within their possession and to
                            extend every possible assistance for the prosecution of the violations
                            of the neutrality and other laws of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Referring to Mr. Day’s note of October 22, 1897, I may remark that it was
                            intended to ascertain whether your Government actually possessed and
                            could furnish any information upon which judicial proceedings against
                            the <hi rend="italic">Donna T. Briggs</hi> could be based. The
                            instructions to the Spanish consular officers and lawyers employed by
                            the Spanish Government suggest that the holding of the vessel is
                            expected in order <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0571"/>to give those
                            officers time to gather inculpating evidence not now possessed by them
                            upon which to base the prosecution.</p>
                        <p>In the regular course, probable cause shown, by evidence which would of
                            itself justify the institution of proceedings, should precede detention
                            of the supposed offender. While under the law the President of the
                            United States has the right to detain a vessel until he is satisfied of
                            the character and of the purpose of its destination, yet it is not to be
                            supposed that this permission gives him arbitrary authority to detain
                            such vessel indefinitely, and it was evidence of this character that Mr.
                            Day’s note of the 22d ultimo sought, in order that the machinery of
                            justice might be duly set in motion and the long detention of the vessel
                            on mere allegation and suspicion be justified. If evidence upon which to
                            institute suit be not forthcoming, the question of liability to her
                            owners may naturally arise.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: In reply to your polite note of
                            the 1st instant, I have the honor to inform your excellency that I
                            doubtless did not have the good fortune to explain myself with
                            sufficient clearness in my note of the 26th ultimo relative to the <hi rend="italic">Donna T. Briggs</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Sommers
                                N. Smith.</hi></p>
                        <p>In therein stating that I would instruct the lawyers and consular
                            officers I did not mean that data and evidence were to be hunted up, but
                            that they were in existence, and would be presented whenever the law
                            officers of the United States should think that they were necessary for
                            the better and more speedy administration of justice.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the <hi rend="italic">Donna T. Briggs</hi>, there is
                            evidence before the court at Wilmington, in the case of the <hi rend="italic">Laurada</hi>, which, in my opinion, is sufficient to
                            warrant proceedings against that schooner; and as to the same vessel and
                            the tug <hi rend="italic">Sommers N. Smith</hi>, which jointly effected
                            three landings of men and munitions of war in Cuba, the Department of
                            Justice, and probably also the Treasury Department, have received the
                            information which, in pursuance of my instructions, must have been laid
                            before them by Mr. Calderon Carlisle, counsel of this legation.</p>
                        <p>Trusting that these explanations will be sufficient to elucidate the
                            meaning of my note of October 26, and hoping that the violators of the
                            laws in this case will be held responsible,</p>

                                <p>The attorney for the United States at Norfolk has already been
                                    directed by this Department to correspond with Mr. Carlisle, the
                                    attorney for the Spanish Government, in reference to these
                                    vessels, and also to obtain from other possible sources all
                                    facts concerning the allegations against them and to advise the
                                    collector of the port of Norfolk in regard thereto. And the said
                                    United States attorney has been farther directed that if the
                                    facts and circumstances sufficient are ascertained, judicial
                                    proceedings authorized by law be instituted against these
                                    vessels. Of course the Government will not be warranted in
                                    detaining these vessels, or either one of them, for an
                                    indefinite period upon a mere suspicion. Some tangible evidence
                                    of illegality should be found within a reasonable time after
                                    detention or the vessel should be released.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have had the honor to receive
                            your courteous note No. 322 of yesterday informing me that the district
                            attorney of Wilmington does not deem sufficient the evidence which he

                            against the schooner <hi rend="italic">Silver Heels</hi>, which has
                            applied for clearance for the Barbados Islands with a cargo of
                            lumber.</p>
                        <p>I do not know what evidence has been obtained by the said attorney, but I
                            can assure your excellency that Alfred Thompson, of St. George, Me.,
                            second officer on board the <hi rend="italic">Silver Heels</hi> on her
                            last voyage with an expedition, has publicly declared in Wilmington and
                            is ready, as he says, to testify that the said schooner took on board on
                            the 15th of October last a cargo of coal at Port Liberty; that on the
                            Saturday following, in tow of the tug <hi rend="italic">P. H. Wise</hi>,
                            she went to the pier in the East River, of which your Department already
                            has knowledge, where she shipped the cargo of which this legation has
                            spoken in former communications; that the <hi rend="italic">Silver
                                Heels</hi> was towed by the said <hi rend="italic">P. H. Wise</hi>
                            to the Highlands, where a steamer, the name of which he says he does not
                            know, delivered to her four boats to assist in discharging her cargo and
                            seven Cubans, and that she remained there until the afternoon of that
                            day, to wit, the 17th of October, when the <hi rend="italic">P. H.
                                Wise</hi> returned and took the schooner in tow and continued to tow
                            her until the 19th.</p>
                        <p>Only after that date did the <hi rend="italic">Silver Heels</hi> proceed
                            under sail, doing so during some fifteen days, going to Ascension
                            Island, and a week later the <hi rend="italic">Dauntless</hi> arrived
                            there, having on board Captain O’Brien and three or four of the Cubans
                            who had embarked in New York, giving instructions to the schooner to go
                            to a point outside of Orange Key, 16 miles east-southeast, and to anchor
                            there until she should return.</p>
                        <p>From Ascension Island to the new anchorage took the schooner some five
                            days, and they remained there, at the end of which time the <hi rend="italic">Dauntless</hi> arrived again with the same Captain
                            O’Brien and some 50 Cubans. They transshipped to the <hi rend="italic">Dauntless</hi> the boats and the cargo, which latter the said
                            Thompson declares contained cartridges, and the <hi rend="italic">Dauntless</hi> set out for Cuba, as the captain of the steamer
                            stated to the said Thompson. They likewise stated to him that the <hi rend="italic">Dauntless</hi> had been to Key West and Jacksonville,
                            where she had her bottom cleaned.</p>
                        <p>After this the <hi rend="italic">Silver Heels</hi> undertook her return
                            voyage to New York, but the bad weather obliged her to put in to
                            Wilmington, N. C, with all her cargo of coal less some 8 or 10 tons,
                            which she gave to the <hi rend="italic">Dauntless</hi> at Orange
                            Key.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing statements, which can assuredly be amplified by
                            interrogating Alfred Thompson, appear to me to be more than sufficient
                            for a serious investigation, and for proceeding not only against the <hi rend="italic">Silver Heels</hi> but also against the <hi rend="italic">Dauntless.</hi></p>
                        <p>If your excellency will cause the dates to be compared with the entries
                            of the aforesaid <hi rend="italic">Dauntless</hi> upon voyages which she
                            has not explained, and will be pleased to recall the note from this
                            legation of the 11th of November last in which you were informed that
                            the <hi rend="italic">Dauntless</hi> had just arrived at Jacksonville
                            with Captain O’Brien onboard, you will be convinced of the certainty of
                            my statements, and that the said vessel for more than a year past has
                            not performed a single legitimate service, having been solely employed
                            in carrying arms, munitions, and men to the Cuban insurgents.</p>
                        <p>I now permit myself to very seriously call your excellency’s attention to
                            the fact that at the very time that the <hi rend="italic">Silver
                                Heels</hi> asks a clearance for Barbados the <hi rend="italic">Dauntless</hi> has completed the repairs which are being made upon
                            her, and is preparing for another expedition, which there is reason to
                            believe will be in concert with the schooner already so many times
                            mentioned.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It might well be deemed a dereliction of
                            duty to the Government of the United States, as well as a censurable
                            want of candor to that of Spain, if I were longer to defer official
                            expression as well of the anxiety with which the President regards the
                            existing situation in Cuba as of his earnest desire for the prompt and
                            permanent pacification of that island. Any plan giving reasonable
                            assurance of that result and not inconsistent with the just rights and
                            reasonable demands of all concerned would be earnestly promoted by him
                            by all means which the Constitution and laws of this country place at
                            his disposal.</p>
                        <p>It is now some nine or ten months since the nature and prospects of <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0575"/>the insurrection were first
                            discussed between us. In explanation of its rapid and, up to that time,
                            quite unopposed growth and progress, you called attention to the rainy
                            season which from May or June until November renders regular military
                            operations impracticable. Spain was pouring such numbers of troops into
                            Cuba that your theory and opinion that, when they could be used in an
                            active campaign, the insurrection would be almost instantly suppressed,
                            seemed reasonable and probable. In this particular you believed, and
                            sincerely believed, that the present insurrection would offer a most
                            marked contrast to that which began in 1868, and which, being feebly
                            encountered with comparatively small forces, prolonged its life for
                            upward of ten years.</p>
                        <p>It is impossible to deny that the expectations thus entertained by you in
                            the summer and fall of 1895, and shared not merely by all Spaniards but
                            by most disinterested observers as well, have been completely
                            disappointed. The insurgents seem to-day to command a larger part of the
                            island than ever before. Their men under arms, estimated a year ago at
                            from ten to twenty thousand, are now conceded to be at least two or
                            three times as many. Meanwhile, their discipline has been improved and
                            their supply of modern weapons and equipment has been greatly enlarged,
                            while the mere fact that they have held out to this time has given them
                            confidence in their own eyes and prestige with the world at large. In
                            short, it can hardly be questioned that the insurrection, instead of
                            being quelled, is to-day more formidable than ever, and enters upon the
                            second year of its existence with, decidedly improved prospects of
                            successful results.</p>
                        <p>Whether a condition of things entitling the insurgents to recognition as
                            belligerents has yet been brought about may, for the purposes of the
                            present communication, be regarded as immaterial. If it has not been, it
                            is because they are still without an established and organized civil
                            government, having an ascertained situs, presiding over a defined
                            territory, controlling the armed forces in the field, and not only
                            fulfilling the functions of a regular government within its own
                            frontiers, but capable internationally of exercising those powers and
                            discharging those obligations which necessarily devolve upon every
                            member of the family of nations. It is immaterial for present purposes
                            that such is the present political status of the insurgents, because
                            their defiance of the authority of Spain remains none the less
                            pronounced and successful, and their displacement of that authority
                            throughout a very large portion of the island is none the less obvious
                            and real.</p>
                        <p>When, in 1877, the President of the so-called Cuban Republic was
                            captured, its legislative chamber surprised in the mountains and
                            dispersed, and its presiding officer and other principal functionaries
                            killed, it was asserted in some quarters that the insurrection had
                            received its deathblow and might well be deemed to be extinct. The
                            leading organ of the insurrectionists, however, made this response:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The organization of the liberating army is such that a brigade, a
                                    regiment a battalion, a company, or a party of twenty-five men
                                    can operate independently against the enemy in any department
                                    without requiring any instructions save those of their immediate
                                    military officers, because their purpose is but one, and that is
                                    known by heart as well by the general as the soldier, by the
                                    negro as well as the white man or the Chinese, viz, to make war
                                    on the enemy at all times, in all places, and by all means, with
                                    the gun, the machete, and the firebrand. In order to do this,
                                    which is the duty of every Cuban soldier, the direction of a
                                    government or a legislative chamber is not needed; the order of
                                    a subaltern officer, serving under the general in chief, is
                                    sufficient. Thus it is that the government and chamber have in
                                    reality been a superfluous luxury for the revolution.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The situation thus vividly described in 1877 is reproduced to-day. Even
                            if it be granted that a condition of insurgency prevails and nothing <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0576"/>more, it is on so large a scale
                            and diffused over so extensive a region, and is so favored by the
                            physical features and the climate of the country, that the authority of
                            Spain is subverted and the functions of its Government are in abeyance
                            or practically suspended throughout a great part of the island. Spain
                            still holds the seaports and most, if not all, of the large towns in the
                            interior. Nevertheless, a vast area of the territory of the island is in
                            effect under the control of roving bands of insurgents, which, if driven
                            from one place to day by an exhibition of superior force, abandon it
                            only to return to-morrow when that force has moved on for their
                            dislodgment in other quarters.</p>
                        <p>The consequences of this state of things can not be disguised. Outside of
                            the towns still under Spanish rule, anarchy, lawlessness, and terrorism
                            are rampant. The insurgents realize that the wholesale destruction of
                            crops, factories, and machinery advances their cause in two ways. It
                            cripples the resources of Spain on the one hand. On the other, it drives
                            into their ranks the laborers who are thus thrown out of employment. The
                            result is a systematic war upon the industries of the island and upon
                            all the means by which they are carried on, and whereas the normal
                            annual product of the island is valued at something like eighty or a
                            hundred millions, its value for the present year is estimated by
                            competent authority as not exceeding twenty millions.</p>
                        <p>Bad as is this showing for the present year, it must be even worse for
                            the next year and for every succeeding year during which the rebellion
                            continues to live. Some planters have made their crops this year who
                            will not be allowed to make them again. Some have worked their fields
                            and operated their mills this year in the face of a certain loss who
                            have neither the heart nor the means to do so again under the present
                            even more depressing conditions. Not only is it certain that no fresh
                            money is being invested on the island, but it is no secret that capital
                            is fast withdrawing from it, frightened away by the utter hopelessness
                            of the outlook. Why should it not be? What can a prudent man foresee as
                            the outcome of existing conditions except the complete devastation of
                            the island, the entire annihilation of its industries, I and the
                            absolute impoverishment of such of its inhabitants as are unwise or
                            unfortunate enough not to seasonably escape from it?</p>
                        <p>The last preceding insurrection lasted for ten years and then was not
                            subdued, but only succumbed to the influence of certain promised
                            reforms. Where is found the promise that the present rebellion will have
                            a shorter lease of life, unless the end is sooner reached through the
                            exhaustion of Spain herself? Taught by experience, Spain wisely
                            undertook to make its struggle with the present insurrection short,
                            sharp, and decisive, to stamp it out in its very beginnings by
                            concentrating upon it large and well-organized armies, armies infinitely
                            superior in numbers, in discipline, and in equipment to any the
                            insurgents could oppose to them.</p>
                        <p>Those armies were put under the command of its ablest general, as well as
                            its most renowned statesman—of one whose very name was an assurance to
                            the insurgents both of the skillful generalship with which they would be
                            fought and of the reasonable and liberal temper in which just demands
                            for redress of grievances would be received. Yet the efforts of Campos
                            seem to have utterly failed, and his successor, a man who, rightfully or
                            wrongfully, seems to have intensified all the acerbities of the
                            struggle, is now being reenforced with additional troops. It may well be
                            feared, therefore, that if the present is to be of shorter duration than
                            the last insurrection, it will be because the end is to come sooner or
                            later through the inability of Spain to prolong <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0577"/>the conflict, and through her
                            abandonment of the island to the heterogeneous combination of elements
                            and of races now in arms against her.</p>
                        <p>Such a conclusion of the struggle can not be viewed even by the most
                            devoted friend of Cuba and the most enthusiastic advocate of popular
                            government except with the gravest apprehension. There are! only too
                            strong reasons to fear that, once Spain were withdrawn from the island,
                            the sole bond of union between the different factions of the insurgents
                            would disappear; that a war of races would be precipitated, all the more
                            sanguinary for the discipline and experience acquired during the
                            insurrection, and that, even if there were to be temporary peace, it
                            could only be through the establishment of a white and a black republic,
                            which, even if agreeing at the outset upon a division of the island
                            between them, would be enemies from the start, and would never rest
                            until the one had been completely vanquished and subdued by the
                            other.</p>
                        <p>The situation thus described is of great interest to the people of the
                            United States. They are interested in any struggle anywhere for freer
                            political institutions, but necessarily and in special measure in a
                            struggle that is raging almost in sight of our shores. They are
                            interested, as a civilized and Christian nation, in the speedy
                            termination of a civil strife characterized by exceptional bitterness
                            and exceptional excesses on the part of both combatants. They are
                            interested in the noninterruption of extensive trade relations which
                            have been and should continue to be of great advantage to both
                            countries. They are interested in the prevention of that wholesale
                            destruction of property on the island which, making no discrimination
                            between enemies and neutrals, is utterly destroying American investments
                            that should be of immense value, and is utterly impoverishing great
                            numbers of American citizens.</p>
                        <p>On all these grounds and in all these ways the interest of the United
                            States in the existing situation in Cuba yields in extent only to that
                            of Spain herself, and has led many good and honest persons to insist
                            that intervention to terminate the conflict is the immediate and
                            imperative duty of the United States. It is not proposed now to consider
                            whether existing conditions would justify such intervention at the
                            present time, or how much longer those conditions should be endured
                            before such intervention would be justified. That the United States can
                            not contemplate with complacency another ten years of Cuban
                            insurrection, with all its injurious and distressing incidents, may
                            certainly be taken for granted.</p>
                        <p>The object of the present communication, however, is not to discuss
                            intervention, nor to propose intervention, nor to pave the way for
                            intervention. The purpose is exactly the reverse—to suggest whether a
                            solution of present troubles can not be found which will prevent all
                            thought of intervention by rendering it unnecessary. What the United
                            States desires to do, if the way can be pointed out, is to cooperate
                            with Spain in the immediate pacification of the island on such a plan
                            as, leaving Span her rights of sovereignty, shall yet secure to the
                            people of the island all such rights and powers of local self-government
                            as they can reasonably ask. To that end the United States offers and
                            will use her good offices at such time and in such manner as may be
                            deemed most advisable. Its mediation, it is believed, should not be
                            rejected in any quarter, since none could misconceive or mistrust its
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>Spain could not, because our respect for her sovereignty and our
                            determination to do nothing to impair it have been maintained for many
                            years at great cost and in spite of many temptations. The insurgents
                            could <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0578"/>not, because anything
                            assented to by this Government which did not satisfy the reasonable
                            demands and aspirations of Cuba would arouse the indignation of our
                            whole people. It only remains to suggest that, if anything can be done
                            in the direction indicated, it should be done at once and on the
                            initiative of Spain.</p>
                        <p>The more the contest is prolonged, the more bitter and more
                            irreconcilable is the antagonism created, while there is danger that
                            concessions may be so delayed as to be chargeable to weakness and fear
                            of the issue of the contest, and thus be infinitely less acceptable and
                            persuasive than if made while the result still hangs in the balance, and
                            they could be properly credited in some degree at least to a sense of
                            right and justice. Thus far Spain has faced the insurrection sword in
                            hand, and has made no sign to show that surrender and submission would
                            be followed by anything but a return to the old order of things. Would
                            it not be wise to modify that policy and to accompany the application of
                            military force with an authentic declaration of the organic changes that
                            are meditated in the administration of the island with a view to remove
                            all just grounds of complaint?</p>
                        <p>It is for Spain to consider and determine what those changes would be.
                            But should they be such that the United States could urge their
                            adoption, as substantially removing well-founded grievances, its
                            influence would be exerted for their acceptance, and it can hardly be
                            doubted, would be most potential for the termination of hostilities and
                            the restoration of peace and order to the island. One result of the
                            course of proceeding outlined, if no other, would be sure to follow,
                            namely, that the rebellion would lose largely, if not altogether, the
                            moral countenance and support it now enjoys from the people of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>In closing this communication it is hardly necessary to repeat that it is
                            prompted by the friendliest feelings toward Spain and the Span-people.
                            To attribute to the United States any hostile or hidden purposes would
                            be a grave and most lamentable error. The United States has no designs
                            upon Cuba and no designs against the sovereignty of Spain. Neither is it
                            actuated by any spirit of meddlesomeness nor by any desire to force its
                            will upon another nation. Its geographical proximity and all the
                            considerations above detailed compel it to be interested in the solution
                            of the Cuban problem whether it will or no. Its only anxiety is that
                            that solution should be speedy, and, by being founded on truth and
                            justice, should also be permanent.</p>
                        <p>To aid in that solution it offers the suggestions herein contained. They
                            will be totally misapprehended unless the United States be credited with
                            entertaining no other purpose toward Spain than that of lending its
                            assistance to such termination of a fratricidal contest as will leave
                            her honor and dignity unimpaired at the same time that it promotes and
                            conserves the true interests of all parties concerned.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: As I had the honor to inform
                            your excellency some time ago, I lost no time in communicating to the
                            minister of state <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0579"/>of His
                            Majesty the King of Spain the text of the note that your excellency was
                            pleased to address to me, under date of the 4th of April last, in regard
                            to the events that are taking place in the island of Cuba.</p>
                        <p>In his answer, dated May 22 last, the Duke of Tetuan tells me that the
                            importance of the communication here referred to has led the Government
                            of His Majesty to examine it with the greatest care and to postpone an
                            answer until such time as its own views on the complicated and delicate
                            Cuban question should be officially made public.</p>
                        <p>The minister of state adds that since the extensive and liberal purposes
                            of Spain toward Cuba have been laid before the Cortes by the august lips
                            of His Majesty in the speech from the throne, the previous voluntary
                            decisions of the Spanish Government in the matter may serve, as they are
                            now serving, as the basis of a reply to your excellency’s note.</p>
                        <p>The Government, of His Majesty appreciates to its full value the noble
                            frankness with which that of the United States has informed it of the
                            very definite opinion it has formed in regard to the legal impossibility
                            of granting the recognition of belligerency to the Cuban insurgents.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, those who are now fighting in Cuba against the integrity of the
                            Spanish fatherland possess no qualifications entitling them to the
                            respect, or even to the consideration, of the other countries. They do
                            not, as your excellency expresses it, possess any civil government,
                            established and organized, with a known seat and administration of
                            defined territory, and they have not succeeded in permanently occupying
                            any town, much less any city, large or small.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency declares, in the note to which I am now replying, with
                            great legal acumen and spontaneously, that it is impossible for the
                            Cuban insurgents to perform the functions of a regular government within
                            its own frontiers, and much less to exercise the rights and fulfill the
                            obligations that are incumbent on all the members of the family of
                            nations. Moreover, their systematic campaign of destruction against all
                            the industries on the island, and the means by which they are worked,
                            would, of itself, be sufficient to keep them without the pale of the
                            universally recognized rules of international law.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government has read with no less gratification the explicit
                            and spontaneous declarations to the effect that the Government of the
                            United States seeks no advantage in connection with the Cuban question,
                            its only wish being that the ineluctable and lawful sovereignty of Spain
                            be maintained and even strengthened, through the submission of the
                            rebels, which, as your excellency states in your note, is of paramount
                            necessity to the Spanish Government for the maintenance of its authority
                            and its honor.</p>
                        <p>While expressing the high gratification with which His Majesty’s
                            Government took note of the emphatic statements which your excellency
                            was pleased to make in your note of the 4th of April with regard to the
                            sovereignty of Spain and the determination of the United States not to
                            do anything derogatory to it, and acknowledging with pleasure all the
                            weight they carry, the Duke of Tetuan says that nothing else was to be
                            expected of the lofty sense of right cherished by the Government of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>It is unnecessary, as your excellency remarks, and in view of so correct
                            and so friendly an attitude, to discuss the hypothesis of intervention,
                            as it would be utterly inconsistent with the above views.</p>
                        <p>The Government of His Majesty, the King of Spain, fully concurs in the
                            opinion that your excellency was pleased to express in regard to <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0580"/>the future of the island in the
                            event, which can not and shall not be, of the insurrection terminating
                            in its triumph.</p>
                        <p>There can be no greater accuracy of judgment than that displayed by your
                            excellency, and, as you said with great reason, such a termination of
                            the conflict would be looked upon with the most serious misgivings even
                            by the most enthusiastic advocates of popular government; because, as
                            remarked by your excellency, with the heterogeneous combination of races
                            that exist there the disappearance of Spain would be the disappearance
                            of the only bond of union which can keep them in balance, and an
                            unavoidable struggle among the men of different color, contrary to the
                            spirit of Christian civilization, would supervene.</p>
                        <p>The accuracy of your excellency’s statement is all the more striking, as
                            owing to the conditions of population in the island no part of the
                            natives can be conceded superiority over the others if the assistance of
                            the Spaniards from Europe is not taken into account.</p>
                        <p>The Island of Cuba has been exclusively Spanish since its discovery; the
                            great normal development of its resources, whatever it is, whatever its
                            value, and whatever it represents in the community of mankind, it owes
                            in its entirety to the mother country; and even at this day, among the
                            various groups of people that inhabit it, whatever be the standpoint
                            from which the question be examined, the natives of the peninsula are
                            there absolutely necessary for the peace and advancement of the
                            island.</p>
                        <p>All these reasons fully and clearly demonstrate that it is not possible
                            to think that the Island of Cuba can be benefited except through the
                            agency of Spain, acting under her own impulse, and actuated, as she has
                            long been, by the principles of liberty and justice.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish Government is aware of the fact that far from having justice
                            done it on all sides on these points, there are many persons, obviously
                            deceived by incessant slanders, who honestly believe that a ferocious
                            despotism prevails in our Antilles, instead of one of the most liberal
                            political systems in the world, being enjoyed there now as well as
                            before the outbreak of the insurrection.</p>
                        <p>One need only run over the laws governing the Antilles, laws which ought
                            to be sufficiently known in the United States at this day, to perceive
                            how absolutely groundless such impressions are.</p>
                        <p>A collection of the Cuban newspapers published in recent years would
                            suffice to show that few civilized countries then enjoyed to an equal
                            degree freedom of thought and of the press—the foundation of all
                            liberties.</p>
                        <p>The Government of His Majesty and the people of Spain wish and even long
                            for the speedy pacification of Cuba. In order to secure it, they are
                            ready to exert their best efforts and at the same time to adopt such
                            reforms as may be useful or necessary and compatible, of course, with
                            their inalienable sovereignty, as soon as the submission of the
                            insurgents be an accomplished fact.</p>
                        <p>The minister of state, while directing me to bring to the knowledge of
                            your excellency the foregoing views, instructs me to remark how pleased
                            he was to observe that his opinion on this point also agrees with
                            yours.</p>
                        <p>No one is more fully aware of the serious evils suffered by Spaniards and
                            aliens in consequence of the insurrection than the Government of His
                            Majesty. It realizes the immense injury inflicted on Spain by the
                            putting forth, with the unanimous cooperation and approbation of her
                            people, of such efforts as were never before made in America by any
                            European country, it knows at the same time that the interests of
                            foreign <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0581"/>industry and trade
                            suffer, as well as the Spanish interests, from the insurgent system of
                            devastation; but if the insurrection should triumph, the interests of
                            all would not merely suffer, but would entirely and forever disappear
                            amid the madness of perpetual anarchy.</p>
                        <p>It has already been said that, in order to prevent evils of such
                            magnitude, the cabinet of Madrid does not and will not confine itself
                            exclusively to the employment of armed force.</p>
                        <p>The speech from the throne, read before the national representatives,
                            formally promised motu proprio, not only that all that was previously
                            granted, voted by the Cortes, and sanctioned by His Majesty on the 15th
                            of March, 1895, would be carried into effect as soon as the opportunity
                            offered, but also by fresh authorization of the Cortes, all the new
                            extensions and amendments of the original reforms, to the end that both
                            islands may in the administrative department possess a personnel of a
                            local character, that the intervention of the mother country in their
                            domestic concerns may be dispensed with, with the single reservation
                            that nothing will be done to impair the rights of sovereignty or the
                            powers of the Government to preserve the same.</p>
                        <p>This solemn promise, guaranteed by the august word of His Majesty, will
                            be fulfilled by the Spanish Government with a true liberality of
                            views.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing facts, being better known every day, will make it patent to
                            the fair people of other nations that Spain, far from proposing that her
                            subjects in the West Indies should return to a regime unfit for the
                            times when she enjoys such liberal laws, would never have withheld these
                            same laws from the islands, had it not been for the increasing
                            separatist conspiracies which compelled her to look above all to
                            self-defense.</p>
                        <p>The Government of His Majesty most heartily thanks that of the United
                            States for the kind advice it bestows on Spain; but it wishes to state,
                            and entertains the confidence that your excellency will readily see,
                            that it has been forestalling it for a long time past. It follows,
                            therefore, as a matter of course, that it will comply with it in a
                            practical manner as soon as circumstances make it possible.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency will have seen, nevertheless, how the announcement of
                            this concurrence of views has been received.</p>
                        <p>The insurgents, elated by the strength which they have acquired through
                            the aid of a certain number of citizens of the United States, have
                            contemptuously repelled, by the medium of the Cubans residing in this
                            Republic, any idea that the Government of Washington can intervene in
                            the contest, either with its advice or in any other manner, on the
                            supposition that the declarations of disinterestedness on the part of
                            the Government of the United States are false and that it wishes to get
                            possession of the island one of these days. Hence it is evident that no
                            success would attend such possible mediation, which they repel, even
                            admitting that the mother country would condescend to treat with its
                            rebellious subject as one power with another, thus surely jeopardizing
                            its future authority, detracting from its national dignity, and
                            impairing its independence for which it has at all times shown such
                            great earnestness, as history teaches. In brief, there is no effectual
                            way to pacify Cuba unless it begins with the actual submission of the
                            armed rebels to the mother country.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding this, the Government of the United States could, by the
                            use of proper means, contribute greatly to the pacification of the
                            Island of Cuba.</p>
                        <p>The Government of His Majesty is already very grateful to that of <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0582"/>the United States for its
                            intention to prosecute the unlawful expeditions to Cuba of some of its
                            citizens with more vigor than in the past, after making a judicial
                            investigation as to the adequacy of its laws when honestly enforced.</p>
                        <p>Still, the high moral sense of the Government of Washington will
                            undoubtedly suggest to it other more effectual means of preventing
                            henceforth what is now the case, a struggle which is going on so near
                            its frontiers, and which is proving so injurious to its industry and
                            commerce, a fact justly deplored by your excellency, being prolonged so
                            exclusively by the powerful assistance which the rebellion finds in the
                            territory of this great Republic, against the wishes of all those who
                            love order and law.</p>
                        <p>The constant violation of international law in its territory is
                            especially manifest on the part of Cuban emigrants, who care nothing for
                            the losses suffered in the meanwhile by the citizens of the United
                            States and of Spain through the prolongation of the war.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish Government, on its part, has done much and will do more every
                            day in order to achieve such a desirable end, by endeavoring to correct
                            the mistakes of public opinion in the United States and by exposing the
                            plots and calumnies of its rebellious subjects.</p>
                        <p>It may well happen that the declarations recently made in the most solemn
                            form by the Government of His Majesty concerning its intentions for the
                            future will also contribute in a large measure to gratify the wish that
                            your excellency clearly expressed in your note, namely—that all the
                            people of the United States, convinced that we are in the right, will
                            completely cease to extend unlawful aid to the insurgents.</p>
                        <p>If, with that object in view, further particulars on the Cuban question
                            should be desired, in addition to those it already has, by the
                            Government of the United States, which shows itself so hopeful that the
                            justice of Spam may be recognized by all, the Government of His Majesty
                            will take the greatest pleasure in supplying that information with the
                            utmost accuracy of detail.</p>
                        <p>When the Government of the United States shall once be convinced of our
                            being in the right, and when that honest conviction shall in some manner
                            be made public, but little more will be required in order that all those
                            in Cuba who are not merely striving to accomplish the total ruin of the
                            beautiful country in which they were born, being then hopeless of
                            outside help and powerless by themselves, will lay down their arms.</p>
                        <p>Until that happy state of things has been attained Spain will, in the
                            just defense not only of her rights but also of her duty and honor,
                            continue the efforts for an early victory which she is now exerting
                            regardless of the greatest sacrifices.</p>
                        <p>While having the honor of bringing, by order of the Government of His
                            Majesty, the foregoing declarations to the knowledge of your excellency,
                            I improve this opportunity, etc.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received from Mr. George E.
                            Gifford, United States consul at Basle, a letter complaining that the
                            cantonal authorities of Zurich and Schaffhausen, under the guise of
                            sanitary regulations, had interdicted the importations into those
                            cantons of American pork, and requesting my official services in behalf
                            of the merchants whose business has been affected by these orders. I
                            inclose herewith translations of the two orders made by the above-named
                            cantons and a translation of the memorial filed with me by the merchants
                            whose trade has been so seriously threatened.</p>
                        <p>The Swiss federal law, under which these two orders are professedly made,
                            was designed to prevent the importation and sale of meat treated with
                            borax as preserved or cured meat, but did not prevent its importation or
                            sale as fresh meat. A copy of these laws was transmitted to the
                            Department by Mr. Broadhead in his dispatch No. 67, of date of April 3,
                            1895.</p>
                        <p>These orders indicate a clear and unmistakable purpose of hostile
                            discriminations against American pork, and if the statements contained
                            in the inclosed memorial are found to be true such a purpose will be
                            conclusively demonstrated. If it be true, as stated in the memorial,
                            that borax is universally used in the treatment and preparation of pork
                            in Austria, Germany, Italy, and England and Switzerland, and that the
                            pork thus treated is permitted to be sold without objection upon the
                            part of the Swiss authorities, then it will be clearly manifest that the
                            law was passed in the first instance merely to furnish the pretext for
                            the exclusion of American pork.</p>
                        <p>I have submitted this matter to the Department in order that the
                            Department might, if it should deem it advisable, cause an investigation
                            to be made through the consular service in the countries named as to the

                                    measures taken by the authorities of the Cantons of Zurich and
                                    Schaffhausen against the introduction of American salt meats
                                    which have been subjected to a preliminary
                                treatment.</hi></head>
                            <p>Ever since salted or smoked ham has existed there has been a
                                discussion as to the best method of preparing it, and no agreement
                                has ever been reached as to whether the use of salt and saltpeter
                                alone or a mixture of the preservatives is to be preferred. In
                                former years pork was generally pickled or smoked by the raiser in
                                the country and by him marketed, but later the butchers took
                                possession of the trade in this article, once in very limited
                                demand, but now become a leading and indispensable article of
                                consumption.</p>
                            <p>The primitive method of preserving meat by the use of salt or
                                saltpeter always proved more or less unsatisfactory, and for a long
                                time the attempt to discover a better process was without success.
                                As it was necessary to use saltpeter in connection with salt for the
                                completion of the pickling, the meat acquired in this way an acrid,
                                pungent, disagreeable taste. To find a means of avoiding this
                                unpleasant result was the constant aim of specialists in this branch
                                of business as well as of chemists. In the years from 1870–1880 Dr.
                                Jannasch, of Bernberg, first offered an article especially adapted
                                to the preservation of meat which attracted much attention among
                                German specialists. The essential ingredient of this preparation was
                                borax, and after the authorities had declared its employment
                                permissible its use by butchers, sausage makers, and all who are
                                interested in the salting or preparation of meat, fish, etc.,
                                continually increased. Meantime a number of factories were built for
                                the manufacture of curing salts and other means of preserving meats.
                                The basis of all of them was borax.</p>
                            <p>The employment and effect of borax as a means of curing meat are
                                decidedly different from those of saltpeter. The latter substance
                                forms with the salt a pickle, which completely penetrates the meat,
                                so that the saltpeter remains in the piece after it has been
                                withdrawn from the pickle and smokes. Merchandise treated in this
                                way retains, therefore, no inconsiderable percentage of saltpeter,
                                and, what here is essential, a harsh, unpleasant taste, which
                                impairs its quality and, as we shall show hereafter, renders it
                                unwholesome. With borax and borax preparations it is quite
                                otherwise; the meat, slightly salted, is sprinkled with borax, by
                                which the air is excluded and the meat kept in a state of perfect
                                preservation. The borax lies on the exterior of the piece and can be
                                removed by proper treatment before the merchandise is smoked and
                                offered for consumption, so that only slight traces of it remain.
                                Meat treated with borax has the advantage of being only slightly
                                salted and of having a fresh, agreeable taste. It is clear that the
                                superiority of the treatment with borax, rather than with saltpeter,
                                was everywhere recognized, and to-day butchers and the allied
                                branches of trade universally make use of borax and borax
                                preparations, not only in Germany, Austria, Italy, and America, but
                                also in Switzerland.</p>
                            <p>Meats introduced into Switzerland from Austria (ham, kaiserfleisch,
                                corresstucke, <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0585"/>schopfbraten), Italy (bacon, salami, martadella, etc.), Germany
                                (Westphalia bam, gothaercervelatwurst, other sausage, and bacon),
                                England (Yorkshire ham, etc.), and America (ham, corned meat), are,
                                with few exceptions, treated with borax preparations; and in
                                Switzerland itself the ham and other pork contain more or less
                                borax, according to the season of the year.</p>
                            <p>It is true that the question has come up whether meat having
                                undergone a preliminary treatment is unwholesome, and this question
                                has been discussed by the chemical experts occupied in examining
                                provisions. So far no proof founded on facts has been offered that
                                the health of any human being has been in the least degree impaired
                                by eating meat that has been treated with borax. Prof. Dr. Bischoff,
                                official chemical expert for provisions in Berlin, who is regarded
                                as an authority on this subject, has repeatedly declared, as the
                                result of many years’ experience, that the meat treated with borax
                                is absolutely wholesome. The same opinion has been expressed by the
                                Liverpool board of health, the English naval office, the sanitary
                                authorities of Brussels, and many other states and cities. The best
                                proof, however, that the process in question is not harmful lies in
                                the fact that during the twenty-four years since borax has been
                                employed and the fifteen years since its use has been universal no
                                man’s life or health has suffered injury or peril in
                                consequence.</p>
                            <p>The like favorable judgment can not be formed in regard to the
                                treatment of meat with saltpeter. Not only does the pork receive the
                                acrid, unpleasant taste already mentioned, but it loses a part of
                                its value as nourishment, it having been shown that the frequent use
                                of salt meat works injury by disturbing the digestion.</p>
                            <p>Under these circumstances it is astonishing to find that the
                                authorities of two Swiss Cantons—Zurich and Schaffhausen—have
                                absolutely forbidden the sale of meat preserved by borax. The
                                proscriptions of the Zurich authorities contain no indications of
                                the grounds of the exclusion, but suggest that it is the American
                                meats that are aimed at. The board of health of Schaffhausen
                                expresses itself more clearly, and says: “The sale of meat, picnic
                                ham, corned meat, principally of American origin, is forbidden
                                because they are injurious to the health”</p>
                            <p>We see from the decrees of both Cantons that the measures of
                                exclusion are directed against meat of American origin. Both say
                                that the employment of salt and saltpeter for the curing of meat is
                                authorized. It would be difficult for the Schaffhausen board of
                                health to bring the shadow of a proof for its declaration that meats
                                treated with borax are directly injurious to the health. So long as
                                no facts are cited as proof, we must reject this assertion as
                                utterly devoid of foundation. Still more singular is the regulation
                                appearing in both decrees that only table salt and saltpeter shall
                                be employed. We should like to ask both the authorities in question,
                                especially those of Schaffhausen, if they really believe that
                                saltpeter is a harmless means of preserving food. It is difficult to
                                believe that the answer would be in the affirmative.</p>
                            <p>For persons engaged in the trade the affair presents itself in this
                                way: The producers of salt meats are to be forced to prepare their
                                merchandise with saltpeter, according to a method long since
                                rejected, and thus obtain a product of inferior quality which can be
                                sold with difficulty at reduced prices. A further disadvantage
                                connected with the process prescribed by the officials mentioned is
                                that in the opinion of the best chemical experts the saltpeter to be
                                used is directly injurious to the health. So it could easily happen
                                that while Zurich forbids borax and prescribes saltpeter, Berne
                                might forbid saltpeter and prescribe borax. The regulations issued
                                by the two Cantons would, under existing circumstances, be
                                completely unintelligible were it not that a simple solution to the
                                riddle is afforded by their common reference to “meats principally
                                from America.” At any rate, American producers are forced to observe
                                the regulations and prepare their meat in such a way as to obtain an
                                inferior product of difficult sale and drenched with saltpeter; then
                                will be obtained what, after all, is no doubt the chief purpose in
                                view—an insurmountable obstacle to the importation of American
                                meat.</p>
                            <p>But the principal point in the whole matter is this: The
                                proscriptions and prohibitions of Cantonal or Federal Government
                                neither ought to nor can be other than of a general nature; that is
                                to say, we may not make regulations in regard to the products of a
                                country with which we are on friendly terms that do not apply to the
                                producers of other countries also. Yet this is here the case, for
                                while meats treated with borax are introduced from Italy, Austria,
                                Germany, and other countries with practically no limitation, like
                                American products are forbidden; nay, we learn on the best authority
                                that the officials charged with the inspection of meats expressly
                                refuse to extend their researches for borax to the products of the
                                countries mentioned. It is further to be considered that the
                                domestic products are subject to no control as to the use of
                                borax.</p>
                            <p>We are not called upon here to discuss the legal aspect of the
                                question. We are convinced that the American Government and its
                                officials, as in former instances, will take energetic measures to
                                secure for American products in Switzerland the same treatment as
                                that accorded to those of other countries.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose herewith for
                            the information of the Department a translated copy of the
                            correspondence between Messrs. Jenny &amp; Kiebiger and the Swiss
                            Government in reference to the exclusion of American meats by the
                            Cantons of Zurich and Schaffhausen, the subject of my dispatch No. 51.
                            This correspondence was sent to me by Mr. Gifferd, the United States
                            consul at Basle.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed from the reply of the Swiss Government that two
                            inspections are provided for in reference to the importation of foreign
                            meats, one made at the frontier by the Federal authorities, and the
                            other made by the authorities of the Canton in which the meat is offered
                            for sale, and that in the latter case the Swiss Government has no
                            supervision or control. It would seem, therefore, that each Canton may
                            enforce this law in such manner as it may deem proper, giving to it such
                            construction as may best serve its views, and from its judgment there is
                            no appeal.</p>
                        <p>It will be further observed that Messrs. Jenny &amp; Kiebiger, in their
                            communication to the Swiss Government, expressly charge that the
                            Cantonal authorities of Zurich and Schaffhausen habitually admit other
                            foreign meats treated with borax and refuse to subject them to
                            inspection, and that these orders are directed exclusively against
                            American meats. And yet, notwithstanding these direct charges, no
                            investigation is ordered by the Swiss Government, and no relief is
                            given.</p>
                        <p>This correspondence has confirmed me in the opinion expressed in my
                            dispatch No. 51, and has convinced me that the suggestions therein
                            contained offer the speediest method of securing relief from this
                            alleged discrimination.</p>
                        <p>I beg to suggest to the Department that, in my opinion, this present case
                            is but another one of the many where the Swiss cantonal and Federal
                            jurisdictions clash and where the Federal Government may seek to avoid
                            redress or relief on the ground of incompetency to interfere, and,
                            though this alleged discrimination seems to me to be in direct violation
                            of articles 8, 10, and 12 of the treaty of 1855, between the United
                            States and Switzerland, I am doubtful if adequate redress or substantial
                            relief can be obtained unless the case were so completely presented that
                            the facts would clearly show an intent upon the part of the cantonal
                            authorities to discriminate against American meat. If convinced that the
                            objectionable orders were a violation of the terms of the treaty above
                            referred to, the Swiss Government would probably cause them to be
                            revoked.</p>
                        <p>I inclose by separate mail for the use of the Department the rules for
                            the enforcement of the Federal laws adopted October 14, 1887, printed in
                            the French language, to which reference is made in the inclosed
                            correspondence.</p>

                            <p>When, in the year 1895, the question of the admission for sale and
                                consumption of meats treated with borax or borax preparations came
                                    <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0587"/>up, the sanitary
                                authorities of the different Swiss cantons arrived at conclusions
                                not at all in harmony with each other; for, while the impression
                                prevailed in most places that meats so prepared were absolutely
                                innocuous, other health officers came to the contrary conclusion and
                                held that such meats should not be offered for sale.</p>
                            <p>Hereupon the Swiss department of agriculture felt called upon, after
                                a preliminary investigation, to communicate its views to the
                                cantonal authorities. In its messages of February 18 and 23, 1895,
                                it divided the meats coming under consideration into two distinct
                                classes. (1) Meats, neither smoked nor, according to the notions
                                that prevail in this country, salted, which have been treated with
                                borax. Such meats must be regarded, in conformity with articles 100
                                and 101 of the Federal executive order of December, 1893, as fresh,
                                and excluded from importation as well as from sale. (2) Meats,
                                however, which may show traces of borax, but, at the same time,
                                exhibit indications of smoking or salting, may be imported when they
                                conform to the prescriptions of sections 4 and 6 of the articles
                                above cited.</p>
                            <p>So far as our firm is concerned we beg to remark that we have never
                                dealt in meats of the kind mentioned in (1), though we very well
                                know that others have introduced considerable quantities of the
                                same. More than twenty years of business experience has taught us
                                that the offer of such merchandise is inadmissible. From our special
                                standpoint it is even a matter of congratulation that its
                                importation and subsequent marketing is forbidden. We know, however,
                                that others have observed this rule only in part or have wholly
                                ignored it. On the other hand, we have taken the greatest pains to
                                conform to the regulations touching meats of the second class.</p>
                            <p>The sixth section of the Federal order of December 1, 1893,
                                prescribed literally: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>Salted and smoked hams, i. e., meats that through adequate
                                        dessication give perfect confidence that they will keep, and
                                        moreover possess the persistent characteristic color, odor,
                                        and firmness of salted or dried meat, may be admitted to
                                        entry.</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>We have not only given our furnishers strict orders to salt the
                                merchandise sufficiently in accordance with the directions of your
                                Department, which we have sent them, but we have bestowed our
                                conscientious attention on a natural, gradual smoking of the meat,
                                so that we have never offered the consumer a single piece that did
                                not completely answer to requirements of section 6. Without
                                hesitation we can invoke the testimony of every Swiss inspector of
                                provisions and demand whether he has ever found anything to censure
                                in our wares, or anything not in accordance with the above-mentioned
                                prescriptions.</p>
                            <p>We take the liberty to add that it is by no means to be assumed that
                                our merchandise is, so to speak, pickled with borax. For that
                                purpose salt is now employed just as it always has been. Borax is
                                employed only as a packing for the already corned meat, to preserve
                                it during transportation. On arrival of the merchandise the borax is
                                carefully removed from the outside of the meat, which is thereupon
                                smoked. Our process of curing is such that the flesh when smoked and
                                offered for sale retains only insignificant traces of borax.</p>
                            <p>We now believe that, having so carefully and conscientiously observed
                                all the requirements of the agricultural department, we could carry
                                on our long-established business in peace and security; but
                                unfortunately this has not been the case. Quite recently the
                                sanitary authorities of the cantons of Zurich and Schaffhausen have
                                abruptly forbidden the introduction of and sale of meats that have
                                undergone a preliminary treatment with borax. We inclose copies of
                                the orders in question.</p>
                            <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0588"/>
                            <p>We believe ourselves justified in laying before you our protest
                                against these prohibitory measures and at the same time in giving
                                notice of our claim to indemnity for the considerable loss thus
                                occasioned us. As we have observed all legal requirements on
                                importation of the merchandise, paid the duties, and offered it for
                                sale in such a condition as to conform entirely to the prescriptions
                                of the agricultural department, issued on the 13th and 23d of
                                February, 1895, we believe we have acquired the right to sell our
                                meats. That the prohibited import and the reasons given for it are
                                in complete contradiction with your department’s orders and
                                regulations needs no further proof, and is self-evident from the
                                foregoing explanations. But even were it to be conceded that the
                                health officers of Schaffhausen and Zurich are justified in their
                                action—and this we deny in the most decided manner—the prohibition
                                must in that case apply to all meats imported and offered for sale,
                                and not especially, or as actually occurs, exclusively to meats
                                imported from America.</p>
                            <p>From Italy, Germany, and Austria shipments of salted meat, ham,
                                sausage, etc., which, with few exceptions, have been treated with
                                borax (and all are sold without objection), and in Zurich the
                                authorities charged with the execution of the prohibitory measures
                                formally refuse to subject them to an examination. Swiss meats are
                                treated, according to the time of the year, with borax, more or
                                less, known here as “conservemittel” or “conservesalz,” consisting
                                almost wholly of borax. Of this fact we possess ample proofs, as
                                well with reference to domestic products as to those of Italian,
                                German, and Austrian origin.</p>
                            <p>If, then, the treatment with borax is to be forbidden, it is not
                                permissible to enforce the prohibition exclusively against the
                                United States. It is not for us to determine whether meats prepared
                                with borax are injurious to the health or not; we would simply point
                                out that, up to the present time, no case is known where it has been
                                proved that such food has been harmful, although borax has
                                everywhere been employed in this way for more than ten years. It is
                                to be added that after our treatment above described only a trifling
                                quantity of borax is retained in the meat. But the question arises
                                whether the saltpeter prescribed by Zurich and Schaffhausen for
                                preserving meats can be regarded as harmless. We doubt it. From the
                                specialist’s point of view we must declare, as the result of our
                                long experience, that— <list>

                            <p>It is unnecessary for us to draw the obvious conclusion from the
                                above premises. While respectfully requesting your Department to
                                take steps that will lead to the speediest possible removal of the
                                obstacles placed in our way by the cantons of Zurich and
                                Schaffhausen, we beg to state further: Thus far we have conducted
                                our business in conformity with the laws relating to it and have
                                strictly observed all the regulations laid down by the Federal
                                authorities. We have, therefore, besides our considerable stock of
                                the merchandise in question, made large purchases of the same for
                                future delivery, which we in turn have sold to our customers in the
                                same way. The law does not allow us to annul <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0589"/>these business engagements, and we
                                can only look forward to a series of disastrous suits at law, while
                                at the same time we do not know what disposition to make of the
                                merchandise should the prohibition be maintained. Freight and import
                                duties have been paid, and since the meats have been cut and
                                prepared for the Swiss market their shipment to a foreign market is
                                impossible.</p>
                            <p>Commending our application to the benevolent consideration of your
                                Department, we remain, etc.</p>

                            <p>In yours of the 16th instant you complain of the action of the
                                competent authorities of the cantons of Schaffhausen and Zurich in
                                forbidding traffic in meats preserved by the use of borax. Invoking
                                the provisions of article 100 of the Federal executive order in
                                regard to the cattle plague police of October 14, 1887, you request
                                us to effect the repeal of the prohibitory measures.</p>
                            <p>We have the honor to reply that article 100, which you cite, has
                                exclusive reference, so far as its execution belongs to the
                                Confederation, to the action of the frontier veterinary surgeons
                                touching meats introduced from abroad when, from the standpoint of
                                the cattle plague police, such action seems necessary. In the
                                present case the competence of the Federal authorities is limited to
                                the oversight of the certificates of origin prescribed by section 6
                                of article 100, while, according to section 9 the sanitary
                                inspection is committed exclusively to the cantons, whose right and
                                duty it is made to superintend the introduction of all meats and to
                                require a renewed inspection of the same if the occasion requires
                                it. Also, according to the tenor of article 80 of the order in
                                question, the traffic in meats, etc. (meat inspection), in the
                                interior of Switzerland lies exclusively in the jurisdiction of
                                cantonal authorities. We can not, therefore, take any action against
                                the measures adopted by the cantons of Zurich and Schaffhausen and
                                opposed by you.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your dispatch No. 51, of
                            November 25 last, relative to the discrimination alleged to be made by
                            the Cantons of Zurich and Schaffnausen against American meat upon the
                            ground that borax is used in curing the same, I have to inform you that,
                            in accordance with the suggestion contained in your dispatch, the
                            Department, on the 11th of December, 1896, issued a circular instruction
                            to the consular officers of the United States in Austria, Germany, Great
                            Britain, Italy, and Switzerland, directing them to inform the
                            Department, as promptly as <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0590"/>possible, whether in their respective districts borax is used in the
                            curing of pork, and if so whether any of the pork thus cured is exported
                            to Switzerland.</p>
                        <p>I transmit herewith, as indicated below, copies of the reports<note n="1" xml:id="d585fn1">Not printed.</note> on the subject which have been
                            received from our consular officers in the countries above named. It
                            seems from the tenor of these reports that, while there is considerable
                            diversity of practice in different places in the use of borax in curing
                            pork, there is no question but that the use of that article is forbidden
                            in most, if not all, the Cantons of Switzerland. The information thus
                            far obtained does not appear to clearly establish the claim that there
                            is discrimination in Switzerland against the importation of American
                            pork upon the ground that borax is used in curing the same.</p>
                        <p>The Department will await a further report from your legation on the
                            subject before taking any action in reference thereto. Respectfully,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Department’s dispatch No. 90, of the 17th ultimo,
                            relative to the exclusion of American meats cured with borax by certain
                            cantons of Switzerland and inclosing for my information copies of
                            reports from United States consular officers in Austria, Germany, Great
                            Britain, and Switzerland.</p>
                        <p>From these reports it would seem that Switzerland has adopted the same
                            regulations in regard to the importation of meats from other countries
                            and that the orders were not issued for the purpose of discrimination
                            against American meats, as alleged by Messrs. Jenny &amp; Kieberger,
                            reported in my dispatches to the Department No. 51 and No. 55, of dates
                            November 25 and December 12, 1896, respectively.</p>
                        <p>The cantons have, undoubtedly, the right to adopt such sanitary
                            regulations as they may deem proper in reference to the importation and
                            sales of meats and, in the absence of any proof that a discrimination
                            was made against American meats in the enforcement of these regulations,
                            it would not be possible to appeal to the Swiss Federal Council for its
                            interposition upon the ground that these orders were a violation of our
                            rights under the treaty. In the absence of such ‘a claim upon our part,
                            supported by convincing proof, I am convinced that any appeal for the
                            revocation of the objectionable orders and the admission of the
                            interdicted meats would be met with a refusal on the ground that the
                            Swiss Federal Government has no authority to interfere in matters of
                            cantonal regulations.</p>
                        <p>However regretable, the conclusion, therefore, seems to be inevitable
                            that American exporters of meats must either relinquish their profitable
                            trade in Switzerland or abandon their present method of curing their
                            meats with borax.</p>

                            a Swiss Government for the better security and protection those rights,

                            disposition in relation thereto. I was courteously received by both
                            gentlemen and both seemed to recognize the great desirability of such a
                            convention, but neither expressed an opinion as to the competency of the
                            Federal Council to negotiate in relation thereto. They both promised,
                            however, to submit the subject to the judgment of the Federal Council
                            and to report their conclusion thereon in a few days.</p>
                        <p>About one month subsequently, on December 8, 1896, I called on the
                            President of the Confederation again, at his invitation, and he
                            expressed regret that he had not had time to investigate the subject of
                            a naturalization convention with the United States as thoroughly as its
                            merits required, and requested me to address him a note embodying the
                            request which I had submitted to him and Colonel Frey, answering, me
                            that the Federal Council would then give the subject their immediate
                            attention. In compliance with this request I did, immediately upon
                            returning to the legation, address a communication to the President of
                            the Swiss Confederation, dated December 8, 1896, a copy of which I
                            inclose herewith. On January 28, I received a reply thereto in the
                            French language, dated January 22, a copy and translation of which are
                            inclosed herewith.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that the Swiss Government declines to consider a
                            naturalization convention now, as in 1885, on the ground that such a
                            convention would be opposed to article 44 of the Swiss constitution.
                            This article as it appears in the constitution of 1848 reads as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 44. No canton shall expel from its
                                    territory one of its own citizens or deprive him of his rights,
                                    whether acquired by birth or settlement. (Origine on cite.)</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0592"/>
                        <p>This was amended in 1874 by the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Federal legislation shall fix the conditions upon which
                                    foreigners may he naturalized as well as those upon which a
                                    Swiss may give up his citizenship in order to obtain
                                    naturalization in a foreign country.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The Federal Assembly in 1876, in accordance with this amendment,
                            prescribed the process whereby one might lose or gain the right of Swiss
                            citizenship. This law provides, among other things, that a Swiss
                            citizen, in order to renounce his citizenship, must no longer have a
                            domicile in Switzerland; that he must enjoy a civil capacity under the
                            laws of the country in which he resides and must have a citizenship in
                            some foreign country already acquired or assured, for himself, his wife,
                            and his minor children. The declaration of renunciation should be in
                            writing, accompanied by proper proof and presented to the cantonal
                            government. The right of contest is limited to four weeks, and in case
                            of contests the Federal Tribunal decides.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that the amendment to article 44 gives to Federal
                            legislation the right to prescribe the conditions whereby one might lose
                            his citizenship, and, therefore, it would seem to follow logically that
                            such a prescription as the one sought to be embodied in the proposed
                            treaty (that a Swiss acquiring American citizenship should be held to
                            relinquish his Swiss citizenship) might properly fall within the
                            authority of that body. But, as a matter of fact, whatever the words of
                            the amendment may clearly mean, they have been so often and so forcibly
                            interpreted so as to exclude from the Federal Council or Federal
                            Assembly this power that those bodies do not dare, nor do they consider
                            that they have the right, to oppose themselves to this idea. Thus it is
                            that the declination of the Federal Council to enter into negotiations
                            for a naturalization treaty with the United States must be attributed to
                            a real lack of capacity and not to any wish on their part to oppose
                            it.</p>
                        <p>As presenting the Swiss point of view on this subject, I send herewith
                            inclosed to the Department, a translation of an interesting and
                            instructive exact from the Handbuch des schweizerischen
                            Bundes-staatrechts, by Dr. J. J. Blumer, a work of noted authority. In
                            this article the author has presented from the Swiss standpoint, a clear
                            and succinct view of the doctrine of perpetual allegiance and a history
                            of the interesting discussions to which it has given rise.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that, however illogical and indefensible the doctrine
                            may be, it is most profoundly embedded in the sentiment of the Swiss
                            people. Citizenship is regarded by them not only as a sacred possession
                            but also as a valuable property right, entitling the citizen to demand
                            of his commune or canton aid and assistance in case of poverty, or even
                            a home and support in the event of old age and helplessness. It is,
                            perhaps, this aspect of the case which appeals most strongly to Swiss
                            patriotism and is responsible for the manifest repugnance of the Swiss
                            citizen to renounce his citizenship, even after acquiring citizenship in
                            another country. He reserves his Swiss citizenship, as a valuable
                            contingency for old age and helplessness, in the event he should not
                            prosper in his adopted country. The doctrine is thoroughly understood
                            and appreciated by all the people of Switzerland, even among the most
                            ignorant peasants, and is taught in all their schools. Those who
                            emigrate to the United States are not ignorant of its nature but are
                            unwilling to renounce their Swiss citizenship and, hence, when on their
                            return to Switzerland, they are required to perform the duties of
                            citizenship they are not entitled to much sympathy, however desirous the
                            Government of the United States may be to shield them.</p>
                        <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0593"/>
                        <p>They have voluntarily placed themselves in the attitude of owing
                            allegiance to two different sovereignties, and the burdens and
                            inconveniences resulting therefrom would seem to be as essentially a
                            part of this dual allegiance as the advantages which they hope to derive
                            from it. As naturalized citizens of the United States they owe
                            allegiance to our Government and are entitled to its protection as
                            native citizens of Switzerland they hold and claim the right to return
                            to their commune and demand its aid and assistance in case of poverty or
                            helplessness. As long as they remain in their Swiss jurisdiction
                            Switzerland claims the right to exact of them military service and other
                            duties of citizenship as an equivalent for the possible benefit they may
                            receive from their commune in the event of decrepitude and
                            helplessness.</p>
                        <p>For harmonizing views so widely and radically different and so
                            conflicting as those entertained by the two Governments upon this
                            important subject, a naturalization convention would seem to be the
                            wisest and best remedy, but I regret to say that I see nothing in the
                            present attitude of the Swiss Federal Council or in the sentiment of the
                            people to justify the hope of such consummation in the near future.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to invite your
                                excellency’s attention to the subject of a naturalization convention
                                between the United States and Switzerland. This subject has engaged
                                the attention of the two Governments as far back as in 1884, at
                                which time the Government of the United States urged the project of
                                such a treaty upon the Swiss Government. On the 20th of February,
                                1885, the Swiss Government, in response to this proposed treaty,
                                replied that Swiss nationality depends upon citizenship of or in a
                                Canton; that article 44 of the Swiss constitution forbids the
                                Cantons to deprive a citizen of his citizenship, and the
                                confederation also has no authority to do so, and that,
                                consequently, the confederation lacks the competence by treaty to
                                connect with the acquisition of citizenship in the United States the
                                loss of citizenship in Switzerland. In view of this constitutional
                                objection upon the part of Switzerland, the subject was no further
                                pressed at that time.</p>
                            <p>In May, 1888, the committee of the National Council in its report
                                upon the acts of the Federal Council made reference to the repeated
                                suggestions of the United States for a naturalization treaty, set
                                out the objections theretofore made by the Federal Council, and
                                added that the Federal Council had latterly felt well disposed to
                                the project of such a treaty, and concluded with a recommendation
                                that the Council enter into a consideration of the convention
                                proposed.</p>
                            <p>It is the purpose of this note to inquire of your excellency whether
                                the Federal Council now has the competency to negotiate a
                                naturalization convention with the United States, as suggested in
                                the foregoing report, and whether the Swiss Government at present
                                feels disposed to enter into consideration of such a convention.</p>
                            <p>I take this occasion, etc.,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In answer to the note of your
                                excellency of December 8 last, submitting to us the project of a
                                treaty between Switzerland and the United States on the subject of
                                naturalization, we have the honor to inform you that to the
                                conclusion of such a treaty as outlined in the above-mentioned
                                project there is opposed to-day, as in 1885, the principle
                                enunciated in Article 44 of the Federal Constitution.</p>
                            <p>If the Government of the United States of America finds it strange
                                (Report of the Secretary of State to the President for the year
                                1896, p., 28) that Switzerland clings to this principle, it is
                                prayed to remember that it is for each state to regulate for itself
                                the conditions under which one acquires or loses the right of
                                citizenship within it’s boundaries, and that the practice followed
                                in Switzerland has its foundation in the point of view and sentiment
                                of the Swiss people, just as the principles of law in force in the
                                United States, and differing from ours, spring, no doubt, from the
                                particular character of the American people.</p>
                            <p>Besides, it is not exact that a Swiss citizen can renounce his Swiss
                                citizenship only with the consent of his commune. If the right of
                                renunciation of Swiss citizenship is contested, the applicant,
                                following the Federal law of July 3, 1896, can have recourse to the
                                Federal tribunal which, if the conditions mentioned in this law are
                                complied with, decides what is necessary to enforce his demand.
                                Thus, even lately, the Federal tribunal has held that the fact of
                                not having paid the military tax is not a valid reason for
                                withholding the right to renounce citizenship.</p>

                                    Schweizerischen-Bundesstaatrechts, by Dr. J. J. Blumer, vol. 1,
                                    page 880.</hi></head>
                            <p>The possession of the right of Swiss citizenship is derived from the
                                right of citizenship cantonal, as this in turn is subordinated to
                                the possession of the right of citizenship communal, or of a
                                commune.</p>
                            <p>It is, therefore, to the Cantons that belongs the privilege of
                                promulgating the regulations upon the loss or acquisition of
                                citizenship, but inasmuch as contests between the Cantons and even
                                international conflicts may arise from this state of things, the
                                constituted authorities believed, as early as in 1848, that it was
                                necessary to insert in the constitution this principle: “That no
                                Canton can deprive any of its citizens of the right of origin or of
                                citizenship.” It was sought to avoid thus a return to the system of
                                “heimat losat’or “homeless people,” resulting formerly from the fact
                                that certain Cantons had withdrawn the right of citizenship or
                                commune from their citizens who embraced another religion or
                                contracted marriage with the professor of another faith, whereas
                                other Cantons had sought to prevent this by a vote of the assembly
                                of Cantons.</p>
                            <p>At the diet in 1848 the deputation from Zurich proposed to make an
                                exception to the principle above stated in the case where a Swiss
                                should possess uncontested citizenship rights in a foreign country.
                                It was urged that if one continued to consider forever and in all
                                circumstances the emigrants as citizens, the Cantons and communes
                                would have in time a population outside of its boundaries, without
                                direct connection with their country, and who would not avail
                                themselves of the right of citizenship except upon such occasions as
                                it should be to their advantage. It was objected to the proposition
                                of Zurich that the right of Swiss citizenship should be held so <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0595"/>sacred that any
                                proscription of it was absolutely inadmissible; that this notion of
                                the value and importance of the right of Swiss citizenship was bound
                                up and linked with the sentiments of the Swiss people; that a
                                citizen of the confederation should not be allowed to lose his right
                                of citizenship except upon his voluntary renunciation and proof that
                                he had acquired another domicile. Following this discussion the
                                proposition of Zurich was rejected by only two votes majority.</p>
                            <p>During the discussion upon the revision of the constitution in 1871
                                and 1873, it was sought to add to article 42 of the ancient
                                constitution a prohibition against the banishment of citizens of
                                other Cantons from the territory of the Canton where they were. At
                                the same time the National Commission proposed the following
                                amendment: “He who acquires or accepts the citizenship of a foreign
                                country loses his citizenship Swiss and cantonal.” This amendment
                                was supported by arguments analogous to those which were urged in
                                1848 in favor of the proposition of Zurich. It was stated that the
                                Swiss who were naturalized in America refused upon their return to
                                Switzerland to fulfill their duties of Swiss citizenship when such
                                was inconvenient to them, invoking their newly-acquired citizenship;
                                and, on the other hand, when they found themselves in need of it
                                they reclaimed the aid and assistance of the Cantons and communes,
                                pretending that, notwithstanding their American citizenship, they
                                had not lost their rights of Swiss citizenship and still possessed
                                all the privileges belonging to a citizen, both cantonal and
                                communal. It was added that a position so equivocal and which could
                                be easily modified provoked conflicts, and that it was, moreover,
                                contrary to the spirit of the ancient country. But the National
                                Council itself rejected this amendment, which had been opposed by
                                such arguments as these: That in 1850 they had tried to remedy the
                                inconveniences springing from the “heimat losat,” and that now this
                                proposition would open the door anew to the same disorder; that it
                                was in contradiction of Swiss history and the development of its
                                public rights; that it was opposed to the sentiments of the people,
                                who held firm to the praiseworthy theory that one could never,
                                except by his expressed will, lose his right of citizenship in
                                Switzerland; that often it did not depend upon the free will of the
                                citizen that he had acquired citizenship in a foreign country, but
                                that in many countries he was directly compelled by circumstances to
                                naturalize himself; that thus in a number of countries, and, indeed,
                                in America, it was necessary to be naturalized before one could
                                acquire the power to own land, and that in certain of the German
                                States, where exists the system of concessions, citizenship was an
                                indispensable condition to the exercise of certain professions. It
                                was recognized that this double right of citizenship could give rise
                                to conflicts, particularly where the jurisdiction of tribunals was
                                concerned; but these inconveniences, it was urged, were not so great
                                that it should be necessary to discredit a theory widely upheld and
                                deeply imbedded in the hearts of the Swiss people, and especially
                                was this true when the acquisition of foreign citizenship had never
                                as yet occasioned to Switzerland any grave difficulties with other
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>The principle that a Swiss can not lose his Swiss citizenship except
                                he himself renounce it, has been thus maintained since the last
                                revision. But as the legislation of the Canton presented great
                                divergencies as to this renunciation, and as the right of
                                renunciation, even, was placed in doubt by certain Cantons, it was
                                declared in the project of the constitution of 1872 that this matter
                                was to be submitted to Federal legislation. And this amendment was
                                passed without change in the present constitution, of which article
                                44, or that part of it which concerns the present question, reads
                                thus No Canton can * * * deprive one of its citizens of the right of
                                citizenship.” “Federal legislation will determine the conditions
                                under which a Swiss can renounce his nationality to obtain
                                naturalization in a foreign country.”</p>
                            <p>The Federal Council has fully explained the signification of the
                                above in many notes addressed to foreign governments. It can be
                                summed up as follows: The right of Swiss citizenship can not be
                                proscribed; every Swiss conserves his citizenship as long as he does
                                not renounce it himself and as long as he can prove his descent; the
                                fact of his having acquired a foreign citizenship is not sufficient
                                to make him lose his Swiss citizenship; he preserves it even during
                                a prolonged sojourn in a foreign country, and even when he has not
                                paid his military and civic taxes in Switzerland; this is also true
                                if he has accepted military service or entered into the
                                administration of the foreign country; to lose his Swiss citizenship
                                a formal and express renunciation is necessary, which also extends
                                in its effect to his minor children; but in order to make such a
                                renunciation valuable or valid it is necessary to prove that he has
                                acquired domicile in another country or Canton.</p>
                            <p>From all that precedes it follows that the Swiss laws admit the
                                principle of double citizenship, which is prohibited in many
                                countries. Thus, in 1851, when the government of Onter Appenzell
                                Rhodes claimed the authority to withdraw the right of citizenship
                                from one of its citizens who wished to acquire citizenship in
                                another Canton, the Federal Council instructed it that this point of
                                view was contrary to the constitution, and that it would be obliged
                                to admit as established the right of recourse of a citizen of
                                Appenzell who complained against such a withdrawal of his <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0596"/>citizenship. The Federal
                                Council has also refused to ratify an article of the constitution of
                                Uri, in 1850, whereby it was sought to exclude citizens who, after
                                having acquired citizenship in a foreign country, had not .renewed
                                his Swiss citizenship within a certain time. The same decision was
                                made in an analogous case concerning the constitution of St. Gall,
                                in this sense, that the Federal Assembly reserved the right of
                                interpreting article 43 (present article 44).</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, it should be mentioned that the Federal Council has
                                declared inadmissible an ordinance of the Canton of Nidwalden
                                prescribing that the widows of its citizens, originally of the
                                Canton of Obwalden, should be returned to the charge of their
                                original commune. In a word, the acquisition of the right to aid or
                                assistance is a consequence of the right of citizenship, which,
                                under the terms of article 44, can not be lost.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            dispatches, Nos. 75 and 76, of the 15th and 18th ultimo, both in
                            relation to the claim of the Swiss Government to exact military service
                            from American citizens of Swiss origin temporarily sojourning or being
                            in Switzerland, and having particular reference to the case of Mr. F. A.
                            Schneider, a native-born citizen of the United States, who has been
                            ordered by the military commander of the district of Zurich to report
                            immediately for physical examination and military duty.</p>
                        <p>The Department can not see without regret the revival of this controversy
                            which has at intervals been so exhaustively argued in the past, and in
                            regard to which the duty of this Government toward its citizens can
                            admit of but one construction on its part.</p>
                        <p>It may be convenient, in view of the peculiar circumstances of Mr.
                            Schneider’s case, to forego for the present, without prejudice,
                            consideration of the allied questions involved in the cases of persons
                            of Swiss birth becoming naturalized in the United States, without
                            previous renunciation of Swiss citizenship, and returning to
                            Switzerland. As instructions of the Department have heretofore shown,
                            this Government can make no distinction between a native and naturalized
                            citizen in claiming for them the benefits of its treaties with foreign
                            States, although it may be recognized as a fact—regrettable but still a
                            fact—that the circumstances of the acquisition of American citizenship
                            by an alien may leave a conflicting claim to dual allegiance on the part
                            of the Government of the state of his nativity, should he voluntarily
                            return thither.</p>
                        <p>Mr. F. A. Schneider is, as you have previously reported in your dispatch
                            No. 45, of October 12, 1896, a native-born citizen of the United States,
                            his father at the time of his birth being lawfully invested with the
                            full and complete character of an American citizen by naturalization,
                            after compliance with all the requirements of the United States statutes
                            in that regard. He is not a citizen of the United States by any process
                            of municipal absorption; he is a native-born citizen of citizen
                            parentage. Whatever may be advanced in a contrary sense as respects the
                            dual status of a person acquiring another allegiance without the consent
                            of the State of his origin, this Government can not for an instant admit
                            that such a contention is applicable to the case of a native-born
                            citizen. So far as the knowledge of this Department exists—over more
                            than a century of intercourse with its sovereign <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0597"/>equals—no such contention has been
                            maintained by .any other Government, and if suggested has been
                            emphatically denied.</p>
                        <p>Even upon the careful statements you have recently made concerning the
                            Swiss rule of cantonal citizenship this extraordinary and exceptional
                            doctrine of inherited allegiance appears nowhere distinctly formulated,
                            and if it be put forward as a doctrine it not only finds no color in the
                            received teachings of international law, but it is in itself faulty
                            because apparently unlimited. There seems to be no end to the chain of
                            inherited subjection which must ensue should the Swiss premise be
                            admitted, for if a native-born son of a citizen of the United States can
                            be claimed by Switzerland as a citizen because his father was formerly a
                            Switzer, the grandson and the descendant of the remotest generations may
                            with equal reason, or rather with equal unreasonableness, be claimed as
                            Swiss citizens.</p>
                        <p>In the correspondence which took place in 1894 in respect to the case of
                            Frederic Tschudy, the present claim in its full extension did not
                            appear, the discussion then being partly as to the imputed dual
                            allegiance of Mr. Tschudy and partly as to the obligation of persons
                            sojourning in Switzerland to pay, under Swiss law, a military tax in
                            default of service, which is a matter regulated by treaty. In Mr.
                            Schneider’s case no theory of dual allegiance can be admitted by this
                            Government, and the offer of the interested party to remove possible
                            contention on the ground of liability to the military tax by tendering
                            payment of the sum, has been rejected. It seems that he is held to
                            service purely and simply on the alleged score of owing paramount
                            allegiance to Switzerland. In this respect Article I of our treaty with
                            Switzerland of November 25, 1850, appears to be distinctly contravened.
                            At the time that treaty was concluded there was no question touching the
                            attitude of the United States in the vital regard of citizenship. It had
                            been sedulously and strenuously maintained for half a century.</p>
                        <p>The doctrine that a state is competent to admit aliens to its citizenship
                            and to incorporate them in its body politic on a footing
                            indistinguishable from native-born citizens was proclaimed, asserted,
                            and enforced, and has become a recognized principle of public law among
                            nations with the exception of three States—Switzerland being one of them
                            and Russia and Turkey the other two—which hold to the doctrine of
                            perpetual allegiance, only to be dissolved by the consent of the
                            subject’s sovereign. But whatever may be argued as to the dual status of
                            an individual forsaking his native land and embracing the allegiance of
                            another Government, or whatever claim may be made that the treaty
                            between the United States and Switzerland may not specifically apply to
                            those precise cases, there can be no doubt that the United States
                            purposed and that Switzerland assented to the full protection of all
                            native-born citizens of the United States. It is for the benefit of such
                            that our treaties were and are concluded, and for their benefit we must
                            claim their full application. This is not a question of an even counter
                            poise of claim between two conflicting jurisdictions in which each may
                            in practice be supreme to enforce its own law over all affected persons
                            voluntarily resorting to its territories. Any theory of an equally
                            balanced conflict of the laws between the two states is absolutely and
                            necessarily excluded in the case of native-born citizens of either, they
                            being in turn the sons of lawful citizens.</p>
                        <p>It is proper that you should temperately but distinctly acquaint the
                            Swiss Government with the view here entertained of the present question.
                            Your firm and earnest remonstrance should be interposed in<pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0598"/>such shape as to leave no doubt in the
                            mind of the Federal Council of the sincerity of our attitude and of our
                            determination to uphold the rights of our native-born citizens, and the
                            council should not be left in ignorance of the severe strain which the
                            claim of indefinitely inherited allegiance so put forth in the case of
                            Mr. Schneider and any person similarly situated may perforce impose upon
                            the traditional and fast friendship which the United States feels for
                            Switzerland.</p>

                            March 24, in relation to the case of Mr. Frederic Arnold Schneider, an
                            American citizen, a copy of which note was inclosed to the Department in
                            my dispatch No. 83.</p>
                        <p>Immediately upon receipt of this reply I addressed a note to Mr. Germain,

                            Schneider’s case, and have just received his reply, in which he informs
                            me that Mr. Schneider is still absent from Switzerland awaiting his

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In your note of March 24, relative to
                                the military service of Mr. Frederic Arnold Schneider, of Pfaffikon,
                                Canton of Zurich, your excellency asks that the Federal Council
                                reconsider its decision of March 5 last, which, in your opinion, is
                                in harmony neither with the principles of international law nor with
                                the treaty of settlement between Switzerland and the United States
                                of November, 1850.</p>
                            <p>You observe that, Mr. Schneider being born in the United States of a
                                father a naturalized American, is beyond dispute a citizen of the
                                United States, and, therefore, entitled to the benefits of Article
                                II of the treaty, which exempts from personal military service the
                                citizens of one of the two countries sojourning or residing in the
                                other. Local or municipal laws, you add, by virtue of which Mr.
                                Schneider would be held to possess simultaneously the quality of
                                Swiss citizen, could not prevail, according to your point of view,
                                against the provisions of the said treaty, <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0599"/>which is applicable to all American
                                citizens, without excepting those of whom the parents are of Swiss
                                origin.</p>
                            <p>We regret the inability to recognize the logical basis of these
                                arguments, which we should regard rather as being in manifest
                                contradiction as well with the universally recognized doctrines of
                                international law as with the fundamental principles, beyond all
                                controversy, according to which a sovereign and independent state
                                determines for itself the conditions and the manner whereby the
                                quality of citizenship is acquired or lost.</p>
                            <p>We are far from contesting that Mr. Schneider may not be, by the laws
                                of the United States, an American citizen, but it remains no less
                                true that by our public law he is a Swiss citizen, and that as such,
                                finding himself within our jurisdiction, he is subject, in the same
                                manner as all other citizens of Switzerland, to the inherent
                                obligations of such quality.</p>
                            <p>It would be superfluous to repeat here what we have already stated
                                many times in the correspondence exchanged on the subject of a
                                projected treaty having in view precisely the regulation of this
                                matter. Your excellency, in fact, is not ignorant of the fact that
                                Swiss nationality, by virtue of a principle sanctioned by the
                                constitution itself, is, not lost by the simple fact of acquisition
                                of a foreign domicile, but only following a renunciation expressly
                                declared in the prescribed forms of the law of July 3, 1876. Now, if
                                neither the father nor the son, Schneider, has as yet made this
                                declaration, it follows that both are still citizens of their
                                commune of origin of Pfaffikon, and hence citizens of the Canton of
                                Zurich and of the Swiss Confederation.</p>
                            <p>We have certainly at heart the fulfillment of all our obligations
                                contracted by solemn treaties with other countries, and we would not
                                await the representations of your excellency to conform to the
                                convention of November 25, 1850, if it were really applicable in
                                this case. Article II of this treaty declares, indeed, that the
                                citizens of each of the two Governments shall be exempt, in the
                                other, from all personal military service, but there is not the
                                shadow of a doubt that in order to determine the persons who shall
                                be regarded as citizens of each of the two countries, the treaty
                                must necessarily be referred to the laws in force in each of the two
                                countries. It is, therefore, for Switzerland, the Swiss law which
                                determines if a certain person living in Switzerland should be
                                considered as a Swiss citizen; a contrary doctrine would imply the
                                pretention of imposing upon Switzerland legislation not its own,
                                which would be inadmissible and irreconcilable with its position as
                                a sovereign and independent state.</p>
                            <p>If the treaty of November 25, 1850, had the meaning which your
                                excellency wishes to attribute to it in your letter of March 24, it
                                would be difficult to understand what object the Government of the
                                United States had in proposing many times the conclusion of a treaty
                                stipulating, among other things, that “any Swiss citizen who has
                                been or shall be or is naturalized in the United States of America
                                conformably to the; law, shall be regarded in all ways and in every
                                manner by the Swiss Federal Government as a citizen of the United
                                States of America and treated as such by the Swiss Confederation.”
                                Such a stipulation would be, indeed, superfluous if Switzerland was
                                already obliged in virtue of the treaty of 1850 to recognize as
                                American citizens and to treat as such all who could prove having
                                acquired such quality comformably to the laws of the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>The attitude taken by us in this matter is that which we have always
                                taken toward all other Governments and that all other Governments
                                    <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0600"/>have taken and take
                                toward us. It is sufficient to recall, in this regard, the French
                                laws of June 26, 1889, and of July 22, 1893, the effects of which
                                were so widespread as to entail inconveniences upon many foreign
                                Governments. In order for the treaty to derogate internal
                                legislation and the constitution of Switzerland, it would have been
                                necessary to have a stipulation expressly including citizens of
                                Swiss origin naturalized in America, just as special treaties have
                                been necessary to settle like difficulties between the United States
                                of America and other Governments. Apropos of this can be mentioned
                                the conventions concluded by the United States of America with the
                                Confederated North German States February 22, 1868, with Austria
                                September 20, 1870, and with Belgium November 16, 1868.</p>
                            <p>We can not, then, in the absence of any international stipulation,
                                admit that Mr. F. A. Schneider, son of a Swiss citizen, not having
                                renounced his original nationality, should be regarded otherwise
                                than all other Swiss citizens and freed from military duty. Mr.
                                Schneider is not in the least forced to keep his Swiss citizenship
                                against his will. He can renounce it in the forms provided by law of
                                July 3, 1876, and, if he does not do so, it is to be presumed that
                                it suits him to remain a Swiss citizen in spite of the duties
                                inherently attached to such quality.</p>
                            <p>Besides, even in the case where the Swiss law would refuse to Mr.
                                Schneider the right of renouncing his original nationality, it would
                                not be disputed that Switzerland has the right to exact that he
                                fulfill his obligations toward her. This point of view was
                                participated in by an eminent American statesman, Mr. Daniel
                                Webster, Secretary of State, who, in a note of June 1, 1852, to the
                                Minister of Prussia to the United States [the Minister of the United
                                States near the King of Prussia], observed that if a government did
                                not accord to its subjects the right of renouncing their allegiance,
                                it could, in all justice, reclaim their services any time they were
                                found within its jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>We wish to hope that these explanations will suffice to convince your
                                excellency that, greatly desirous as we are of maintaining with the
                                United States of America the best relations and of being in accord
                                with your Government, we can not accede to the request made in your
                                letter of March 24 without departing from the laws and the
                                constitution confided to our safe keeping.</p>
                            <p>Receive, etc., etc., in the name of the Swiss Federal Council.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch No. 88, of April 27, has
                            been received. You therewith inclose copy and translation of the reply
                            of the Swiss Government to your note of March 24 in relation to the case
                            of Mr. Frederick Arnold Schneider, an American citizen.</p>
                        <p>But little appears to be gained in the way of detailed analysis of and
                            answer to the note of the Swiss Federal Council of April 20, inasmuch as
                            nearly all of the elaborate argument therein presented rests on a <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0601"/>fallacious disregard of the
                            essential point which the Department’s instruction and your note of
                            March 24 endeavored to present clearly to the Federal Government, viz,
                            that, whatever may be said touching the application of express treaties
                            of naturalization to the case of native subjects emigrating from one
                            state to cast their lot in another and to become citizens thereof by due
                            process of law, that conventional feature is wholly lacking in the case
                            of persons native-born citizens of citizen fathers. By no just process
                            of reasoning can it be claimed that such native-born citizens of citizen
                            parentage are in the category of emigrants of whom the native state may
                            exact renunciation of their original status as a condition to
                            recognizing the acquisition of a new status. It is impossible to admit,
                            even by way of argument that a person so born a citizen of any sovereign
                            state holds his birthright by any artificial title of acquisition such
                            as naturalization necessarily implies.</p>
                        <p>What the note of the Swiss Federal Council says, therefore, respecting
                            the necessity of treaties of naturalization to determine points of
                            allegiance not covered by the general treaties of amity and commerce
                            between states can not be admitted as having reference to the case of a
                            native-born citizen of a citizen father. The Swiss claim in this regard,
                            as you have been already instructed, is far in advance of that presented
                            by any country with which the United States maintain relations, and the
                            United States can not be expected to acquiesce in so exceptional a
                            contention.</p>
                        <p>It is observed that the note of the Swiss Federal Council rests its
                            argument in part upon a citation from a note stated to have been written
                            June 1, 1852, to the United States minister in Prussia by Daniel
                            Webster, when Secretary of State. The citation is not quite accurate,
                            for no instruction of the date and character described was written by
                            Mr. Webster. Under date of February 14, 1853, Mr. Webster’s successor,
                            Edward Everett, writing to Mr. Barnard at Berlin, in treating the case
                            of naturalized citizens of the United States who had been drafted into
                            the Prussian army upon their return to Prussia, refers to a letter
                            written by Mr. Webster to a notary public of New York, named J. B.
                            Nones, of June 1, 1852, in which, allowing for differences for
                            translation, much the same language is found as in the citation made by
                            the Swiss Federal Council.</p>
                        <p>It is to be insisted upon, however, that the reference is only valid to
                            the case involved, namely, those citizens of a foreign state who
                            emigrate in evasion or omission of military service and acquire another
                            status by naturalization. As to such persons the doctrine of dual
                            allegiance equally subsisting toward the country of origin and the
                            country of adoption, and necessarily regulated by a treaty of
                            naturalization, may be applied as an academic proposition; but in point
                            of fact the claim is not pressed, so far as known, by any State except
                            Italy and Russia, unless the emigration shall have been at or near the
                            military age and constitute of itself an evasive violation of the law of
                            origin. While the countries named have at times asserted that an infant
                            emigrant carries his dual condition during minority and subsequently
                            through life, neither of those countries has claimed that the yet unborn
                            emigrant, so to speak, being born of a father who has lawfully become a
                            citizen of the country of his birth, can be held for evasion of military
                            “duty toward the country of his ancestors.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the particular case which has given rise to this
                            correspondence, the Department approves your inquiry as to the present
                            status of Mr. Schneider’s case, and is disposed to await the result of
                            his renunciation of Swiss citizenship and application for discharge
                            there <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0602"/>from, which, as you
                            state, has not yet been granted. It is observable that throughout the
                            note of the Swiss Federal Council the right of renunciation of
                            citizenship is spoken of as pertaining to the individual, provided it be
                            declared in the prescribed forms of the law of July 3, 1876.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Although not recognizing the obligation of the
                            native-born American son of an American citizen father to make the
                            application of renunciation referred to, that procedure may afford a
                            practical solution to a position which otherwise is and would remain
                            intolerable as between two sovereign states. It remains to be seen
                            whether the release of Mr. Schneider from the peculiar claim of
                            Switzerland to his allegiance will follow his voluntary acquiescence
                            with the terms of the Swiss law on the subject or whether it may not,
                            after all, be discovered that the real point at issue is in the form and
                            manner in which a person claimed to owe Swiss allegiance maybe released
                            therefrom. It may prove that the canton reserves an equal discretion to
                            refuse to recognize the individual’s renunciation. It is, however,
                            trusted, in the interest of the friendly relations which this Government
                            earnestly desires to maintain with Switzerland, that such a contingency
                            will not arise</p>

                                Arnold Schneider, sr., the father of Frederick Arnold Schneider,

                            <p>I advised young Schneider when he first applied for protection at
                                this consulate, and all along during the pendency of his case, to
                                allow himself to be arrested or impressed into military service in
                                order to establish a precedent and a case to work on through the
                                good offices of <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0603"/>our
                                minister at Berne. This, however, he declined to do, and left the
                                country in preference, applying for a release from exile. His
                                request was granted, but only after his father paid the military
                                tax, due up to date of his release.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In answer to your favor of yesterday,
                                inquiring about the status of my son’s case concerning his rights as
                                a free-born American citizen while residing in Switzerland, I must
                                report, as you know already, that our former United States minister
                                at Berne had left my son so completely at the mercy of the Swiss
                                authorities that he could do nothing else, if he would preserve
                                untarnished his American citizenship, but to flee from the “Land of
                                Tell,” and then demand his discharge from Swiss claims according to
                                the formalities which the guardians of ancient. Swiss views would
                                dictate.</p>
                            <p>He got his release now, and I suppose should he return to this
                                country he would not be placed in chains or prison for adhering
                                faithfully to his native land and refusing to be pressed into a
                                foreign army, unless another flaw could be discovered whereby some
                                bloated busybody could have his fun with American citizenship.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: Miss Shattuck wishes very much to
                                write you this week, but had no time, so I write a few words in her
                                place.</p>
                            <p>You probably remember that the red ifs of Ourfa were sent away from
                                Ourfa very soon after the massacre by the Ferik Ahmed Loufti Pasha,
                                on account of their disgraceful behavior during those two days. In
                                their places came two Arab regiments, one from Maghara, in the
                                vilayet of Aleppo, and one from Hamid, in the vilayet of Damascus.
                                What is especially now brought to your notice is the fine record of
                                the colonel of the Maghara regiment.</p>
                            <p>This regiment has guarded those parts of the city in which the
                                Armenians live, and also all the region around our premises. Only a
                                single untoward incident, and that only affecting three or four men
                                out of the whole regiment, has occurred during all their long stay
                                here. They have won the entire confidence of the Christians. I may
                                add also that we have found the men detailed to watch over our
                                premises all that heart could wish. They have been very faithful,
                                very respectful, and very zealous in performing their duties.</p>
                            <p>There have been rumors that this regiment is to go home and [be]
                                dismissed. While certainly a very pleasant rumor for them, the
                                Christians of Ourfa have felt very sorry over such news. The
                                absolute confidence they now feel promises to change to entire
                                certainty [uncertainty], which can not but continue until the
                                disposition of those who take their place has been ascertained.</p>
                            <p>The colonel of this Maghara regiment has given Miss Shattuck to
                                understand that he would be pleased if she would bear witness to his
                                conduct here during these ten and half months. He has been so just
                                and so kind, and so zealous in protecting the Christians that it is
                                a very great pleasure to bear witness to his splendid record. Miss
                                Shattuck has had a short certificate prepared, which has been sent
                                to the Muschir Pasha in command, and if you can use the inclosed
                                copy <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0605"/>in any way that will
                                help him in the war office it will be a very great personal
                                favor.</p>
                            <p>Thanking you in advance in behalf of Miss Shattuck, yours,</p>

                            reports from the interior of the Ottoman Empire which tend to verify my
                            statements recently made, to the effect: <list>
                                <item>First. That no school taught by an American citizen in the
                                    Ottoman Empire has been closed during the present administration
                                    of Mr. Cleveland.</item>
                                <item>Second. That no Turks are either educated or converted by
                                    American missionaries. To my astonishment three Turkish students
                                    are reported in the inclosed letter from Mr. Fuller. (If they
                                    are really Mohammedans, their presence in the American school is
                                    exceptional, and I certainly think must be without the knowledge
                                    of the Mohammedan priests.)</item>
                                <item>Third. The value of the property owned by the missionaries and
                                    mission board.</item>
                            </list></p>

                            <p>As the second question is not complete, I can not answer it in full,
                                but I send you inclosed a copy of our “inventory of property,” which
                                may perhaps enable you to find the answers desired. If anything
                                further is desired, I shall be glad to assist you to the best of my
                                ability.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday was a great day of rejoicing here (Cesarea), for all the
                                political prisoners except three were released. These three have
                                been given a capital sentence, I understand, but with how much
                                justice I can not say. I am told that many Turks who are known to
                                have murdered Armenians in Cesarea and Everek have also been not
                                [set?] free. Early in the week we were greatly rejoiced to see that
                                the son of our best helpers, who have been in prison since October
                                4, was set free, and that, too, with specific and peremptory orders
                                that no “bribes” should be given to anyone.</p>

                            <p>The only Americans in this field, but those (3) fall under the
                                evident purport of your question. I beg are (9) the Central Turkey
                                College in Aintab, of which Dr. A. Fuller is the president; (6) the
                                Aintab Girls’ Boarding School * * * Miss L. Foreman is at present
                                principal; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) the Ourfa Girls’ High School *
                                * * Ourfa * * * Miss Shattuck is the principal. Just now other
                                affairs make it impossible for Miss Shattuck to give her time for
                                such work, but since the period in 1895, about which you ask for
                                information, she has given much time to the school, until the great
                                troubles made such work for the time impossible on account of the
                                pressure of the relief work.</p>
                            <p>In answering the remaining part of the question I am governed by the
                                rule which Mr. Pettibone told me was their rule at Constantinople,
                                viz, to call nothing American property which the mission considered
                                as given to the native congregations, even if the title is in our
                                hands. Per contra, some of our property stands in native hands.</p>
                            <p>The following is out-and-out American property, though in most cases
                                we do not expect ever to sell it, and really the first four are
                                owned in partnership with Americans: <list>

                                to their persons. On the contrary, during these times of trouble the
                                persons of all connected with our station, and the residences where
                                they lived, have been carefully protected. The first attack in Ourfa
                                may be an exception, but as the American premises were not attacked
                                no harm resulted. I presume you do not include retention of boxes
                                and stealing of horses in your inquiries.</p>

                                belonged to the Armenian congregation. I think Mr. Fuller put in
                                claim for damages, but do not know how it turned out. Of course no
                                redress has yet been given.</p>
                            <p>5. From Aintab to Aleppo, the nearest American consular post, it is
                                about 48 Turkish hours—about 144 miles.</p>
                            <p>6. This question can, of course, only be answered by each person for
                                himself. For myself, I have taken no inventory for years, and have
                                been burned out once; but, at a venture, think I could sell out for
                                less than $4,400 with great advantage to myself.</p>
                            <p>7. I suppose this question refers to book colporteurs exclusively
                                under American patronage and employment. If so, none have been
                                imprisoned since the date you mention. In our field, though, two
                                were imprisoned, then released under bonds, and finally
                                unconditionally released just a little before the time you
                                mention.</p>
                            <p>Hoping these answers will be satisfactory, I remain, yours,
                                respectfully,</p>

                                presume will answer for Aintab and the part of our field which lies
                                to the west and south of Aintab.</p>
                            <p>Since writing the above I have glanced over Mr. Fuller’s note, and I

                                answers are not difficult, as we have not had much, if any, trouble
                                previous to the great troubles of the last sixteen months. So I will

                                was in connection with this letter that I was “summoned” to appear
                                as a witness. Our Turkish watchman was also arrested, but he, too,
                                was released two weeks ago, and without bribery. We are glad to
                                report these two cases. Would that this custom might become
                                “epidemic.”</p>

                            <p>None of the above schools have, as far as I am aware, been closed by
                                order of the department of education, but as the result of the
                                disturbances.</p>
                            <p>2. Only two, as explained above: sixteen church buildings, ten school
                                buildings (school buildings are largely owned by natives), our
                                college, our girls’ seminary, several teachers, and missionary
                                houses owned by Armenians. The value I can not give without
                                consulting Mr. Sanders, who is now away. The value of this property
                                would be approximately $150,000.</p>
                            <p>3. Students in college, 135, three of whom are Moslems and the
                                remainder Armenian.</p>
                            <p>* * * Girls’s seminary, 85, all Armenian. I am not aware that any
                                proselyte has ever been made from Islam in any of our schools.</p>
                            <p>5. Of personal violence very little to complain of in this field. For
                                unfriendly acts, injuries, and losses I refer to my letter of August
                                12, 1896, and to statements above.</p>

                            <p>(2) As to colporteurs: Since the time, October, 1895, I think there
                                has been no attempt at colporteurs’ work in the field. My belief is
                                that <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0610"/>such work would not
                                have been permitted. Mr. Bowen, at the Bible house, can give more
                                information on that point.</p>
                            <p>What we have chiefly to complain of in addition to the destruction of
                                property and closing of schools and churches by the murder and
                                plunder and terrorizing of the people, for and among whom we are
                                chiefly working, is the disquieting and persistent efforts of
                                zealous officials to stir up hostile feelings against us and expel
                                us from the country. These efforts, I may add, have now apparently
                                wholly ceased, and the present attitude of Government officials
                                toward us is, outwardly at least, all that we could desire.</p>

                            <p>1. No schools taught by Americans in our mission station (Marsovan is
                                in our vilayet, but not in our Sivas station) have been closed since
                                March, 1893. Schools under American supervision and supported to a
                                considerable extent by American funds, but employing Armenian
                                teachers, have been broken up by the massacres in Gurun, Ashode, and

                                intermediate, and high—course of eleven years; Sivas Graded Schools
                                for Girls, primary and intermediate and high, covering a course of

                            <p>3. Average school attendance in schools taught by Americans: Sivas
                                Graded School (normal) for Boys, 300; Sivas Graded School for Girls,
                                300. All Armenians at present.</p>
                            <p>Besides the above, we are just founding two orphanages at Sivas, one
                                for Armenian boys and another for girls. We propose to care thus for
                                100 or more orphans, to whom the Americans will occasionally teach a
                                thing.</p>
                            <p>4. I have made a report of injuries to our mission work and sent it
                                to our Sivas consulate for them to add what information they have to
                                it and to forward all.</p>
                            <p>5. The distance from the missionary residences to the nearest
                                consular post is about a three minute walk, which brings us under
                                the United States and British flags, and a four-minute walk brings
                                us under the French tricolor.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: Your favor of December 30,
                                containing various inquiries with reference to our work, is
                                received, and in reply I would say that none of our schools have
                                been closed since 1893, though a school under our care at the
                                village of Agants, in the Kasa of Ajesh, was closed some years
                                earlier and considerable correspondence was had on the subject with
                                the legation, but with no result.</p>
                            <p>II. We have on one premises a school for boys and one for girls, in
                                both of which Americans give instruction, and a girls’ school in the

                            <p>III. The present number of pupils in the boys’ school on the premises
                                is 250 and in the girls’ school 200, while there are nearly 50 in
                                the school in the walled city, making a total of 500.</p>
                            <p>IV. No direct injury to American persons or property has been
                                inflicted within the time specified, but during the troubles in June
                                a boat load of grain belonging to the relief fund was stolen at
                                Ajesh, and though it is perfectly well known who took it, and the
                                consul has made demand for the return of the grain, and has, I
                                think, referred the matter to his embassy, nothing has yet been done
                                about it. At the same time a horse belonging to the relief was
                                stolen from one of the relief agents as he was returning from the
                                near village of Arshag, and though the zabtieh who was with him
                                testified as to the person who took it, and this matter has also
                                been brought to the attention of the Vali by Mayor Williams, nothing
                                has been done about it.</p>
                            <p>V. If Erzerum is considered as a “consular post,” it is a little over
                                200 miles away as the road goes, though less in a direct line.</p>
                            <p>VI. No real estate is owned by Americans in this province save what
                                is reported above as belonging to the A. B.C. F. M., but this is
                                held in the name of individuals. The value of the personal effects
                                of each individual is more difficult to determine. For myself, I
                                presume my personal belongings could not be replaced for $1,000,
                                perhaps not for $1,500, but if they were sold here they would not
                                reach that amount.</p>
                            <p>VII. No colporteur has been imprisoned during this period.</p>
                            <p>It is proper to add that there are medicines and surgical instruments
                                belonging to the board, having an estimated value of $1,500.</p>
                            <p>I trust that this report may be found satisfactory. I most earnestly
                                second the wish that “the era of distrust and violence” may soon be
                                among the things of the past.</p>
                            <p>I remain, etc.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose for your
                            information the copy of a letter just received from Rev. L. O. Lee, of
                            Marash, dated February 15, in which he states that the college under his
                            charge adjoins the French consulate, and that he has, therefore, had no
                            guards for several months, and that the general condition was improving
                            until the day of his writing, when stones were thrown at some teachers
                            “on their way <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0613"/>home from the
                            academy.” From this I infer that these teachers were resident natives
                            who lived away from the college.</p>
                        <p>I will, however, at once bring the incident to the notice of the Porte to
                            prevent its repetition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lee remarks that no facts are requested by me “respecting schools in
                            which our [their] workers are employed.” He adds that unless they are
                            protected “the reason for our [their] continuance in this land would
                            soon cease to exist.”</p>
                        <p>The dispatches from my predecessors and the report of Rev. H. O. Dwight,
                            dated October 18, 1893, and which was inclosed in my No. 1099, of
                            December 10, 1896, shows that over thirty of such schools were closed
                            before my appointment to this post. Such action did not disturb friendly
                            relations with Turkey during the administration of President
                            Harrison.</p>
                        <p>If the continuance of American missionaries in Turkey depends upon their
                            being protected in the right to establish and control schools when and
                            where they please, which are not to be taught by American citizens, and
                            which yet shall be free from the authority of the Turkish Government to
                            permit or close them at will, then the stay of missionaries here will
                            not be long.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lee’s letter makes a plain statement of the missionary claim. It
                            ignores the sovereign right of the Government to control at will the
                            education of its own children by its own subjects.</p>
                        <p>The American missionary alone among foreigners asserts this claim of
                            right. It is one for which I have never contended. My failure in this
                            respect has provoked resentment.</p>

                            copy of a letter from President C. C. Tracy, dated at Marsovan February
                            24, in which he expresses the opinion that the Turkish guard which is
                            kept for the security of Marsovan college should be retained. In this I
                            quite agree with him.</p>
                        <p>In many cases in Asia Minor our missionaries have, without consulting me,
                            caused the guard which I secured for them to be withdrawn. The little
                            American children are now nearly all out of Turkey, and I therefore
                            refrain from forcing upon the grown people the protection which they
                            thus reject.</p>

                        <p>My inquiry, to which Mr. Tracy’s letter is a response, was confined to
                            schools taught by Americans. It will be seen that he claims as American
                            schools five in which no Americans teach, but which are established with
                            American money. Thus missionary enterprise has projected itself eighteen
                            hours’ travel beyond consular protection, and established schools in
                            which the children of Turkish subjects are taught by subjects of Turkey.
                            The claim is often made that such schools should be protected by the
                            United States against any control by the Government of Turkey.</p>

                        <p>As a matter of course, this provision of Article II of the treaty in
                            question guarantees, in principle, to our consuls and officers the usage

                            of Turkey at Boston, had telegraphed to you that he had just been

                            suitable communication be addressed to the proper authorities in New
                            York to the end that the consul-general of Turkey, arrested in violation
                            of the article of the treaty to which you call attention, may be

                            civil suit, but on a criminal charge of embezzlement. He was detained in
                            New York with a view to his extradition to Massachusetts to be there
                            tried upon such criminal charge.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that this
                            legation is often at a loss to know what rule should govern in
                            determining when a naturalized American citizen, after returning to the
                            land of his origin and residing there for many years, has lost his
                            acquired citizenship.</p>
                        <p>This uncertainty has resulted largely from the fact that one Ghika, a
                            Greek, received a passport from your Department after he had returned
                            and lived many years in the land of his origin, with no property
                            interests in America, and when all these facts showed that his acquired
                            nationality had been abandoned. I refused him a passport; he obtained
                            one after a visit to Washington.</p>
                        <p>A case is now presented about which a specific instruction is desired,
                            viz:</p>
                        <p>Dr. Garabed Vartanian was naturalized as a citizen of the United States,
                            and returned to Turkey, of which country he was a native. Here he was
                            married, and has grown sons who can not speak the English language, but
                            claim American citizenship. He has a home here. He has no property in
                            America. He has never, I learn, manifested a disposition to return
                            during the last thirty years, and never left this city.</p>
                        <p>I again inform your Department that the ink in a majority of cases was
                            scarcely drying over half the certificate of naturalization seen at this
                            post before a passport had been issued on which the party returned to
                            Turkey, where he passed as an American citizen, claiming the protection
                            of two Governments, and yet so situated that he can not be forced to
                            respond to the demands of either. He almost invariably returns to stay,
                            and has no use for his acquired nationality except to be protected after
                            he has abandoned the United States with a view of permanently residing
                            abroad.</p>
                        <p>I can only regard such a proceeding as a fraud on our naturalization
                            laws.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch No. 1233, of the 8th
                            instant, has been received. You therein ask what rules should govern in
                            determining when a naturalized American citizen, after returning to the
                            land of his origin and residing there for many years, has lost his
                            acquired citizenship.</p>
                        <p>There is no mode of renunciation of citizenship prescribed by our laws,
                            and the Department hesitates, in any case, to declare that an American
                            citizen, whether native or naturalized, has forfeited his
                            citizenship.</p>
                        <p>Our statutes vest in the Secretary of State the power to regulate the
                            discretionary issue of passports, and to decline to issue them or to
                            authorize their issuance in cases where a citizen, native or
                            naturalized, <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0619"/>by the
                            circumstances of residence abroad, appears to have voluntarily foregone
                            the right to continued protection as a citizen while abroad. It may
                            happen that a person to whom a passport is refused, while abroad, may,
                            upon return to this country, establish his right thereto in the absence
                            of any judicial impugnment of his status. That was the case with the man
                            Ghika, to whom you advert.</p>
                        <p>The volumes of the Foreign Relations for many years past contain numerous
                            opinions and decisions of the Department to the effect that a passport
                            may be refused to a person applying therefor while abroad when the
                            circumstances show a purpose to reside indefinitely in a foreign country
                            or fail to show a reasonable intention to return to the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The case of Dr. Garabed Vartanian, the particulars of which are briefly
                            given by you, does not upon your showing appear to be one in which the
                            applicant is entitled to a passport and to continued protection
                            thereunder, unless his purpose to return to this country, here to
                            perform the duties of citizenship, within some reasonable time, should
                            be shown to your satisfaction and the statements of the declarant not be
                            obviously negatived by the circumstances of his domicile abroad.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The recent order of the Imperial
                                Government which requires all subjects of Greece to depart from the
                                Ottoman Empire in fifteen days has caused very many to apply to this
                                legation for protection.</p>
                            <p>This has not been extended, for I have no information that the
                                Government of Greece has requested the intervention of the United
                                States. But there are quite a number of peaceful Greeks who are now
                                in the employment of American citizens whose abrupt discharge would
                                result in serious pecuniary loss and would not fail to provoke
                                feelings of resentment among the people of the United States. I hope
                                that the Government of His Imperial Majesty will see the justice of
                                extending the time for the departure of such peaceful Greeks.</p>

                            <p>I have to report that on hearing the decree of expulsion of Greek
                                subjects I addressed the vali of Aleppo and Kaimakam here,
                                representing the condition this American corporation was placed in
                                by the said order, and supplemented the notes by personal
                                representation at the Kaimakamiyeh, but without securing practical
                                results. To-day, however, citing the instruction of the legation,
                                above acknowledged, the point which the Stamford Company principally
                                urged—permission for its chief Greek agent, Lionidas Marmaraki, to
                                remain until next week to settle his accounts—was granted by the
                                Kaimakam, with an understanding that the man should remain as
                                secluded as possible. To obtain wider concessions has proved
                                impossible, although I have urged them strenuously.</p>
                            <p>The agent of the company appeared before a commission now sitting to
                                determine questions of indebtedness of Greek subjects, accompanied
                                by the acting dragoman of this consulate, and recorded a statement
                                of the company’s position.</p>

                            relieve from the operation of this rule naturalized citizens of the
                            United States who have become such without the consent of the Sultan

                        <p>The letter of J. M. Seropian, which was inclosed in your dispatch, leaves

                            the land claimed under the will of his stepbrother alone or whether it

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your instruction No. 1460 of May 26. The “special law” to
                            govern the holding of real estate in Turkey by subjects of Ottoman birth
                            who have changed their nationality, referred to in Article 1 of the
                            legislative enactments printed on page 826 of the volume of “Treaties
                            and Conventions between the United States and other Powers,” edited in
                            in 1889, has not yet been enacted. Subjects of Ottoman birth who have
                            changed their nationality before 1869, or who have obtained the Imperial
                            sanction to a change made since that year, are considered as foreigners
                            and are subject to the provisions of Article 1 referred to above, while
                            subjects of Ottoman birth who have changed their nationality since 1869
                            without the Imperial sanction are still at law Ottoman subjects and
                            their naturalization is null and void. There is a provision of law by
                            which persons of this latter class may have pronounced against them the
                            loss of Ottoman citizenship entailing the forfeiture of their real
                            property. (Article 6 of the “Loi sur la Nationalité Ottomane” of the
                            19th January, 1869, and Article 111, with note of the Code de la
                            Propriete Fonciere in the “Legislation Ottoinane” annotated by
                            Aristarchi Bey). This provision of law has, however, never been put into
                            practice by the Ottoman Government.</p>
                        <p>It would seem that the large class of former Ottoman subjects who have
                            acquired American citizenship since 1869 without the Imperial sanction,
                            and who subsequently return for a longer or shorter sojourn in the land
                            of their origin, must in a majority of cases profit by a dual
                            nationality. As stated in No. 881 of May 23, 1896, all such persons who
                            are land owners in Turkey are unable to accomplish any act affecting
                            their real property before a Turkish tribunal or bureau unless they
                            accept the designation of “Ottoman subject.” It may therefore be stated
                            as generally true that the naturalized American of Armenian origin who
                            returns to this country and acquires fresh holdings of real property or
                            disposes, of property of which he is already possessed performs these
                            acts in the guise of a subject of the Sultan.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Riddle’s dispatch, No. 1331, of August
                            4, concerning the indemnity claim of Mrs. Haiganoosh S. Abdalian, has
                            been received.</p>
                        <p>The reply of the Turkish minister for foreign affairs, of which Mr.
                            Riddle incloses copy, disclaiming responsibility for acts arising out of
                            the recent disorders, is not satisfactory to this Government. His
                            excellency refers to previous expressions of denial to Mr. Terrell to
                            admit similar claims. A review of the correspondence in this relation
                            shows that in every case of this kind the Turkish Government either
                            ignores or distorts the abundantly supported contention of this
                            Government that the injuries to American property during the recent
                            disorders were suffered through the insufficiency of the protective
                            measures afforded. A government being able to quell and not quelling
                            such disorders, and damage to American property having resulted, the
                            United States contends that Turkey can be held responsible under a
                            well-recognized principle of international law. A general disclaimer of
                            responsibility, such as is set forth in his excellency’s present note,
                            can not, therefore, be accepted, and you are instructed to press for a
                            specific reply to the repeated demands of this Government that Turkey
                            acknowledge liability, urging the desirability of a just and prompt
                            settlement of this and other indemnity claims, that the friendly
                            relations which have hitherto existed between the two Governments may
                            continue uninterrupted.</p>
                        <p>For your better understanding of the position heretofore held by the
                            Department in this matter you should refer to the correspondence found

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Herewith inclosed find statement of
                            passports issued by this legation during the quarter ended March 31,
                            1897.</p>
                        <p>These three passports are irregular in that the persons receiving them
                            have all been absent from the United States more than two years, but
                            they are native-born citizens, and in danger of being surreptitiously
                            seized and forced into the army and sent to the front, as is being done
                            to foreigners as well as natives, and when seized they are not allowed
                            to communicate with anyone, and as no lists of the killed are made
                            public their fate would never be known if they fell in battle.</p>
                        <p>Hence I have taken the responsibility of issuing them passports, holding
                            that prevention of the outrage in these countries is better than any
                            amount of reclamation after the harm is done.</p>
                        <p>I have also issued protection papers in another form to eight native-born
                            and six naturalized citizens of the United States, to wit: Native-born:
                            John J. Golden, William Clagett, Ernest Clagett, Samuel John, Wilson
                            Kellogg, Edward Hall (colored), Henry Estrazulas, William Decker, James
                            E. Lensby.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your No. 119, of April 9, has been
                            received, and your statement of passports issued by your legation during
                            the quarter ending March <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0628"/>31,
                            1897, has been examined. The Department is disposed to overlook the
                            irregularity to which you call attention, as it is inclined to be
                            lenient in the case of native-born American citizens whose occupation in
                            a foreign country may represent native American interests, as is
                            presumed to be the case in the present instances.</p>
                        <p>This tendency to leniency is especially admissible in times of
                            disturbance like the present, when such citizens are threatened with
                            impressment into the army.</p>
                        <p>It is noted that you have also issued what you call “protection papers in
                            another form” to eight native-born and six naturalized citizens of the
                            United States, whose names you mention. You give the text of this
                            certificate, from which it appears that the document certifies that the
                            bearer “is a citizen of the United States and is entitled to protection
                            as such.”</p>
                        <p>It is supposed that these certificates of protection are required by the
                            local authorities in pursuance of some rule of registration or
                            matriculation such as prevails in the various Spanish-American
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The question of the issuance of such certificates came up for
                            consideration in 1894, when Minister Buchanan reported the custom of the
                            foreign consuls at Buenos Ayres to issue forms of certificates of
                            nationality known as “papeletas” in consequence of the regulations
                            governing the mobilization of the national guard, under which the police
                            had authority to arrest persons not reporting for duty unless they
                            presented a “papeleta” evidencing the fact of foreign birth or
                            citizenship, which, being the only form of certificate known to or
                            accepted by the Argentine police, was considered preferable to a regular
                            visaed passport. Those papeletas were required to be in the Spanish
                            tongue, and Mr. Buchanan submitted a proposed form for the stated
                            purpose. The Department ruled that any form which originally certified
                            the fact of citizenship was quite inadmissible, being simply a passport
                            in the Spanish language. The only certificate of citizenship issued by
                            the United States is a passport, and the giving of any document of the
                            nature or in lieu of a passort is not authorized. Mr. Buchanan was
                            instructed that only two ways of certification or matriculation of
                            American citizens were available—either (1) deposit of the regular
                            passport in the legation or consulate and of his registration in the
                            legation or consulate, or (2) indorsement on the passport itself of a
                            certificate in Spanish to the effect that the within passport attests
                            that A. B. is a citizen of the United States of America, and as such is
                            entitled to the rights and privileges of such a citizen in a foreign
                            country.</p>
                        <p>In view of this rule, the Department can not approve the “protection
                            papers” which you report having given to the fourteen persons named.
                            They should have applied for and received regular passports. If a
                            further protection paper in Spanish is needed, the form prescribed for
                            use in the Argentine Republic might conveniently be followed by you upon
                            the deposit of the regular passport in the legation or a consulate of
                            the United States, such certificate being given free of charge. The form
                            so authorized is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
