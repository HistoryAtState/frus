                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The
                    volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning
                    the facts which contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the
                    files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other
                    government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is edited by the
                    Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of State. The
                    editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in accordance
                    with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary of State
                        <persName>Frank B. Kellogg</persName> on March 26, 1925.</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in
                    the text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of
                    concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons: <list>
                        <label>a.</label>
                        <item>To avoid publication of matters which would tend to impede current

                        <label>b.</label>
                        <item>To condense the record and avoid repetition of needless

                            During the latter part of the period, U.S.-Indian relations became

                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Baghdad Pact</hi>. Pakistan’s adherence to the

                            of further efforts to improve their relations. The U.S. informed the

                        <p>18. The Prime Minister’s anti-communist, pro-Western orientation
                            continued during this period. Increasing pressure was placed on him,
                            however, by those with neutralist or leftist sentiments, or special
                            economic interests, to adopt a more friendly attitude toward the
                            communist world, particularly Communist China. Ceylon was informed that
                            the United States is prepared to negotiate an atomic research reactor
                            agreement under the President’s Atoms for Peace Program. The United
                            States also expressed its willingness to assist a voluntary agency in
                            providing Ceylon with powdered milk in the amount of 7,000 tons per year
                            for three years for a school lunch program. Economic assistance in the
                            amount of $5 million has been tentatively earmarked for Ceylon and is
                            broken down as $4.6 million for development assistance and $.4 million
                            for technical assistance. Ceylon was admitted to the <gloss

                            Nepal continued throughout the period to have a relatively weak
                            government. Satisfactory progress was made in the U.S. technical,
                            economic and information programs in Nepal. A Five-year Plan for
                            economic development has been published by the government. It is hoped
                            that the plan will be put into effect by July 1, 1956.</p>

                            unfriendly. The U.S. may have to decide whether to increase the level of

                                >NSC</gloss> 5617). At the conclusion of his briefing he called the
                            Council’s attention to the various splits, and suggested that the
                            Council resolve these splits in the order that they occurred. The first
                            split appeared in paragraph 29, on page 14, and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> suggested that the substance of
                            the split could be dealt with more effectively when the Council came to
                            a similar split in the courses of action in paragraph 69. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> then went on to the second split,
                            which appeared in paragraph 46, on page 18. As drafted by the Planning
                            Board, paragraph 46 should read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    including the use of force if a vital U.S. interest is involved:
                                    Provided, that the taking of military action shall be subject to
                                    prior submission to and approval by the Congress.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">The Joint Chiefs of Staff, however, had suggested the
                            addition, at the end of the last sentence of the paragraph, of the
                            following language: “unless the emergency is deemed by the President to
                            be so great that immediate action is necessary.”</p>
                        <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> explained why the

                            that he believed we were talking about something which was highly
                            academic. He said any President who was contemplating action of the sort
                            envisaged by the Joint Chiefs without resort to Congress would simply
                            have to pray over the wisdom of his action. Essentially this would have
                            to be the President’s own decision, and he could see no reason why it
                            was necessary to put the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proviso

                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> was of the
                            opinion that the question raised by the President was one of great
                            constitutional import. For example, if the Supreme Court were ever to
                            make a decision as to the constitutionality of military intervention by
                            the President without the consent of Congress, they might be strongly
                            influenced by a policy statement such as was proposed by the Joint
                            Chiefs as an addition to paragraph 46. In reply to this, the President
                            pointed out to Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>
                            that, after all, the National Security [Council] was nothing but an
                            advisory body to the President. It made no decisions of its own. It
                            merely recommended decisions which the President might take. Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> answered by
                            expressing fear that a doctrine might grow up that the President could
                            never act in emergencies of this sort without the prior consent of
                            Congress. This might be dangerous for the power of the Presidency. The
                            President responded <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0043"/>by stating
                            that, on the contrary, he believed that the omission of the proposed
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> language would actually
                            strengthen the hand of the President, who would make his emergency
                            decision without the benefit of any preconceived policy guidance.</p>
                        <p>Still not satisfied, Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                                >Stassen</persName> suggested amendment of the Joint Chiefs’
                            language by the insertion of the phrase “and vitally affects U.S.
                            security” after the words “so great” in the Joint Chiefs’ language. The
                            President, however, was unwilling to accept the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> proposal as amended by Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> ….</p>
                        <p>It was accordingly agreed not to include the language proposed by the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> then directed the
                            Council’s attention to the next split, which occurred in paragraph 51,
                            on pages 19, 20 and 21 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5617. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> pointed out that while
                            the Majority Proposal of the Planning Board called for fostering
                            conditions and government policies favorable to greater participation by
                            private enterprise in the economic development of South Asian countries,
                            the proposal by the Department of Commerce called for us to direct our
                            action in favor of private enterprise at the governments of the South
                            Asian countries. Moreover, the Commerce Proposal with respect to
                            fostering free enterprise in the countries of this area was considerably
                            more detailed than the majority of the Planning Board considered
                            appropriate. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> suggested
                            that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> might wish to
                            speak to this issue.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> commented that the
                            difference of opinion between the Majority Proposal and the Commerce
                            Proposal was not serious. He agreed that it was something of a matter of
                            semantics, but that the Commerce Department had been motivated by a
                            desire to make the courses of action in support of private enterprise
                            more specific and more in line with <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            economic policies applying to other parts of the world, such as, for
                            example, Latin America. He could, however, perceive no basic difference
                            of opinion between the two texts.</p>
                        <p>The President stated firmly that if in our dealings with other nations
                            the United States tries to impose its own economic system, the result
                            would shortly be self-defeating. It was obvious that we must fight one
                            enemy at a time. Our great enemy was Soviet Communism, and we cannot
                            argue with friendly nations about the wisdom of their form of government
                            without missing our chief objective, which is to counter Soviet
                            Communism. Moreover, every single country in the world, not excluding
                            the United States itself, has certain elements of Socialism in its
                            government and in its economy. In the case of India, where the average
                            annual income of the Indian citizen was less than $200, it seemed
                            obvious to the President that only government credit could do much to
                            achieve the <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0044"/>economic benefits
                            that the country required. In point of fact, it was fatuous to imagine
                            that private enterprise alone could achieve India’s economic
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> replied that if
                            this <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> document was to be made public
                            he would agree with the President; but after all, we were here dealing
                            with a secret directive. Secondly, he wished to point out that if we
                            would approach this problem from the angle suggested by the Commerce
                            Department, the result would be to encourage greater investment of
                            private U.S. capital in India.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Humphrey</persName> said that he
                            believed there were three more points to which the Council should direct
                            its attention. The first of these was the issue of encouraging private
                            enterprise, about which we had just been talking. Secondly, there were
                            in existence at the present time no less than three commissions or
                            committees engaged in the study of our foreign assistance programs
                            world-wide. In view of this fact, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> believed it was foolish to engage in a change
                            of our policy with respect to South Asia or any other country until
                            these commissions had made their final reports. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HG1">Humphrey</persName> said that his third point
                            related to the problem of the outflowing of our money. As the Council
                            knew, he said, he was terribly concerned with our imbalance of U.S.
                            payments. This was a very serious situation, and one that called for
                            radical action by the United States. He did not believe that the United
                            States was sufficiently rich to continue to see its dollars flowing out
                            in such profusion to foreign countries. We would therefore have to be
                            more selective in the matter of our payments abroad. Indeed, such
                            payments abroad might well run up to as much as $2 billion this year if
                            the imbalance of payments continued. In any event, no single country
                            policy paper should have money appropriated or earmarked for payment
                            independently of consideration of U.S. payments to all other foreign
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Humphrey</persName> then returned to
                            his first point—the question of free enterprise. He stated that India
                            was an extremely good illustration of why you cannot take money which is
                            developed from free enterprise in the United States and give it to a
                            foreign government with the expectation that that foreign government
                            will put this U.S. money into the development of private enterprise in
                            the country in question. As an illustration of the point he was making,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Humphrey</persName> cited the
                            unfair competition by the government-owned with privately-owned steel
                            plants in India, and predicted that the situation he was citing would
                            get worse for free enterprise rather than better. He concluded his
                            statement by asserting that the difference between Socialism and
                            Communism was mighty thin. The results were the same and, in point of
                            fact, we are <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0045"/>making use of our
                            own capitalist system to promote Socialism abroad.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that he simply could not agree with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Humphrey</persName>’s argument, and
                            insisted that we had quite a lot of Socialism right here in the United
                            States. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Humphrey</persName> agreed
                            with this latter statement, but pointed out that the Administration was
                            getting government out of business just as fast as it could, and that to
                            do so was the policy of this Administration.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> if he had ever read the new Indian Five-Year
                            Plan. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Humphrey</persName> replied
                            that he had not read the Plan, although he had seen copies of it. The
                            President proceeded to comment on certain highlights of the Five-Year
                            Plan, which was followed by a repetition by Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HG1">Humphrey</persName> of his arguments against
                            Socialism, with particular reference to the steel industry in India. The
                            President replied by noting the belief in India that some 17 large and
                            vital industries would have to be run by the Indian Government; whereas
                            the remainder could safely be left to development through private
                            enterprise. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Humphrey</persName>
                            believed that all 17 of these industries could be easily developed by
                            private resources if only the right kind of climate prevailed in India.
                            We should look at what we are doing with respect to investment in our
                            own country. It had never been at such high levels, and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Humphrey</persName> said he just did not
                            think it was right to take money away from competitive industry in the
                            United States and hand it over to government enterprise in foreign
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The President called Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG1"
                                >Humphrey</persName>’s attention to the fundamental objectives of
                            the United States in its foreign assistance programs—namely, to provide
                            assistance to non-Communist governments to save them from Soviet
                            domination. If we ourselves did not <gloss target="#t_AID1">aid</gloss>
                            countries like India, we could be sure that Soviet Russia would do so.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Humphrey</persName> answered that
                            if this was the way the Indians wanted to get their assistance, that was
                            the way they ought to get it. The President again said that he could not
                            possibly agree with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG1"
                                >Humphrey</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>
                            had on his hands a population of some 350 million people, many of whom
                            were living on the verge of starvation. No government in India could
                            stand aside and ignore such a situation, any more than the United States
                            Government could have opposed the development of social security for
                            Americans.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Humphrey</persName> was not
                            impressed with this argument, and stated that if Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> had a couple of good
                            managers running a private steel business in India, he would get good
                            results and would attract plenty of private capital from a variety of
                            sources, including the United States. The President admitted that this
                            was a possibility, but pointed out that if it were to happen, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Humphrey</persName> would still be face
                            to face with the problem of the <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0046"
                            />imbalance of U.S. payments. After all, it made no difference whether
                            the outflow of American funds was in the form of private investment or
                            of government grants or loans. To this, in turn, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HG1">Humphrey</persName> agreed, but said that even if
                            private U.S. dollars were to flow out to India, we should at least have
                            the assurance that our funds were being effectively used to develop
                            private enterprise. The President then mentioned that Sweden, with a
                            semi-Socialist economy, must be reckoned one of the most prosperous
                            states in Northern Europe. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> said he nevertheless believed that our economic
                            system was the best system. If the Swedish system were the best one, we
                            had better adopt theirs. The President answered that of course he too
                            believed that our system was the best system for us; but he was not
                            talking about us, he was talking about other countries such as India.
                            The President then suggested to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1"
                                >Lay</persName> that he move on to the next split. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName>, however, said he had a
                            suggestion for a change in subparagraph d of paragraph 51, on page 21 of

                        <p>With respect to this proposed course of action, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> reminded the Council that this
                            Government had been trying to get Japan to work out a proposed
                            restriction on the importation of Japanese textiles into the United
                            States. The above statement in paragraph 51–d seemed quite contrary to
                            the proposal on textiles. Accordingly, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> recommended that the whole
                            subparagraph be deleted or that, in any case, those words in the
                            subparagraph beginning with the adverb “particularly”.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he was rather inclined to agree on the wisdom of
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName>’ proposal, though
                            he also believed that in the long run only a general increase in world
                            trade, with the United States participating, would provide countries
                            such as India with what they require and wish. The President added that
                            he also was inclined to agree with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> that it was foolish for the Council now to be
                            making decisions on the shape of our foreign <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >aid</gloss> programs prior to having the findings of the several
                            commissions and committees who had been asked to undertake long-range
                            studies of these assistance programs. Why, in fact, were we required to
                            make such decisions at the present time?</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> explained the necessity
                            of developing at this time our mutual security program for Fiscal Year
                            1958. At the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1"
                                >Lay</persName>’s explanation, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> said he was still opposed to any decision at
                            this time on our <gloss target="#t_AID1">aid</gloss> programs for the
                            South Asian area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName>
                            also stated that it was already too late for the present policy
                            statement to have any effect on the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1958 budget. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> also
                            complained that the present policy statement bore no relation to the
                            findings of the <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> report
                                (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5610).</p>
                        <p>The President ordered the portions of subparagraph 51–d to which
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> had objected, to
                            be deleted. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said
                            that it was germane to notice that Japan was buying twice as much in the
                            United States as the United States was buying in Japan, and that the
                            policy in paragraph 51–d contained precisely the doctrine which we were
                            now preaching to Tokyo. He said that the State Department could probably
                            live with the subparagraph as changed by Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName>, but it would represent something
                            of a problem.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that he believed it to be a fact that in the long
                            run the United States would never succeed in straightening out its own
                            problems until the people of other countries managed to achieve higher
                            wages. There was, he said, also another view of his with which many
                            members of the National Security Council would not agree—namely, his
                            conviction of the folly of a U.S. policy which prevented the United
                            States from trading with Communist countries. But, said the President,
                            no one seemed to pay very much attention to his well-known view on this
                            subject. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Humphrey</persName> stated
                            that he would have to admit that he was on the President’s side with
                            respect to this issue (laughter).</p>
                        <p>After further discussion of the problem of private enterprise in foreign
                            countries, the President summarized his own position with a statement
                            that if the United States waits for private enterprise to flourish and
                            to solve all the problems which confront states such as India, we might
                            just as well tear up all these policy papers on Asia. Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> supported the President with a
                            statement that our own U.S. success in the sphere of private enterprise
                            depended in very large part on the creation and development of
                            successful economies in foreign countries.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then switched to the area of Pakistan, with particular
                            reference at the outset to the very large proportion of U.S. assistance
                            allocated to the military assistance program for Pakistan. The President
                            observed that we had decided some time ago that we wanted Pakistan as a
                            military ally. Obviously it had been proved costly to achieve this
                            objective. In point of fact we were doing practically nothing for
                            Pakistan except in the form of military aid. The President said that
                            this was perhaps the worst kind of a plan <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26"
                                facs="0048"/>and decision we could have made. It was a terrible
                            error, but we now seem hopelessly involved in it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> interposed to point out
                            to the President that the issue he had just raised with respect to
                            Pakistan was the subject of the next split in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                        <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName>’s explanation of
                            the Budget proposals in paragraphs 68 and 69, the President commented
                            that we had the same damned problem with Turkey. Mr. <persName

                                >Prochnow</persName>’s studies of the economies of these
                            underdeveloped countries, we seem to have paid no attention to his
                            findings in so far as they applied to Pakistan. Another objection,
                            continued Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName>, was that
                            the more military assistance we give to Pakistan, the more assistance
                            India in turn will expect from us. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1"
                                >Brundage</persName> said he could not understand why we did not
                            take a complete new look at our military assistance program for
                            Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> pointed out that the
                            Planning Board itself had expressed some anxiety over the force levels
                            which were to be maintained in Pakistan, but that the Planning Board had
                            felt that we had made a commitment to Pakistan with respect to this
                            program, and that from a political point of view we were obliged to live
                            up to the commitment. The President replied that he understood the
                            feeling of the Planning Board, but that he nevertheless felt that our
                            tendency to rush out and seek allies was not very sensible. Suppose, for
                            example, we undertook to make India a positive ally of the United
                            States. In such a circumstance, said the President, there wouldn’t be
                            enough money in the United States to provide the support that India <pb
                                n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0049"/>would require as an ally of the
                            United States. The President reiterated his belief that in some
                            instances the neutrality of a foreign nation was to the direct advantage
                            of the United States. The President confessed that he did not quite know
                            what to do about the military program for Pakistan. If we accepted the
                            proposal of the Bureau of the Budget for paragraph 69, it might have
                            severe repercussions on our relations with Pakistan, and might even
                            destroy the Baghdad Pact. On the other hand, the President expressed the
                            opinion that some skillful negotiator ought to try to induce the
                            Pakistani themselves to suggest changes in this military assistance
                            program over a period of time.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that the
                            President’s last suggestion was exactly what the State Department would
                            like to do–namely, to work toward some reduction of our military
                            assistance program in Pakistan while avoiding serious political
                            repercussions. He felt that this course of action could be carried out
                            if we were given sufficient time to do it. Moreover, the State
                            Department could accept the Budget language in paragraph 69 if this were
                            the interpretation to be placed upon it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> spoke briefly on the
                            nature of our earlier commitment to Pakistan with respect to force
                            levels and costs. He pointed out that the costs in practice had been
                            much higher than the original calculation. Nevertheless, we seem to be
                            stuck with it, for the Pakistani feel that we have made a certain
                            commitment to them, a view which is shared by the State Department.
                            About the only possible course of action left open to us in resolving
                            this dilemma was at least to avoid any further build-up of the Pakistani
                            armed forces.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that it would do no harm to try a little
                            education to these people. A little good common sense might ultimately
                            appeal to the Pakistani.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> then suggested
                            a possible substitution for the language proposed by the Bureau of the
                            Budget for paragraph 69. He suggested that instead of this language the
                            Council agree to adopt the language applied in a similar circumstance to
                            our assistance programs for Southeast Asia. This language read as

                        <p>1. South Asia has become a region of major international importance. The
                            five countries of the subcontinent have a population of about 500
                            million, twenty per cent of the world total. They represent a
                            significant segment of the world’s newly-independent, <pb n="30"

                            anticolonial countries. India, in particular, has emerged as a foremost
                            representative of the Asian-African, or “Bandung”, region and is the
                            leading political contender with Communist China in Asia. Pakistan
                            actively seeks leadership of the Moslem world and is the only Asian
                            member of both <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and the Baghdad
                            Pact. Three of the South Asian nations-India, Pakistan and Ceylon-are

                        <p>2. In addition to many special difficulties, South Asia exhibits many of
                            the political features that characterize less developed countries in

                                    have at least some appeal in the fifth country, Pakistan. This
                                    policy is not merely a philosophical attitude; these nations,
                                    and especially India, consider that their own national interests
                                    will best be served by independent international policy.</item>

                                    post-independence territorial and political disputes have
                                    operated to maintain tension between the South Asian states. The
                                    most serious of these are between India and Pakistan over
                                    Kashmir, and between Afghanistan and Pakistan over the Pushtu

                        <p>3. In recent years both the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            Communist China have waged an intensive campaign to roll back the free
                            world position in South Asia. No longer depending primarily on small or
                            illegal Communist Parties, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is
                            engaged in a vigorous and open diplomatic, propaganda, and economic
                            campaign to increase its influence in the area. Hundreds of South Asian
                            political leaders, technicians and cultural figures have been official
                            guests of Communist bloc countries over the last few years. The Soviet
                            leaders are identifying Soviet policy with the anti-colonialist
                            sentiments in the area; they are appealing to the area’s strong desire
                            for peace and non-involvement in world conflict. Finally, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is capitalizing on aspirations for
                            economic improvement through substantial offers of aid, trade, and
                            credits on easy terms and ostensibly with no political strings
                            attached.</p>

                        <p>4. A solid basis has been laid for the Indian national state by a series
                            of domestic political successes: in dealing with the princely states, in
                            conducting national elections, and in laying down a national
                            constitution. The revision of the Indian state structure along
                            linguistic lines has now been completed, thereby alleviating a major
                            divisive problem. However, India is confronted with a colossal problem
                            of economic development.</p>
                        <p>5. Despite substantial progress made under the first five-year plan
                            (1951—1955), the continuing problem of unemployment and underemployment
                            and the growing public demand for economic improvement have made
                            necessary higher targets for the second plan. Unemployment is increasing
                            in urban areas and provides potential tinder for political extremism.
                            The current plan places main emphasis on industrialization. This
                            involves deficit financing and heavy pressure on foreign exchange
                            reserves. It is evident that the new plan requires that India obtain
                            more than $2.0 billion from all foreign sources in loans and grants over
                            a five-year period, more than twice that received during the previous
                            plan period. Nevertheless, the higher targets are necessary if India is
                            to cope with its long-term economic problems and hold in check the grave
                            political dangers implicit in large-scale unemployment. The first two
                            years of the plan, in particular, will be critical, as the shift in
                            emphasis of development activity will severely strain India’s ability to
                            manage the inflationary pressures of the new approach.</p>
                        <p>6. Should India fall significantly short of the projected expansion
                            during the crucial next five years and lose the momentum it has gained
                            under <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s leadership, it is
                            unlikely to regain this momentum during the foreseeable future. A period
                            of economic and political decline would almost certainly set in, popular
                            support for the Congress Party would diminish, dissension would grow
                            both inside and outside the Congress Party, and unrest would ensue.</p>
                        <p>7. India’s economic development program has international political
                            ramifications as well. The outcome of the competition between Communist
                            China and India as to which can best satisfy the aspirations of peoples
                            for economic improvement, will have a profound effect throughout Asia
                            and Africa. Similarly, the relative advantages to be derived from
                            economic cooperation with the Soviet bloc or the West will be closely
                            watched.</p>
                        <p>8. In relation to its size and population, India maintains a relatively
                            modest though by no means negligible military establishment. India’s
                            abiding concern is to maintain its present margin of superiority over
                            Pakistan. India will continue to purchase military equipment from abroad
                            to modernize its forces, particularly in view <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32"
                                facs="0054"/>of the anticipated increase in Pakistani combat
                            capabilities as a result of U.S. aid.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Pakistan</hi></p>
                        <p>9. Despite its success in coping with the weighty problems which
                            confronted it at the outset, Pakistan after nine years of independent
                            existence still lacks many of the basic ingredients of internal
                            stability. The eastern and western parts of the country, separated by
                            about a thousand miles of Indian territory, represent two widely
                            disparate cultural groups, differing from each other in language, social
                            and economic structure, and outlook. Islam is now less of a force for
                            national unity than it was at the inception of Pakistan, and has
                            increasingly become a source of fundamentalist opposition to the
                            development of a modern secular state. The Muslim League, which
                            Pakistan’s original leaders used as a vehicle of political control, has
                            steadily degenerated, and no effective rival organizations have emerged
                            to take its place. Although much of the Pakistani population remains
                            ignorant and apathetic about political matters, chronic political
                            instability, recurrent economic crises, and continuing frustration over
                            relations with its neighbors, particularly India, have all contributed
                            to growing popular dissatisfaction with the present state of
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>10. Although the viability of its democratic processes has yet to be
                            assured, Pakistan has nevertheless maintained its national unity, and
                            has made progress toward the development of parliamentary institutions
                            and the resolution of the problems inherent in the linguistic and
                            geographic separateness of East Pakistan. Pakistan has also accomplished
                            significant gains in industrial development, and is about to undertake a
                            new five-year development plan that will place heavy emphasis on
                            improving the agricultural, power and transportation bases of the
                            economy. The plan’s goals are directed to a major extent to remedying
                            the recurrent food crises, particularly in East Pakistan, where poor
                            marketing and storage facilities and inept administration have
                            aggravated the problems arising from poor harvests of recent years.
                            Heretofore Pakistan’s economic program has not received the degree of
                            emphasis placed on economic planning in India. In fulfilling the plan,
                            the immediate bottleneck seems likely to be technical and administrative
                            skills.</p>
                        <p>11. The Government of Pakistan has developed policies essentially
                            pro-West in outlook and generally pro-United States in implementation,
                            although its adherence to the Baghdad Pact and to <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> has been motivated largely by fear
                            of India’s preponderant military position and its own bitter differences
                            with Afghanistan.</p>
                        <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0055"/>
                        <p>12. Pakistan is in the midst of a military build-up based upon a
                            commitment by the United States to provide equipment.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d5fn2">See <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5610,
                                Pakistan study. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Pakistan will
                            probably continue to make heavy expenditures on its military
                            establishment. However, maintenance of that establishment will require
                            continuing U.S. matériel and direct forces support not only through the
                            expected completion of the present military aid program in 1959 or 1960
                            but probably for an indeterminate period. The present Pakistan armed
                            forces (which include about 8½ under-strength divisions) are considered
                            adequate to maintain internal security and defend against attack by
                            Afghanistan. The equipment build-up will add to this ability to resist
                            an initial aggressive thrust by limited Soviet capabilities,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d5fn3">Estimated in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5610
                                as 3 to 6 Soviet divisions. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                            and will increase to some extent Pakistan’s ability to deter aggression
                            and to contribute to collective security.</p>
                        <p>13. Sufficient economic development to indicate continuing progress is
                            estimated as necessary to ensure popular allegiance and reasonable
                            stability in Pakistan. The new economic development plan would require
                            Pakistan to obtain some $800 million from all foreign sources in loans
                            or grants over the next five years. Technical and administrative
                            obstacles to planned investments will probably be lessened by 1958 so
                            that the increasing need for resources for economic development will
                            coincide with the increasing costs of maintaining the military
                            establishment. The issues are not unmanageable, but they could cause
                            serious friction between the United States and Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>14. Pakistan, as a major Muslim power, can exert a moderating influence
                            on the extreme nationalism and anti-Western attitudes of the Arab
                            states. Pakistan’s position on the Suez issue has been helpful to the
                            United States. It is in our national interest to continue to urge
                            Pakistan to take an active role in Middle Eastern affairs.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Afghanistan</hi></p>
                        <p>15. The political scene in isolated and primitive Afghanistan is
                            pervasively colored by the dispute with Pakistan over the Pushtu or
                            Pathan tribes living in the northwest frontier area of Pakistan. As a
                            consequence of Afghanistan’s effort to win political autonomy for these
                            tribes, relations with Pakistan are chronically embittered and
                            Afghanistan’s political and geographic isolation from the rest of the
                            free world has been made more complete. This dispute, combined with
                            Afghanistan’s desire for rapid economic development, has made its
                            leaders receptive to offers of Communist bloc economic, technical and
                            military assistance. Such assistance has been extended on an <pb n="34"
                                xml:id="pg_34" facs="0056"/>impressive scale. Afghanistan has
                            already incurred so heavy a burden of debt to the Communist bloc as to
                            threaten its future independence.</p>
                        <p>16. At the same time, traditional Afghan suspicions of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> almost surely persist. The Afghans
                            are willing to accept Western assistance and technical advice and hope
                            to have the best of both worlds. Through our past aid on the
                            multi-purpose Helmand River project, the United States is identified
                            with an undertaking of major significance for Afghanistan’s economic
                            future.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Ceylon</hi></p>
                        <p>17. So long as British military bases can be maintained there, Ceylon has
                            a potential strategic importance far beyond its small size and
                            population. The neutralist and leftist trends in Asia have substantially
                            engulfed Ceylon and threaten the British bases on the island and even
                            Ceylon’s membership in the British Commonwealth. There is also hostility
                            toward the large Indian (Tamil) minority. Political developments in
                            Ceylon thus endanger its relationships both with the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and with India. Its principal economic
                            problem arises from the phenomenal rate of its population growth. Thus
                            far Ceylon remains oriented to Western values and to Western political
                            institutions, and seems to wish to avoid serious deterioration in its
                            relations with India.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Nepal</hi></p>
                        <p>18. India views Nepal as a virtual Indian protectorate and is resentful
                            of third-power activities there. Nepal is an object of Communist China’s
                            attention and thus a potential source of rivalry between India and the
                            Communist Chinese. Recently India has attempted to improve its position
                            in Nepal in the face of increased efforts by the Chinese Communists to
                            expand their influence. The Nepalese, for their part, are restive under
                            Indian attempts to monopolize Nepal’s external political relations and
                            to guide Nepalese domestic policy.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Policy Conclusions</p>
                        <p>19. The capability of the United States to shape events in South Asia is
                            severely limited. The United States cannot in the foreseeable future
                            expect to bring the four neutralist South Asian countries into regional
                            defense alliances. It cannot rely upon full support from the area for
                            U.S. policies when these touch upon the colonial problems of its free
                            world allies. It cannot fully satisfy the needs of the South Asian
                            countries for external economic assistance. Nevertheless, much can be
                            done to prevent South Asia from becoming pro-Communist. <pb n="35"
                                xml:id="pg_35" facs="0057"/>Progress can be made in increasing South
                            Asian resistance to Communist ambitions and in fostering its recognition
                            of its community of interest with the free world.</p>
                        <p>20. The political stake of the United States in the independence and
                            integrity of the countries of South Asia, as well as in their stability
                            and peaceful progress, is very large. If India or Pakistan came under
                            Communist influence, chain reaction effects, going as far as Western
                            Europe, would result. Serious political instability in either or both of
                            these large nations would significantly increase Communist influence in
                            the area or, alternatively, might lead to hostilities in South Asia.
                            Either turn of events could engage great power interests to the point of
                            threatening world peace.</p>
                        <p>21. It remains necessary, therefore, to employ the limited means at our
                            disposal as effectively as possible in South Asia. This will require
                            policies developed country by country, but it will also continue to
                            involve us in intraregional issues and we shall probably find it
                            increasingly necessary that we seek to resolve or at least to keep under
                            control the local controversies that bulk so importantly in the
                            political life of the subcontinent.</p>
                        <p>22. Pakistan’s differences with India and Afghanistan will continue to
                            complicate our relationships in South Asia. A mutually acceptable
                            resolution of the Kashmir issue and the early resolution of other
                            differences must be an important aim of U.S. policy.</p>
                        <p>23. Participation by the South Asian countries in regional organizations,
                            such as the Colombo Plan and the Economic Commission for Asia and the
                            Far East (<gloss target="#t_ECAFE1">ECAFE</gloss>), particularly in the
                            economic and technical spheres, and the membership of India, Pakistan
                            and Ceylon in the Commonwealth, strengthen the ties between South Asia
                            and the rest of the free world. It is in the best interests of the
                            United States to encourage closer economic cooperation among the South
                            Asian countries, and between them and the other free world countries.
                            Assistance should therefore be extended when feasible to foster regional
                            projects of economic importance to the area and to other free world
                            countries in Asia.</p>
                        <p>24. The development and application in South Asia of the peaceful uses of
                            atomic energy, under U.S. leadership, will be particularly important for
                            its potential unifying influence as well as its direct benefits to the
                            nations involved.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">India</hi></p>
                        <p>25. It is in the U.S. national interest that the genuine independence of
                            India be strengthened and that a moderate, non-Communist government
                            succeed in consolidating the allegiance of the Indian people. There is
                            an undeniable dilemma for U.S. policy in the <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36"
                                facs="0058"/>pursuit of these objectives. The Indian policy of
                            non-alignment will on occasion bring India into opposition with U.S.
                            programs and activities, and a strong and increasingly successful India
                            will add weight to this opposition. Nevertheless, over the longer run,
                            the risks to U.S. security from a weak and vulnerable India would be
                            greater than the risks of a stable and influential India. A weak India
                            might well lead to the loss of South and Southeast Asia to Communism. A
                            strong India would be a successful example of an alternative to
                            Communism in an Asian context and would permit the gradual development
                            of the means to enforce its external security interests against
                            Communist Chinese expansion into South and Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>26. The second five-year plan provides at present the best vehicle for
                            action to promote U.S. interest in an independent and stable India.
                            India must have external assistance to attain the goals of the plan as
                            it is now envisaged. It would appear that Western sources of aid other
                            than the United States will fall short of the mark. It is in our
                            interest that India should substantially achieve the broad aims of the
                            five-year plan, in terms of increases in output and employment, and
                            should continue to make an effective assault upon its development
                            problems. The United States should not, of course, engage its prestige
                            in the success of the program.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Pakistan</hi></p>
                        <p>27. It is in the U.S. national interest that Pakistan, as an active ally
                            of the United States within the area, should strengthen its
                            independence, make sufficient economic progress to assure the allegiance
                            of its people, and improve its internal stability and defensive
                            capabilities.</p>
                        <p>28. Without substantial external assistance, Pakistan’s limited resources
                            are inadequate either to sustain the burden of its military build-up or,
                            after the build-up period, to bear both military maintenance costs and
                            the needs of economic growth. There is only a slight prospect that in
                            the early post-build-up period Pakistan could, unaided, support even one
                            of these programs.</p>
                        <p>29. In the absence of a Pakistani desire for a reduction of the military
                            burden, failure by the United States substantially to fulfill its
                            commitment to Pakistan: could jeopardize the U.S. political position in
                            the area and weaken planned defenses designed to protect U.S. interests
                            in the Middle East; could lead Pakistan to retreat from its present
                            anti-Communist pro-Western policy; and could alienate the Pakistan
                            military, which is potentially the most stable and actively the most
                            cooperative element in Pakistan society. Accordingly, it is in the U.S.
                            national interest to complete the <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0059"
                            />military aid program, with its delivery schedules through <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960, which represent the U.S. commitment
                            to Pakistan, unless the Pakistani agree to reduce the commitment in
                            accordance with paragraph 69 hereof. Carrying out of the present
                            military program, on the other hand, will adversely affect Pakistan’s
                            ability to meet economic development goals, and possibly India’s desire
                            to avoid increasing its military expenditures. Our economic aid program
                            should be aimed at increasing the future economic capabilities of
                            Pakistan to carry a larger share of its necessary military expenditures,
                            as well as increasing its political and administrative ability to make
                            the most effective use of its military resources.</p>
                        <p>30. Ultimately the possibility of a reduction in Pakistan’s requests for
                            U.S. military assistance will be markedly affected by improvement in its
                            relations with India and Afghanistan. Accordingly, the narrowing of
                            Pakistan’s differences with its non-Communist neighbors should be an
                            important aim of U.S. policy in the area. Some time before the end of
                            the build-up period and in the light of the circumstances then
                            prevailing, the United States will have to negotiate an understanding
                            with Pakistan on the character and amount of future U.S. assistance. The
                            object of such negotiations should be to achieve agreement on programs
                            which will reduce so far as feasible the continuing burden of assistance
                            on U.S. resources and on the local economy and which will offer
                            prospects for greater Pakistan self-support.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Afghanistan</hi></p>
                        <p>31. U.S. policy in Afghanistan can be most effective in assisting in the
                            economic development of the country, promoting closer trade ties with
                            Pakistan and resolving the in-transit trade issues with Pakistan. We are
                            already deeply involved in the Helmand Valley, both financially and in
                            terms of American prestige, and it will be highly desirable if the
                            project can be brought forward to successful fruition. We do not have
                            within our power wholly to quiet Afghan agitation over the Pushtunistan
                            issue, but it may be possible, by assisting the improvement of
                            communications through Pakistan to Afghanistan, to bring about closer
                            and more amicable Afghan—Pakistan relations and also give Afghanistan an
                            alternative to its dependence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"

                        <p>32. As is the case of India, Ceylon’s need for economic assistance gives
                            us potentially our most useful policy lever for keeping strongly
                            neutralist Ceylon from extending its ties with the bloc or from turning
                            pro-Communist. It is unlikely that Ceylon can be <pb n="38"
                                xml:id="pg_38" facs="0060"/>moved from neutralism by any actions we
                            can take, but it is entirely probable that Ceylonese independence will
                            be secure so long as its government exhibits some capacity for dealing
                            with its domestic economic problems. U.S. aid programs initiated in 1956
                            should be directed toward these ends.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Nepal</hi></p>
                        <p>33. The United States has an interest in preventing Nepal from being
                            overrun or dominated by Communist China. These are possibilities of even
                            more urgent concern to India, which regards Nepal as a virtual
                            protectorate. In view of the persistent distrust between India and
                            Nepal, and of the vastly greater U.S. stake in India, U.S. interests
                            would be served by a policy of close but informal consultation with
                            India in regard to free world economic and security interests in
                            Nepal.</p>

                                            Prime Minister was impressed by U.S. economic and

                                            Afghanistan were diminished as a result of efforts by
                                            both governments. The two countries agreed to

                                            of friction and tension. Pakistan’s relations with India
                                            continued tense, primarily because of the unsettled

                                        however, been no marked deterioration in U.S.-Ceylon
                                        relations. The internal political situation there was marked
                                        by increasing communal tension between the Sinhalese and the

                                        coordination within the coalition cabinet. At the same time

                                        Ceylon’s future. There were occasional, irresponsible

                                        the development programs of the South Asian countries, as
                                        well as to the adequacy of their food production. Even if
                                        these countries successfully meet their current economic
                                        development goals, their planned increases in per capita
                                        income and standard of living may be nullified by their
                                        rising rates of population growth. In Ceylon, for example,
                                        public health measures already have reduced mortality in the
                                        past ten years to the extent that the rate of population
                                        growth has doubled. Equally serious are the increases in
                                        population taking place in India and Pakistan. It is evident
                                        that these countries have, in their developmental planning,
                                        substantially underestimated their rate of growth, which
                                        threatens a doubling of their population each generation.
                                        One immediate problem facing these countries as a result of
                                        population growth is the fact that their imports of food are
                                        already exceeding planned levels.</item>

                                        the country’s 1,400-mile border with the Soviet Union and
                                        its near isolation from sources of Free World strength are
                                        basic factors affecting Afghanistan’s international
                                        position. The Afghans profess to understand Soviet motives
                                        and to desire closer association with the Free World.
                                        However, geographic realities have forced them to maintain a
                                        neutral posture between East and West. These realities also
                                        limit the capability of Afghanistan to achieve what it
                                        regards as its minimum economic and security needs through
                                        association with the Free World alone. In particular, the
                                        substantial Soviet assistance to the Afghan military
                                        establishment and the presence of Soviet military advisers
                                        may be an inhibiting factor in Afghanistan’s future

                                        Pakistan naturally regards the status of its Pushtuns as a
                                        purely internal matter. Afghanistan’s principal routes of
                                        communications with the Free World lie through Pakistan (via
                                        the port of Karachi). Therefore, the Pushtun question has
                                        been a major impediment to closer Afghan-Free World
                                        relations. Both Pakistan and Afghanistan have in recent

                                <p>“The Ambassador then took up the Kashmir question. He said the
                                    Pakistan Prime Minister would make another effort to see Prime
                                    Minister <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> but there
                                    seemed little basis for hoping these discussions would result in
                                    much progress. However, the Ambassador believed that if the U.S.
                                    and Great Britain would in some way try to make their influence
                                    felt with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> this
                                    would help a great deal.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that we
                                    would give this some consideration but that he was not at all
                                    optimistic that anything could be done to influence the Indian
                                    Prime Minister. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>
                                    said that indeed he shared the Ambassador’s skepticism over the
                                    possibility of progress from discussions with Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>. The latter has seized on
                                    U.S. military aid to Pakistan as an excuse to go back on the
                                    Indian commitment for a plebiscite in Kashmir. There are grounds
                                    for wondering if <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>
                                    would ever do anything about the issue in view of the emotional
                                    attachment of himself and his family to Kashmir. However, the
                                    Indian Prime Minister has never succumbed to the tendency or
                                    temptation to seek support through arousing religious feelings.
                                    Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said he
                                    genuinely believed <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>
                                    wants every Indian to be equal under the law–though the fact is,
                                    many Muslims in India, in Hyderabad for example, are having a
                                    difficult time. This policy of the Indian Prime Minister
                                    strengthens him, of course, in his appeal to the Muslims of
                                    Kashmir to join without fear in the Indian secular state.”

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJS1">Cooper</persName> said he would
                            like to refer to US military aid to Pakistan, which in his opinion
                            constituted the greatest obstacle in the establishment of friendly
                            relations between the US and India. The Indians did not fear that the
                            Pakistanis would conquer them in a war. They strongly opposed US
                            military aid to Pakistan, however, because they thought that arming
                            Pakistan, as well as our policy of supporting regional military pacts,
                            chiefly in Asia, increased the chance of war. The Indians also resented
                            the fact that partly because of our military assistance to Pakistan they
                            had to divert substantial funds from economic development to increasing
                            their own defenses. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJS1"
                                >Cooper</persName> thought that the Indians were somewhat reconciled
                            to fulfillment by the US of its original commitment to Pakistan for
                            military aid but that there would be the strongest repercussions if the
                            US either increased the existing and committed military program or
                            established bases in Pakistan. The Ambassador also believed that if the
                            US took either of the foregoing actions it was probable that the Indians
                            might be led to obtain arms from the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> recalled that at the
                            time we had entered into the military assistance agreement with
                            Pakistan, we had informed Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> that we were prepared to negotiate a military
                            assistance program with India. Why did the Indians feel it necessary to
                            buy arms from the Soviet Union when they could also obtain them from the
                            US? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that it was
                            difficult for him to understand the Indian point of view on this
                            question; he wondered what positive action the US Government could take
                            in order to solve the problem which resulted from the establishment of
                            our military assistance program with Pakistan. Ambassador Cooper replied
                            that <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0085"/>one thing which we could do
                            was to make the “Green Satin” equipment<note n="2" xml:id="d13fn2">A

                        <p>162. For Secretary of State. I am sending this message to call attention
                            to subjects which I assume will arise during the <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Conference,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d14fn2">Pakistan was an original member of the Southeast

                        <p>1. U.S. military aid to Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>The U.S.—Pakistan military agreement is unquestionably the chief cause of
                            friction between the U.S.—Government of India. Aside from the merits of
                            U.S. reasons for the pact, which this message does not argue, India
                            considers the agreement: <list>
                                <label>(a)</label>
                                <item>An unfriendly act toward Government of India considering the

                            </list></p>
                        <p>Perhaps most important, the Government of India does not believe that
                            Pakistan wants arms for defense against Russia. It fears that with less
                            responsible leadership than Pakistan enjoys at present and in event of
                            internal crisis, Pakistan might be tempted to undertake military
                            adventure against India.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that Indian feeling against the original U.S.—Pakistan

                            resentments in India.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. can argue that India should know the balance of armed strength
                            is favorable to India and its fears are unreasonable. Nevertheless,
                            Government of India officials express these considerations which
                            influence their thinking.</p>

                                arms agreement and whether its implementation would give Pakistan a

                            <item>It does not know whether new agreements for the supply of

                                favorable arms ratio to Pakistan, in view of the fact that Indian

                        </list>
                        <p>I have been informed that because of these uncertainties and fears, some
                            Government of India officials including the military, are arguing, that
                            the Government of India should [take?] modern arms, even from Russia, to
                            properly provide for its defense.</p>
                        <p>The Government of India does not accept the U.S. argument that it could
                            similarly secure arms from the U.S. This is so, because it does not want
                            to enter a military agreement contradicting its general policy, or in
                            the absence of an agreement, it does not want to enter an arms race.</p>
                        <p>The supply of Indian arms by the United Kingdom is also being questioned
                            as the Government of India believes that in event of war between India
                            and Pakistan, the United Kingdom would deny supplies to both, while the
                            question of U.S. supply to Pakistan would be unknown.</p>
                        <p>On other side, Indian press is currently playing up border incidents
                            presumably with view to conveying impression Pakistan is becoming more
                            obstreperous as result receiving U.S. arms. India not inclined admit
                            that as the more powerful nation they may have it in their power to
                            reduce the very tension which stimulates their alleged fears of
                            Pakistan, by moving toward settlement Kashmir question.</p>
                        <p>The fear of India regarding potential military action may be
                            unreasonable. Nevertheless the fear is a reality, and cannot be safely
                            ignored. Actually, (a) it is a source of tension between the
                            U.S.—Government of India as well as Government of India—Pakistan, (b) it
                            may engender a new arms race, and offer an opportunity for Russia to
                            enter this area with arms, as it has the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>I make no argument against fulfillment of our original commitments, but I
                            suggest that the knowledge of these factors and the precedent of the
                            situation in the Middle East dictates prudence.</p>

                        <p>It is reported that Pakistan will urge <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> or U.S. separately to support its position on
                            Kashmir. I can only point out that if this is done, it will confirm
                            Indian fears that <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> is not wholly
                            a defensive organization against Russia [but] for political use against

                        <p>If it is urged by Pakistan that statements should be made because of
                            Soviet speeches and tactics in India and Burma, and <gloss

                            interpreted by Government of India that <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> and U.S. have taken sides against India on both
                            Kashmir and <gloss target="#t_GOA1">Goa</gloss>, and of course
                            emphasized if either is mentioned specifically. It does not appear that
                            such statements can be of value to Pakistan and they will do the U.S.
                            incalculable harm in India, repeating the experience of the <gloss

                            directly into Russian plans, and of course make it impossible to discuss

                        <p>I believe strongly, and urge that the U.S. take no step respecting the

                            will have the undoubted effect of further straining U.S.—Government of

                        <p>On March 6, at the second session of the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> Council meeting, Pakistani Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CHH1">Hamidul Haq Chowdhury</persName> brought up the
                            Kashmir dispute. Claiming that the recent statements of Soviet leaders
                            during their visit to Kashmir had brought Pakistan into the East-West
                            cold war, he reasoned that since the Soviet Union had publicly supported
                            India’s claim to Kashmir it was now time for Pakistan’s friends to come
                            out into the open. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> summarized the gist of the Foreign Minister’s
                            remarks: <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0088"/>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“All Pakistan wanted was for people of Kashmir to be allowed to
                                    exercise self-determination and through plebiscite decide
                                    whether they wish to join India or Pakistan. This he said has
                                    been proposed by Security Council and India is committed to it.
                                    If Western democracy were reluctant support Pakistan for fear of
                                    annoying India, friends of West would be dismayed and
                                    demoralized. Failure to support Pakistan would have serious
                                    domestic repercussions in Pakistan, strengthening those opposed
                                    to government’s policy of alliance with West and strengthening
                                    pro-neutralists.”</p>

                            independence of Pakistan had arisen and should be considered by the

                        <p>As Embassy reads Delhi reftel it has unstated premise that India’s
                            intentions to Pakistan are fundamentally pacific and that problem of
                            easing present tensions between two countries is somehow convince
                            Indians that regardless of Pakistani intentions, Pakistani capabilities
                            are and will continue to be too limited to constitute any real threat
                            India. Regardless merits of this assumption, Embassy points out that it
                            is not widely held in Pakistan and present <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                                >GOP</gloss> would react very negatively to any proposal more or
                            less obviously based on it. Pakistanis are in fact, deeply suspicious of
                            Indian bona fides many of them feeling that India not reconciled to
                            existence of independent Pakistan and has from time of partition
                            endeavored isolate Pakistan preparatory absorbing it. Moreover, in view
                            recent militant Indian activity on frontier, coupled with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s repudiation of Kashmir
                            plebiscite commitment, it would be difficult convince Pakistanis that
                            India needs assurance Pakistanis do not threaten Indian security. In
                            point of fact, Pakistan Prime Minister has recently spoken to Ambassador
                            of his serious concern at reports of Indian arms deal with <gloss

                            important offensive weapons on accelerated schedule.</p>
                        <p>We believe these considerations lend further support view stated <gloss
                                target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1947 that it would be unrealistic

                        <p>Embassy considers such course would be very dangerous if not fatal to
                            good US-Pakistani relations. Pakistan intelligence on India extremely
                            effective and Pakistanis undoubtedly receive reports of action of this
                            sort in short order. Even if Indians were disposed respect confidence
                            and keep matter quiet, they would nevertheless have to give report
                            fairly wide official circulation if it is to have desired effect in
                            India. Assuming, on other hand, they wished utilize episode for creating
                            difficulties in US-Pakistani relations and for Baghdad Pact and <gloss

                            enormous.</p>
                        <p>Above considerations seem to Embassy effectively rule out any approach
                            Indians on this subject, including that proposed by British (London
                            reftel), without prior Pakistani knowledge and consent. However, if on

                            to act greater than risk Embassy foresees here as results such action,
                            Embassy believes US might gain some small protection by letting British
                            bear on us, as they seem prepared to do. However, even though US
                            managed, with such dexterity as to be able to deny official complicity
                            when Pakistanis learn of leak, such denial will do little to repair
                            serious damage. Embassy recalls repeated urgent Pakistani requests not

                                >MDAP</gloss> because their conviction British would promptly relay

                            Embassy doubts, effect would be undermine Pakistani confidence in <gloss

                        <p>Sir <persName>Roger</persName> has said that the main purpose of his
                            visit this morning had been to discuss the problem of India and
                            Pakistan. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> and the Indian
                            Government were suffering from grave misapprehensions about the U.S.
                            arming Pakistan. They took the position that it would upset the balance
                            of power between the two countries and perhaps lead the Pakistanis to
                            engage in some sort of “Holy War”…. When Lord Mountbatten had recently
                            visited India, he had been armed with a brief to allay Indian fears. But
                            he had not been successful in allaying Indian apprehensions. In part,
                            Mountbatten felt that his failure in this respect had been due to
                            information from American sources, perhaps attributed to something the
                            Secretary or Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJS1">Cooper</persName>
                            had said to the Indians, during the Secretary’s recent visit to New
                            Delhi.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked Sir <persName>Roger</persName> what he was supposed
                            to have said and Sir <persName>Roger</persName> replied that he did not
                            know and that it was all rather vague. The Secretary pointed out that in
                            his recent visit to India, he had pointed out to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> that we were not embarked on any
                            new arms program for Pakistan, but were simply trying to catch up on
                            deliveries which had fallen far short under our original program. In
                            essence, we were supplying additional equipment to fully equip the 5½
                            Pakistani Divisions. The Secretary said that he had also pointed out to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> that we had no
                            intention of establishing military bases in Pakistan. Furthermore, there
                            were triple provisions that none of the armament which we supplied would
                            be used for aggressive purposes under the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Charter, the provisions of the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> Treaty, and the U.S. bilateral aid agreement with
                            Pakistan. The Secretary further pointed out that the U.S. in signing the
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Treaty had entered a
                            reservation that it would only come into force in the event of Communist
                            aggression since we did not wish to be brought into disputes between
                            countries in the area with which we had friendly relations. Finally, the
                            Secretary pointed out to <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0097"/>Sir
                                <persName>Roger</persName> that in his press conference in New Delhi
                            he had made it quite clear that if contrary to all expectations Pakistan
                            committed aggression against India, the U.S. would be on the side of the
                            country against which the aggression had been committed. This had not
                            gone down well in Pakistan but had been specifically designed to make
                            clear to the Indians the position of the U.S.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we had contemplated giving the Indians directly
                            information regarding our arms shipments to Pakistan but we had dropped
                            this idea as a result of the strong recommendation against it by our
                            Embassy in Pakistan which feared that the Pakistanis would react badly
                            if we did so. The Secretary added that there seemed to be a split on
                            this question in the Pakistan Government and that while some people in
                            the Foreign Office favored informing the Indians on the scope of the
                            Pakistan defense program on a reciprocal basis, the Pakistan Government
                            as a whole seemed to be against it…. The Secretary said that any
                            discussions the British had with the Indians looking to allaying their
                            fears should be bilateral rather than in the forum of the Commonwealth
                            Conference so as to avoid creating additional problems with the
                            Pakistanis….</p>

                            bombers would be required to keep Pakistan ratio strength up to level of
                            1 to 3 and went on to say if <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> argued
                            for 3 to 1 ratio it could not be because of any fear complex in Indian

                            in terms of defense against Pakistan. Ratio of 1 to 1 should be enough
                            for defense purposes as the country on defensive had certain, obvious

                                    in light of the unstable political situation in Pakistan. Nor
                                    did it wish to give the Pakistanis cause for alleging that the

                            statements however we have avoided entering into merits case and have
                            made clear our hope for early settlement either through <gloss

                        <p>I believe Paks can be in no doubt that my March 7 statement, made in
                            closed <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> session, was not intended
                            exclude alternative means achieve settlement. In talking to press in

                            Paks would wish make it appear that our “commitment” to “support” their
                            side of case against India is a firm one.</p>
                        <p>In view our primary concern peaceful settlement acceptable both sides,
                            and since unlikely any action Security Council could take would
                            accomplish what Paks desire, it is in our interest avoid insofar as
                            possible playing leading role which would incur wrath both sides. We
                            should continue coordinate closely with <gloss target="#t_UK1"

                            regarding Kashmir.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister of Pakistan is now making effective his public
                            advocacy of Pakistan’s case in London; an extract from his speech of
                            June 25th is attached to this despatch.<note n="2" xml:id="d29fn2">Not
                                printed. The speech, which strongly advocated self-determination for
                                the people of Kashmir, was delivered during the Commonwealth
                                Conference in London.</note></p>
                        <p>The Embassy is satisfied that the depth of feeling, at least in West
                            Pakistan, regarding what Pakistanis consider the injustice of <pb n="87"
                                xml:id="pg_87" facs="0109"/>the present situation calls for a
                            continued appraisal of U.S. policies in relation to the Kashmir issue.
                            These policies affect our relations with Pakistan, with India and with
                            the United Nations. This despatch is an attempt to evaluate recent
                            expressions of Pakistani leaders, most of which have been the subject of
                            piecemeal reporting from time to time in cables, memoranda of
                            conversation and despatches. The June 25th speech of Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_ACM1">Ali</persName> will probably remain the
                            classic statement of the case.</p>
                        <p>It is certainly our impression in Karachi that feelings run deep both
                            among the articulate public and in government circles insofar as Kashmir
                            is concerned. Pakistanis feel that the basic understanding at the time
                            of partition was that contiguous territories would be divided between
                            India and Pakistan pursuant to the wishes of the majority of their
                            populations, that Kashmir was predominantly Muslim, and that the legal
                            devices used by the Hindu rulers of India and Lord Mountbatten in
                            wresting the Kashmiris from Pakistan, however sound they may have been
                            technically, were morally wrong. Furthermore, the arrest of Sheikh
                                Abdullah<note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3">Prime Minister of the State of
                                Jammu and Kashmir, 1948–1953.</note> and other oppressive measures
                            taken in Kashmir by the Government of India are proof of the injustice
                            of India’s case and indicative of the Indians’ ambition, under <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s guidance, to dominate for the
                            sake of domination. Pakistanis cite the case as yet another instance
                            where the United Nations has proved to be an instrument of futility.
                            They are convinced that the Muslims, at least in the Vale of Kashmir,
                            wish to be free of Hindu domination and to become aligned with
                            Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>Pakistani actions in the last few months in handling the Kashmir case,
                            however, are equally indicative of the lack of effectiveness of the
                            Government of Pakistan and the disunity of its top leadership. November
                            witnessed a gathering from throughout West Pakistan of various leaders,
                            described as an All-Parties Kashmir Conference. This gathering was
                            supposed to provide the necessary popular support for a strong line of
                            action to be taken by the Government. Three successive courses of action
                            were mapped out. First there were to be private talks with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>; failing a favorable result of
                            these talks, an approach to the United Nations; and failing action by
                            the United Nations, the threat of a mass movement among the tribes and
                            the Muslim population of Kashmir, a satyagraha.</p>
                        <p>Talks with <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> have not taken
                            place and have been frustrated by announcements made by <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> and his colleagues. As far as the
                            United Nations is concerned, the Government of Pakistan is still
                            floundering about trying to find a leader for its delegation to the
                            Security Council who can effectively present Pakistan’s case. The last
                            two months have witnessed fruitless efforts by the Government <pb n="88"
                                xml:id="pg_88" facs="0110"/>of Pakistan to find such a qualified
                            person. In the meantime, U.S. interests have certainly not been improved
                            here as a result of our expressed wishes to postpone presentation of the
                            case to the Security Council, and our unwillingness to advocate positive
                            support for Pakistan’s demands for a plebiscite in the Security Council.
                            At the moment, our tactics appear unfortunate as our lukewarm attitude
                            has not helped us here, while Pakistan’s own default has been such as to
                            foreclose action in the Security Council during the spring or early
                            summer of 1956. With the prospects of further political turmoil in this
                            country in the late summer of 1956, it is quite likely that Pakistan
                            will find it still more difficult to recruit a satisfactory team for
                            presentation of the Kashmir case in the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>Pakistanis are equally vague on plans to administer the state of Kashmir
                            if it were detached from India through action of the United Nations.
                            There is no plan for the taking over of administrative functions, and
                            little thought has been given to the relationship of the areas that
                            might be annexed to Pakistan in the constitutional structure of
                            Pakistan. Queries by Embassy officers as to what Pakistan would do if a
                            plebiscite resulted in Kashmir’s annexation to Pakistan bring either a
                            shrug of the shoulders or a statement to the effect that at the time of
                            partition there were no plans for operating Pakistan, but it was
                            operated; and the same outcome might be anticipated if Kashmir opted to
                            join the Republic.<note n="4" xml:id="d29fn4">See Clause 203 of the

                        <p>I was recently asked to see Secretary of the Cabinet, Mr. Aziz Ahmed, on
                            this subject. Mr. Ahmed considers this issue far and away the most
                            important one facing any government of Pakistan, and is convinced that
                            Pakistan’s foreign policy has been and will continue to be guided
                            primarily by this consideration: “Will our proposed action help solve
                            Kashmir?” Mr. Ahmed told me that in 1953 <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> had returned from the Commonwealth Conference in
                            London to India via Karachi. When he reached Karachi he had been
                            obviously impressed by the warmth of feeling shown by the Pakistani
                            crowds toward him as a great Asian leader. Moved by this manifestation,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> had expressed in
                            correspondence with Pakistan’s Prime Minister his willingness to solve
                            the Kashmir problem by a plebiscite, and working level teams
                            representing Pakistan and India met to discuss ways and means of
                            carrying out this undertaking. The Pakistanis believe that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> felt that by a concession of this
                            nature to Pakistan, he could extend his influence over the entire
                            subcontinent and gain a position of dominant leadership over both wings
                            of Pakistan. That would have enabled him to move toward achieving his
                            ambition of being recognized as the unchallenged leader of all of
                            Asia.</p>
                        <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0111"/>
                        <p>The plans, however, for a bilateral solution of the question failed when
                            rumors of substantial American assistance to Pakistan were broadcast in
                            the autumn. Mr. Ahmed referred specifically to an editorial in the New
                            York Times which upset <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>
                            thoroughly and frustrated the operation of the working level teams. This
                            editorial considered the possibility that with American military
                            assistance, a Pakistani army of no less than 1,000,000 men would be
                            activated. With such a prospect, <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> saw that his role as leader of Asia was
                            challenged. Subsequently, the establishment of large scale military and
                            economic assistance programs to Pakistan have rendered impossible any
                            concessions by the vain and ambitious <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> is,
                            therefore, sincere when he says that India’s position with regard to
                            Kashmir has been altered by Pakistan’s acceptance of large-scale
                            assistance from the United States. While such a position appears
                            illogical and irrational to the outsider, what <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> is really saying is that if the
                            Pakistanis and Americans make it impossible for me to achieve my destiny
                            as the dominant force on the subcontinent and throughout South and South
                            East Asia, I will not agree to a Kashmir plebiscite. The Kashmir
                            plebiscite is in my power, but is to be used only in consideration for
                            achieving my own personal ends. Such is the reading of Mr. Ahmed, an
                            exceptionally well informed Pakistani.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has been made well aware of the very considerable propaganda
                            from the Government of India which rationalizes India’s current position
                            on Kashmir along other lines. For example, India treats its Muslim
                            population well. The result of a plebiscite in Kashmir would cause a
                            chain reaction among the 43,000,000 Muslims living throughout India, and
                            cause a revival of communalism in its worst forms. India has a sound
                            legal case in Kashmir and the Kashmiris and Pakistanis were guilty of
                            aggression. This is nobody’s business but India’s and Pakistan’s. It is
                            purely a family quarrel. (The Indians undoubtedly think that the big
                            brother could take good care of little brother if people outside did not
                            interfere.)</p>
                        <p>The Department will note that in a recent conversation with the
                            Ambassador, the Prime Minister of Pakistan indicated his willingness for
                            a compromise settlement with predominantly Hindu areas of Jammu and
                            Kashmir being permitted to remain with India, but with those territories
                            presently occupied by Pakistan, including the predominantly Muslim Vale,
                            becoming an integral part of Pakistan. At the right time and in the
                            right setting, Pakistanis would accept, in all probability, a solution
                            along these lines, which would fit both ethnological and geographical
                            factors.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister has also on more than one occasion expressed his
                            concern lest the case, which prima facie looks a just one, and a case
                            which rightly should be solved through the United Nations, be allowed to
                            be lost by default through fears in the West <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90"
                                facs="0112"/>of antagonizing <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName>. This would have the secondary effect of
                            aggrandizing <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s reputation
                            while perpetuating the injustice of Kashmir.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy hopes that the Department will treat this case on its merits:
                            a dispute in which the inhabitants of Kashmir are primarily concerned,
                            and one where justice demands that their wishes be consulted under
                            conditions where a fair and free expression of the public will can be
                            had. Failing such a solution, the prestige of the United States and of
                            the United Nations is bound to suffer irreparably. Kashmir, like
                            Palestine, will remain a deadly cancer.</p>

                            to the Pakistanis about procedure that we scrupulously avoid any
                            comments that might lead Pakistan to believe that we would support them
                            in the event the matter does come before the Council. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> assured me that he
                            would not deviate from our instructions so much as “one inch”. I replied
                            that I would prefer that he not deviate even “one-half inch”. He pointed
                            out that he had discussed with the Pakistan representative, at the
                            latter’s request, certain methods of procedure, but that he did not
                            believe that any suggestions he made could in any way be interpreted as
                            supporting Pakistan on the substance of the issue. He further expressed
                            the view that he often found it useful to discuss matters of tactics
                            with friendly delegations if they <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0113"
                            />so desired, even if the U.S. later voted against the position of the
                            state with whom tactics were discussed. In any event, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> assured me that he
                            would conduct any further discussions on this subject with the utmost
                            discretion. He further expressed his appreciation to me for having
                            called him about the matter.</p>

                            telegram which had been drafted for my signature. The idea of discussing
                            this matter over the telephone instead of handling it by telegram had

                            that they have not yet made up their minds what it is that they expect
                            to ask us to support. We can hardly give them a blank check in advance
                            to support anything they may subsequently decide to come up with.</p>
                        <p>Your despatch is most useful in summarizing the Pakistani viewpoint. I
                            wish it might have been possible to make a more specific recommendation
                            for action on our part, beyond the hope <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92"
                                facs="0114"/>that the Department will “treat this case on its
                            merits”—which we have certainly been trying to do since the dispute
                            arose in 1947.</p>
                        <p>You do suggest that the Pakistanis would in all probability accept a
                            compromise settlement which would leave predominantly Hindu areas with
                            India, “but with those territories presently occupied by Pakistan,
                            including the predominantly Muslim Vale, becoming an integral part of
                            Pakistan.” The “predominantly Muslim Vale” is, of course, presently
                            occupied by India and it is not clear how any group of outside powers
                            could go about persuading India to give up “the heart” of Kashmir.</p>
                        <p>You may be sure that we appreciate the strong feelings of the Pakistanis
                            on the Kashmir controversy and their tendency to measure the success of
                            their over-all foreign policy by the progress they make on Kashmir. We
                            certainly desire to find a settlement of this running sore in the
                            relations between these two countries. To remove it, however, the
                            “solution” must be one that is mutually and genuinely accepted by both
                            sides; if it is not, we have accomplished nothing, even if a majority of
                            the Security Council could be mustered to accept in toto Pakistan’s
                            version of the controversy (which is doubtful), and the Security Council
                            possessed the means of enforcing such a decision in an area occupied by
                            Indian troops (which it does not). In company with the British, we have
                            therefore preferred to follow courses of action which seemed most likely
                            of resulting in agreement between the parties. Simple support in the
                            debate for the case of one side or the other would not advance that
                            solution any more than the Soviets advanced it by plunking for India’s
                            side last December. And since even all-out support on our part for
                            Pakistan’s case could not bring about the desired solution, the
                            Pakistanis would be more frustrated and resentful than ever, while we
                            should have been put in a position of leading a major campaign against
                            India which would be certain to have consequences of the utmost
                            gravity.</p>
                        <p>I do not understand the statement in your despatch that U.S. interests
                            have not been improved there “as a result of our expressed wishes to
                            postpone presentation of the case to the Security Council, and our
                            unwillingness to advocate positive support for Pakistan’s demands for a
                            plebiscite in the Security Council.” It was my understanding that the
                            Pakistanis had not themselves been prepared to bring the case to the
                            Security Council until after the Commonwealth Conference, which suited
                            our convenience because of the prospective <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> visit. In response to their request for <hi

                            they would probably do better in January than sooner, but the only
                            position given to the Pakistanis has been that set forth in the last <pb
                                n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0115"/>paragraph of the Department’s

                            (repeated to Karachi 2926). Nor has Pakistan yet formulated her demand
                            to the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>It is natural that the Pakistanis should bring continuing pressure to
                            bear on us for support in this case when it eventually comes before the
                            Security Council. In the meantime, however, we must retain the greatest
                            possible operating flexibility. We shall try to take a stand that is
                            fair and consistent with our previous declarations on the matter, but we
                            shall not always be able to give them everything they want—and probably
                            they do not expect us to. We can certainly assure them of a sympathetic
                            hearing at any time, and of the desire to be helpful in any way likely
                            to advance a genuine solution. We have already reassured them that we
                            considered the <gloss target="#t_UNCIP1">UNCIP</gloss> Resolutions still
                            valid, which is in effect an action in their favor. It is, incidentally,
                            more than a little ironic to hear responsible officials seemingly
                            supporting <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s claim that the
                            Kashmir situation has been altered by the fact of U.S. aid to Pakistan,
                            and by implication placing blame on the U.S. for having impeded the
                            holding of a plebiscite. You do not report your reply to this offensive
                            reasoning, but I assume you gave him a firm answer on that one!</p>
                        <p>In closing I want to mention that both the British and the Australians
                            have told us of reports they had received from Karachi to the effect
                            that the U.S. Embassy had informed the Pakistani Government on July 4
                            that we were prepared to support them on Kashmir in the Security Council
                            whenever they wanted to introduce the item. Both the <gloss

                                might be separated into various segments, justified ethnologically
                                and topographically, for the purpose of holding more than one

                            and Pakistan frustration at inability over 7 years to obtain plebiscite.
                            But we are unable in light of paragraphs number 2–4 above to see that
                            anything constructive will be achieved by another debate now on subject,
                            which is more than usually unpromising of concrete results and likely to
                            produce acrimony. Highly unlikely <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            would make any concessions during forthcoming general election campaign
                            and likely it would feel impelled to take strong nationalistic line.

                        <p>(6) Under present circumstances Embassy believes most feasible position
                            for US is general one outlined by Secretary in <gloss
                                target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 689 June 8 to <gloss
                                target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>. In Delhi it appears that in long run
                            any workable solution Kashmir issue must come through agreement between
                            India and Pakistan and entail <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> not
                            relinquishing what it now holds. If <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                            can find way to live politically with this disappointment (we do not
                            know that it can) it may obtain thereby highly beneficial <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> concessions in return. Fact that
                            currently series conferences being held in Karachi and New Delhi between
                            officials two governments to work out several problems, including
                            financial matters and use of waters, gives some hope that eventually two
                            countries may be able reach agreement even on Kashmir. In such event
                            basic US interests would be served without US having take position
                            merits, which we have so far avoided. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> is still receptive to making “deal” on basis
                            cease-fire line proposal. A deal on Kashmir and other Indo-Pakistan
                            issues would make good ammunition for Congress Party for upcoming
                            elections. Among the bargaining counters which could be developed to
                            benefit of both sides are: guarantee to Pakistan for uninterrupted and
                            adequate water supplies originating in India and Kashmir; India
                            undertaking along lines already developed to assist Pakistan in
                            financing development of “belt canals”; and formula for insulating
                            border areas in Kashmir between armed forces of India and Pakistan with
                            provisions for progressive reduction of troops.</p>
                        <p>(7) Embassy realizes that US must support holding another <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> discussion of Kashmir if proposed by
                            Pakistan or any other member. But in view negative prospects, we would
                            hope it could be done with as little fanfare as possible. Although
                            existing <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions on subject should
                            in our opinion be reaffirmed, as representing gain obtained by <gloss

                            disputes, door should of course be left open for continued bilateral

                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> position.</p>
                        <p>To sum up: no pressure we can see short of war will force <gloss

                                >GOP</gloss> is only source competent to judge whether it can
                            justify such deal to Pakistan public. In long run perhaps circumstances
                            will wear down resistance both India and Pakistan to point where they
                            will agree directly. In meanwhile we hope US will be able avoid becoming
                            more involved in issue which can only earn us further criticism from all
                            sides.</p>

                        <p>The Foreign Minister expressed concern over the sale of 60 Canberra
                            bombers and 300 Centurion tanks to India and stated he had discussed
                            this with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> who
                            tried to reassure him by saying that deliveries of these items would be
                            spread over a period of years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> replied it was his
                            understanding that one factor in the decision of Britain to sell this
                            type of military equipment to India had been the definite probability
                            that India would have obtained them from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> if they were not made available from free-world
                            sources. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMFK1">Noon</persName> remarked that
                            American aid to India saved India’s foreign exchange which in turn was
                            used to buy arms from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> or <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and that in case of war Pakistan
                            would stand four-square with the US and that India on the other hand
                            will “attack Pakistan and there go your friends.” Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> replied that for many years the
                            US has been friends with both India and Pakistan, that war between India
                            and Pakistan would be most unfortunate and that US policy with respect
                            to both countries was designed to facilitate better relations between
                            the two.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister referred to Pakistan’s difficulties with India over
                            Kashmir and the Canal Waters dispute and expressed the hope that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> would be
                            able to discuss these matters with <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> during the latter’s visit to the United

                            expressed his Government’s concern that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> while in the US would endeavor to undermine US
                            military aid to Pakistan by offering to reduce India’s military
                            expenditures if the US curtailed military aid to Pakistan. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NMFK1">Noon</persName> urged that the US reply to Mr.

                            that he permit a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> plebiscite in Kashmir

                            a permanent peace treaty with you.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> in replying to the
                            Foreign Minister’s earlier reference to US aid to India and neutralist
                            countries: (a) Cited our extensive aid to countries with whom we have
                            special ties such as Turkey, Greece, Iran and Pakistan; (b) added that
                            there was a great deal of misunderstanding on the scope of our aid to
                            committed vs. non-committed countries; (c) stated that our aid programs
                            for Pakistan were larger than for India.</p>

                            Pakistan’s high officials. He was worried over the situation because of
                            Pakistan’s internal political instability and the possibility that, to
                            divert attention from the domestic political and economic situation,
                            Pakistan might undertake some foolish adventure. The Secretary said that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s remarks were
                            comparable to his estimate that the Soviet Union might undertake some
                            reckless foreign adventure as a result of its internal troubles.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if it were true that the economic situation in East
                            Pakistan was particularly bad and the Prime Minister said he believed
                            so. He said India’s great worry in that area was the refugee problem.
                            Some 4 million refugees have crossed into West Bengal from East Bengal
                            in the past few years. Even today 25 to 30 thousand refugees come into
                            West Bengal each month. The principal difficulty was India’s inability
                            to resettle these refugees in parts of India other than Bengal. Due to
                            their language and for other reasons these refugees when sent to places
                            provided for them would invariably return to Bengal.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that there were some Muslims among the refugees
                            but that most of them were Hindu. He attributed the exodus to lack of
                            confidence and economic problems. He said he would not say that the
                            Government of Pakistan was behind the <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101"
                                facs="0123"/>exodus but he believed that petty officials were saying
                            things about the position of the minority that destroyed the Hindus’
                            confidence. He remarked that the Government of India has recently
                            discovered that about 90 percent of the migration certificates required
                            of the refugees had been forged.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled his press conference in New Delhi last Spring in
                            which he said that the United States would be on the side of India in
                            case of aggression by Pakistan. That position is still held. He added
                            that his statement had not been received with universal satisfaction.
                            The U.S. was trying to live by principle. This always led to
                            unpopularity in a nation or an individual. Another person or country
                            wants you to be on its side, as a matter of sentimental attachment,
                            whatever it does. In this connection the Secretary referred to a passage
                            in <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">George</persName> Washington’s farewell
                            address. The Prime Minister agreed and remarked that this was a human
                            failing. The Secretary said that we have emphasized in the past and will
                            continue to stress to the Pakistanis that the arms we are furnishing
                            them are under our agreements to be used only for defense.</p>

                            dispute. Immediately following their talk, the President telephoned

                            Bernau, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ secretary,
                            summarizes the discussion relating to Kashmir: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“He [<persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>] said the
                                    Pakistan newspapers have one slogan—fight India. The Pres. said
                                    if any nation to whom we give arms uses them aggressively we
                                    would oppose them—not go to war but exert other pressures. N.
                                    said he knows it but they have only one cry. Our newspapers are
                                    filled with the five-year plan and they have come to accept the
                                    existence of Pakistan and difficulties and they have four
                                    problems which he described and they think they can be solved.
                                    He asked us to get them to stop the propaganda and threats. The
                                    Pres. said we are against it but don’t know how we do it.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> said the papers
                                    frighten the people. The Pres. said something (I’m not sure of)
                                    re maybe their purposes are pure but do the people believe what
                                    you say.” (Memorandum of telephone conversation, December 19;

                                    avoided, if possible, on basis subsequent agreement on principle
                                    of plebiscite. This is unlikely, however, as Indians will
                                    undoubtedly rest large part their case on “aggression”. As
                                        <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> has never accepted
                                    “aggression” argument of India and as factual situation
                                    surrounding period was quite complex it should be possible to
                                    make satisfactory reply which will not simply brush off Indian

                                    on plebiscite to nullify it, laying heavy emphasis on Pakistan’s
                                    participation in military pacts and on US aid. We should be
                                    fully prepared to meet this contention.</p>

                                    question. If this constitution goes into effect with approval

                                    distressed to learn (Comment: Certainly from sources other than

                                    Pakistan would be outraged by such a proposal and would consider
                                    US support of such proposal as an outright betrayal of <gloss

                                        >GOP</gloss> and public as result of <persName
                                        corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s visit. Anything less
                                    than staunch reaffirmation of support of plebiscite would be
                                    shattering to Pakistani-US relations. If support of plebiscite
                                    reaffirmed and made clear that any group coming to Kashmir was
                                    to recommend steps for implementing plebiscite this would be
                                    acceptable though Pakistani preference set forth in (1) above.
                                    If US support not consistent with this paragraph, Prime Minister
                                    “would not dare show his face”. Prime Minister said public would
                                    say “you have put all your faith in <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                        >USG</gloss> and now they are going back on their support.”
                                    I felt Prime Minister implied this would affect whole foreign

                                    called on me yesterday afternoon to discuss Pakistani case on
                                    Kashmir. He reviewed Pakistani position on historical origins of
                                    situation, laying entire blame on India and <gloss
                                        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, especially Mountbatten. The most
                                    important substantive points he made are reported below:</p>
                                <p><persName corresp="#p_SHS1">Suhrawardy</persName> and himself had
                                    fully committed themselves to Free World and would stand or fall
                                    on basis this firm Pakistani alignment. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_NMFK1">Khan Noon</persName> said he would resign
                                    if US did not give Pakistan firm support on Kashmir issue. He
                                    said he had not told this to anyone else. He pointed out that
                                        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had had responsibility for
                                    seeking some solution for Kashmir problem for 9 years and that
                                    Pakistan had been put off during this entire period of time
                                    without any definitive action. There could be no peace between
                                    India and Pakistan, and hence none in southern Asia until
                                    Kashmir situation settled. Pakistani population was very much
                                    excited over problem and this was last chance for positive
                                    action by <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. Nominal action
                                    would not suffice. He could not predict what might happen with
                                    Pakistani population if <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> again
                                    failed them. He said reaction would not necessarily be against
                                    US because Pakistanis would continue to be grateful for US aid
                                    and support, but it might mean a move toward a non-alignment and
                                    better relations with Communist China and the <gloss

                                <p>There was considerable leftist sentiment in Pakistan against firm
                                    policy of Pakistani leaders in alignment with West. There were

                                    be better treated than those who were committed. Failure of

                                    said Pakistan wanted two actions—an order from <gloss

                                    that troops would be available for <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                                    Jordan, and that forces from such states should be acceptable
                                    politically to India as well as to Pakistan. If India unwilling
                                    to allow <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces into its part
                                    of occupied Kashmir, Pakistanis would still be prepared to admit
                                    forces on their side of line as replacement for Pakistani
                                    troops. We suggested that before going on with idea they check
                                    with other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members on their
                                    willingness to provide troops for such forces. <persName

                                    touchy and bellicose attitude throughout conversation. He
                                    referred to possibility of Kashmir settlement by force, to
                                    superiority of Moslems over Hindus as fighting people, and to
                                    Hindu haste in making compromises and concessions when they felt
                                    pressure was sufficiently determined. He said that if <gloss

                                    force to Kashmir, as it had been to Near East, Indians would
                                    fold up quickly. If Indians would not accept <gloss
                                        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces, he said, give us a few

                                    will push Indians out. These comments reported as reflection of
                                    belligerency of his attitude rather than an indication of
                                    intent, as he stressed Pakistan did not have power not [<hi

                                            important security considerations arose about Ladakh
                                            which had indicated it would never agree to go to
                                            Pakistan as result general plebiscite and would secede
                                            to Tibet and to Communist China. This might result in
                                            other Buddhist areas in northern India wanting to
                                            secede, and would move Communist China strategically

                                            reiteration previous resolutions and inquired about
                                            Indian attitude on that, Lall said he thought it would
                                            be better not to do this but did not react strongly.
                                            Lall also indicated that India would probably want few

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> thought best action for

                            action. He hoped there would be only general round of discussions
                            presenting views on various sides and that no member <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> would present resolution. He said India
                            could not accept any resolution <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> might
                            adopt and thought that less question was stirred up the better. He said
                            Kashmir was not coming before <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> as
                            result anything India had done but probably stemmed from necessity weak
                            Pakistani Govt to seek external emotional issue to bolster its position.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said India had thought
                            of introducing second item into <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            focusing on Pakistan aggression but had decided this would be <pb

                            course make aggression case in his speech.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said India was not prepared
                            to give up any of its legal position on Kashmir. Entire state had
                            acceded formally to India in proper form provided for at time partition
                            by agreement between <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, India and
                            Pakistan. Indian constitution, like US, had no provision for secession
                            and there was no possibility India allowing this to happen.</p>
                        <p>If Kashmir were allowed to secede this might disrupt unity of Indian
                            state inasmuch as over 500 other states and principalities had acceded
                            to India in same fashion as Kashmir. India’s legal position pertained to
                            entire state and meant that Pakistan should withdraw from areas they
                            illegally control as result aggression. However, India had no military
                            intentions re areas they did not control. On other hand, if Pakistanis
                            by some miscalculation attacked Indian-held areas of Kashmir, India
                            would have to defend itself and would then feel released from its
                            undertaking not to attempt to take Pakistan-held areas by force. Lall
                            (India) added that in such circumstances India might have to go through
                            Punjab as this was natural military approach to Kashmir. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said best indication of lack
                            Indian military intentions was fact it had done nothing about East
                            Bengal and <gloss target="#t_GOA1">Goa</gloss>. He said East Bengal
                            would fall to India if India blew hard and <gloss target="#t_GOA1"
                                >Goa</gloss> could be taken by six policemen.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said Indian position was
                            based on two fundamental points—its legal position on Kashmir accession
                            and problem military security. He said he obviously could not make
                            public argument on various security aspects related to Kashmir. India
                            was concerned about stability of Pakistan Govt. There was much leftist
                            tendency in Pakistan and Moslems were very susceptible to Communist
                            doctrines. Pakistan had conservative leftist govt now, but it was
                            questionable how long it would last. Next year govt might be leftist and
                            following year Communist. This would cause great concern in India and
                            India had to take special precautions for its security. He reiterated
                            arguments on possibility of Ladakh going to Tibet (see <gloss

                            and similar argument about Baluchistan. He said Moslems in Baluchistan
                            were more similar to Moslems of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            than those of Pakistan and said that British had never been able to
                            govern northwest provinces adequately and neither would Pakistanis.</p>
                        <p>On plebiscite <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said that if
                            India were ever foolish enough to agree it would produce communal riots
                            in India and upset Indian efforts to be secular state. He also stressed
                            great economic progress made in Kashmir, number of visitors there every
                            year, and extent to which it has been economically integrated into
                            India.</p>
                        <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0134"/>
                        <p>He also referred to fact that military aid to Pakistan had changed
                            balance between India and Pakistan which had been at 5–2 ratio at
                            partition. This altered security position had to be taken into
                            consideration by India. He said he did not mean US had intended to arm
                            Pakistan against India, but that Pakistan had accepted US military aid
                            in order strengthen itself against India. He said Indian position would
                            be clear on this in debate. He mentioned fact that center Pakistan power
                            was closer to Kashmir than was that of India and that buildup Pakistan
                            Air Force with American help augmented Pakistan’s strategic position. He
                            also referred to airport in Gilgit which he or Lall said was used by
                            American planes on way to Asia.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> also said India was not
                            anxious to rely on Soviet veto in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> for
                            protection. With internal elections coming in India shortly, Communist
                            Party would utilize such veto as electioneering weapon to persuade
                            voters of strength Soviet support of India. Congress Party would not
                            like to see this happen. Neither were they anxious to have such result
                            in view their international position. However, it would be difficult for
                            them to reject support on issue on which they thought they were
                            right.</p>

                                incorporation of Kashmir on January 26, in the absence of the
                                Council’s concurrence or agreement between Pakistan and India, was
                                inconsistent with the Security Council resolution of March 30, 1951.

                            necessary to reiterate previous resolutions. We asked if <persName

                            procedure which might open up new approaches on Kashmir such as another

                            he worked under strict instructions on this question and would report

                            to Commission members when they asked to come to India. If <gloss

                            some other capacity. I said I thought it unlikely they would see another
                            American coming out on this question. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> said they could hardly accept someone like a Latin

                            we were not really thinking about Latin Americans. (Today Lall inquired
                            whether we could advise UNRep as to kind of report he might make. We
                            replied we certainly could not. But if India felt its case was as good
                            as they said, they would undoubtedly have no fear of reports he might

                        <p>The Pres wanted to make sure that 10 tomorrow was all right for them to
                            talk, and the Sec said fine.</p>
                        <p>The Sec mentioned Kashmir—we are trying to take a moderate course that
                            will probably not please either side. The Sec wondered how close the
                            Pres wanted to keep to it. The Pres mentioned when <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> was here he forgot India blocked
                            the plebiscite and said N’s understanding is the Pakistan <gloss
                                target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> stated he himself was ready to accept the
                            existing lines but that he could not say it. If the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> came along and adopted it they would
                            adopt it. The Pres said what is in the papers makes this not true. It
                            may have been he hoped we would press for that. The Pres does not know
                            whether we can keep hands off. The Sec said his theory is they would be
                            swayed by religious appeals and not vote their political convictions.
                            The Sec said the Indians took steps to integrate on the 26th of Jan the
                            whole business. The Pres said Pakistan had ? of the territory and ¼ of
                            the population and were willing to see that go into Pakistan (India?)
                            holdings. This would violate the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> res.
                            We are working with the British on a resolution and the Sec referred to
                            the substance of it. The Pres said <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> weakens his case badly but he is insistent on one
                            thing—if they build the boundaries along religious lines, he is in a
                            hole. There is some justice on <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName>’s side that does not appear on the surface. The
                            Sec agreed but the trouble is that the Pakis think <pb n="118"
                                xml:id="pg_118" facs="0140"/>that position strikes at the existence
                            of Pakistan—they are trying to undo Pakistan. The Pres mentioned the
                            Sec’s writing to <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> whatever
                            the attitude we take and saying he felt this was the best way not to
                            worsen the situation and he talked with the Pres about it. He recognizes
                            his difficulties and knows there are elements of justice which do not
                            appear in the record. We are concerned re the situation.<note n="2"

                                    have just been talking together about the Kashmir matter now
                                    before the Security Council. We are, as you know, distressed
                                    that there should be this sharp dispute between two of our good
                                    friends. Also it is not easy to determine our course because of
                                    the cross-currents, some religious and some political.</p>
                                <p>You will, however, we are confident, understand that, as a
                                    minimum, we cannot disregard the prior decisions of the United

                                    concerned agree on some other solution. Also we do not see how
                                    the Security Council can be silent in the face of any
                                    development which might gravely disturb the situation contrary
                                    to United Nations decisions.</p>

                                    we hope will be considered moderate and generally acceptable.
                                    The President and I, however, did not want you to feel that we
                                    were unmindful of your great personal preoccupation with this

                        <p>On January 24, 1957, the United Nations Security Council adopted a draft
                            resolution regarding the Kashmir dispute sponsored by Australia,
                            Colombia, Cuba, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The
                            resolution, adopted by a 10 to 0 vote with 1 abstention (the Soviet
                            Union), recalled previous resolutions of both the Council and the United
                            Nations Commission for India and Pakistan concerning Kashmir, all of
                            which had declared that the future disposition of the State of Jammu and
                            Kashmir would be made in accordance with the will of the people
                            expressed through the democratic method of a free and impartial
                            plebiscite conducted under the auspices of the United Nations. It stated
                            further that the convening of a Constituent Assembly and any action
                            which it might have taken or might attempt to take to determine the
                            future shape and affiliation of Kashmir would be inconsistent with the
                            principles expressed in those resolutions. (<gloss target="#t_UN1"

                            was due to poor handling of case by his predecessors and that his long

                            there was no provision for secession of Kashmir from India.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said there was danger of
                            some type of “fedayeen” attacks by Pakistanis along Kashmir border.
                            India could not safely allow these attacks to penetrate sufficiently
                            deep to demonstrate their aggressive character before launching military
                            resistance. They would have to resist immediately any military moves by
                            Pakistanis. This might result in Pakistani claims of Indian attacks
                            against Pakistan, and he hoped we would not be fooled. <persName

                            India would take over Pakistan. They would do this in spite of American
                            planes in Pakistan. He said Indian ground forces could easily defeat
                            Pakistani troops, who, he thought, lacked will to fight.</p>
                        <p>He said India should take both East Bengal and West Pakistan. He stressed
                            most of Pakistan’s foreign exchange earnings came from East Bengal and
                            implied that their loss would prevent Pakistan from acquiring outside
                            military supplies. He also noted that East Bengal economic situation was
                            very difficult and that India had had to donate relief supplies for East
                            Bengal on two or three occasions.</p>
                        <p>He reiterated that he did not mean that we had supplied arms to Pakistan
                            for use against India, but added that when you give a child a knife it
                            is not for purpose of sticking someone, but it might be hard to prevent
                            him from doing so. He added that even if US opposed Pakistani military
                            aggression and was willing to go to war, any action US might take would
                            probably be too late to help India.</p>

                            <item>After a lengthy presentation of India’s case on Kashmir on 23–24
                                January, the Security Council approved a resolution which reminded
                                the governments concerned of the principle embodied in previous
                                resolutions that the final disposition of Kashmir be made in
                                accordance with the will of the people. The vote was 10–0 with the

                                before the vote that a Soviet veto was not desired because India did
                                not want to appear to be under Soviet umbrella. <persName

                            <item>The U.S. position throughout has been one of cautious support of
                                Pakistan through a solution based upon <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >U.N.</gloss> resolutions, unless the parties themselves could
                                agree to a solution through direct negotiations. The U.S. attitude
                                is dictated by the fear of damaging U.S.-Indian relations which were
                                somewhat improved after <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"

                                has been tarnished by his attitude and actions, but he will retain
                                his influence in the Afro-Asian Bloc. It is interesting to note that
                                the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> representatives of Ceylon,
                                Indonesia, and Burma all have commented upon the weakness of the
                                Indian position. The Bandung powers may offer their “good offices”

                            <item>India’s immediate courses of action are aimed at gaining time. For
                                the short run they are trying to stall until after the forthcoming
                                elections. A part of the pressure being applied to the U.S. by India
                                is the forecast of Communist gains if <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >U.N.</gloss> action adverse to India is taken before elections.
                                Another pressure for delay is the thinly <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124"
                                    facs="0146"/>veiled threat of another “blood-bath” to the Moslem
                                minority remaining in India. Also, <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                    >Nehru</persName> would like to prevent any action until after
                                the General Assembly adjourns or at least until March when the
                                President of the Security Council will be a Russian. Over the longer
                                term, <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> probably hopes
                                that economic and political concessions to the Kashmiri presently
                                being made will produce a majority for India in a future plebiscite.
                                This is not likely. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>
                                would probably settle for permanent partition of Kashmir along the
                                present cease-fire lines.</item>

                            <item>Pakistan is pressing for immediate action by the Security Council
                                to place <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> forces in Kashmir. The
                                Pakistan Government has stated that if India refused to accept the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> forces on India’s side of
                                the cease-fire line that Pakistan would accept them in
                                Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Pakistan is insisting upon implementation
                                of the original <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> resolutions
                                calling for a plebiscite in all of Kashmir. However, it would
                                probably settle for partition of the area with a plebiscite held in
                                the Vale itself, the heart of Kashmir. The Pakistani, like the
                                Indians, call our attention to an increase in Communist strength in
                                Pakistan if the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> failed to take
                                positive action under vigorous U.S. leadership. The Pakistani
                                Foreign Minister, <persName corresp="#p_NMFK1">Noon</persName>, has
                                threatened to resign if U.S. failed to support Pakistan and he
                                implied that Pakistan’s whole pro-West foreign policy would be
                                affected by such U.S. failure. I believe that the Government of
                                Pakistan has the Free Kashmir (Azad Kashmir) forces under control.
                                These forces will probably be kept from launching hostilities until
                                Pakistan sees no other hope of favorable settlement. By allowing the
                                Azad Kashmir forces to attack Pakistan would be attempting to force
                                the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> to intervene.</item>

                        <p>On February 20, Australia, Cuba, the United Kingdom, and the United
                            States submitted another draft resolution to the Security Council
                            concerning the Kashmir dispute. It noted Pakistan’s proposal for the use
                            of a temporary United Nations force to aid in the demilitarization of
                            Kashmir and stated that the use of such a force <pb n="127"
                                xml:id="pg_127" facs="0149"/>deserved consideration. In addition,
                            the draft resolution requested the President of the Security Council,
                                <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Gunnar V. Jarring</persName> of Sweden,
                            to visit the subcontinent to examine with the Governments of India and
                            Pakistan proposals which, in his opinion, would help to bring about
                            demilitarization or further the settlement of the dispute. Although the
                            proposal received nine votes in its favor, the Soviet Union vetoed the
                            resolution. (<gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> doc. S/3792 and Corr.

                        <p>Following the rejection of the four-power draft resolution, Australia,
                            the United Kingdom, and the United States submitted a somewhat different
                            version of that proposal. Excluding all mention of a United Nations
                            force, the new draft resolution called upon the Council to request its
                            President to visit the subcontinent, explore the possibility for a
                            settlement of the Kashmir dispute with India and Pakistan, and report to
                            the Council no later than April 15, 1957. On February 21, the
                            three-power draft resolution was adopted by the Security Council by a
                            vote of 10 to 0, with 1 abstention (the Soviet Union). (<gloss

                                <p>“Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                                <p>“Thank you very much for your message of February thirteenth. I
                                    am aware of your deep interest in the problem of Kashmir and of
                                    your hopes, which I share, for a settlement within the framework
                                    of the United Nations.</p>
                                <p>“The United States, along with other Security Council members,
                                    has assumed an active role in the Council’s current discussions
                                    of Kashmir in an effort to assist the parties toward a
                                    satisfactory settlement. The five-power resolution of January
                                    twenty-fourth, which the Council approved, was a step in this
                                    direction. Our resolution of February fourteenth, which we
                                    submitted along with the Governments of the United Kingdom,
                                    Australia and Cuba, was, <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0150"
                                    />in our view, the most constructive step the Council could have
                                    taken at this time. Unfortunately, the Soviet Union,
                                    disregarding the wishes of the majority of the Council, vetoed
                                    it. Despite the action of the Soviet Union, I believe the
                                    subsequent action of the Council on February twenty-first, in
                                    authorizing its President to confer with the parties, represents
                                    a forward step.</p>
                                <p>“The United Nations has an obligation to continue to strive for a
                                    just solution of this issue. The United States has consistently
                                    supported its efforts and shall continue to do so.</p>

                                    to put through a much stronger resolution, but that it
                                    encountered a Soviet veto. <persName corresp="#p_ASA1">Amjad
                                        Ali</persName> said that if the Soviets vetoed another
                                    resolution Pakistan would take the Kashmir case to the General
                                    Assembly. The Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_ASA1">Amjad
                                        Ali</persName> if he thought Pakistan would be able to get
                                    the necessary two-thirds majority and the Finance Minister said
                                    the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> thought so. They had
                                    collected clippings from all over the world and that it was
                                    obvious that world press opinion was on Pakistan’s side. He
                                    hoped that this was an indication of widespread government
                                    support. Pakistan, however, was canvassing the members of the
                                    General Assembly to find out their attitudes. In response to The
                                    Secretary’s question concerning timing, <persName

                        <p>In this respect, it would appear to be better have constructive proposal

                            refrained from intemperate statements. If return to relative calm is
                            brought about by such passage of time, it is possible realization by
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> that it has not convinced world
                            of Tightness its position and that its prestige is consequently

                            solution other than by plebiscite.</p>
                        <p>I should like to state my personal conviction, after my first 6 weeks in
                            India, that no solution based upon a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            plebiscite can be considered either constructive or realistic. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> are deeply and sincerely convinced that such a
                            plebiscite under present conditions would not only not be a peaceful
                            solution, but would also prejudice the stability and vital interests of
                            their nation. Their feeling that plebiscite would lead to violent
                            communal strife which would gravely affect large Muslim population in
                            India and shake the foundations of the secular state they are attempting
                            to build is deeply and, I believe sincerely, held. It is a risk which
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> unwilling to take. It is an
                            awkward position for them to explain, of course, and they have instead
                            attempted to rely upon legalistic and moral arguments, on whose latter
                            grounds Pakistan’s case can be presented in a much simpler and more
                            persuasive fashion. I am not yet prepared to say whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> and his government’s conviction
                            that the maintenance of at least the status quo in Kashmir is of vital
                            national interest is sound or not, but I do believe it is what <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> and his colleagues deeply feel
                            and that this fact constitutes a reality which foreign governments have
                            to face.</p>
                        <p>Although the origins are obviously different I am impressed with certain
                            similarities between Kashmir situation and that existing formerly in
                            Trieste. There it was necessary to allow tempers to cool off, to wait
                            until Italian elections had taken place so that there would be in
                            existence a government able to agree to a settlement (similar situation
                            might apply in Pakistan) and then to undertake behind-the-scenes private
                            and confidential negotiations. In Trieste neither side renounced its
                            claims but I believe settlement is now accepted as final and fair.
                            Perhaps something similar may be indicated here with possible approach
                            to overall settlements of Indo-Pakistan problems.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador said that he had been impressed during his stay in India
                            with the strong feelings of the Indian people on the Kashmir issue. He
                            had found that the Indians were very pleased with the Prime Minister’s
                            visit. During the course of the visit an Indo-American Friendship
                            Society had been established by members of both Houses of the Indian
                            Parliament.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately there had been some diminution in the friendly feelings of
                            the Indian people for the US in the period which had elapsed since the
                            Prime Minister’s visit. The Ambassador was asked during his stay in
                            India why the President’s “Middle East” doctrine had not been discussed
                            with the Prime Minister during the talks that the Prime Minister had had
                            with the President. The Ambassador said that he had replied that at the
                            time of the Prime Minister’s visit the doctrine was in its early stages,
                            and had very suddenly been developed.</p>
                        <p>The consideration by the Security Council of the Kashmir problem, which
                            had taken place during the Indian elections, had also had an adverse
                            effect upon the friendly spirit engendered by the Prime Minister’s
                            visit. The Ambassador said that he did not wish to go into the merits of
                            the Kashmir case. General public feeling in India, at least among the
                            educated classes, had become rather embittered against the West as the
                            result of the Security Council action on Kashmir. Indians felt as the
                            result of this action that only the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> was with India; other countries were against her. This
                            feeling had been intensified by the statements of the Pakistan Prime
                            Minister to the effect that Pakistan’s friends had “paid off” for
                            Pakistan’s alignment with the West through standing with Pakistan on the
                            Kashmir problem. Indian public opinion felt that the position which the
                            Western countries had taken on the problem had not been based on the
                            merits of the case.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador added that he had also found during his stay in India that
                            the Indian people were greatly concerned over the increase in Pakistan’s
                            military potential. He himself had seen the reply of an ex-governor of
                            an Indian state to a letter claiming that there were atomic bases in
                            Pakistan. The Ambassador said that he <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132"
                                facs="0154"/>told the ex-governor that he should take no notice of
                            the claim. There was a real fear among the Indian people that Pakistan
                            might take “hasty action”, or let the tribesmen do it as had been the
                            case in 1947 in Kashmir. The Pakistanis had later admitted that their
                            troops had entered Kashmir. There was some apprehension in India that
                            the Pakistanis might again create such a situation. The Prime Minister
                            himself was concerned, particularly in view of the wild claims made in
                            Pakistan about declaring a “holy war” against India.</p>
                        <p>When he was queried in India on this question, the Ambassador said that
                            he had pointed to the Secretary’s statement during the latter’s visit to
                            New Delhi that in case of aggression by Pakistan the United States would
                            not support that country. The Ambassador feared, however, that it might
                            be difficult to determine exactly who the aggressor was in any future
                            trouble; that there might develop a confused situation. It would be much
                            better to prevent any aggression at all, rather than attempting to
                            determine who was the aggressor after trouble began.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the Prime Minister’s visit to the United States, the
                            Ambassador reiterated that the effects of the visit had been good in
                            India. In the electoral campaign the Prime Minister on several occasions
                            paid tribute to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> as a “man of peace”.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that when an issue divided two countries as sharply
                            and bitterly as the Kashmir issue had divided India and Pakistan, it
                            made it difficult for other countries. It was the general impression in
                            the US, he thought, that India was in the wrong in the Kashmir dispute.
                            This feeling was not related to the fact that Pakistan was allied with
                            the US in <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. Most people did not
                            connect Pakistan’s membership in <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                            with the Kashmir problem. It was probably over-simplification, but the
                            popular feeling here was that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had
                            proposed that a plebiscite be held to determine the future of Kashmir,
                            and that India refused to proceed with the plebiscite. The Secretary
                            wondered if the report soon to be submitted by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> would be a helpful factor in

                        <p>So far as the Secretary knew, there was no basis for the talk about
                            giving atomic training to the Pakistanis but that if the Ambassador
                            wished, he would look into it. There was certainly no question of our
                            supplying Pakistan with atomic weapons. It would be illegal to do so. We
                            are not able to do so for the British and French in NATO.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador remarked that it was very easy for reports about nuclear
                            weapons to become exaggerated. When the question of supplying nuclear
                            weapons to the Western European allies of the United States was
                            discussed in the press, reports inevitably appeared that Pakistan would
                            also obtain such weapons. Incidentally, the writer of the letter to the
                            ex-governor of the Indian state, to which he had referred earlier, was a
                            Communist.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the Kashmir issue, the Ambassador said that he understood
                            that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> had
                            discussed with the President the inadvisability of upsetting a settled
                            situation. To agitate the Kashmir issue would have a bad effect upon the
                            communal situation in India. The idea of establishing national states on
                            the basis of religion was absurd. There were 42 million Muslims in
                            India. It was the third largest Muslim state in the world. There was no
                            doubt that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>
                            was sincere in his desire to build up a secular state in India. Gandhi
                            had died for this principle.</p>
                        <p>There was another aspect of the Kashmir question to be considered. If the
                            situation should be upset, disturbed conditions might result. If this
                            should be the case it was well known that the Chinese and Russians liked
                            to fish in troubled waters.</p>

                                of the U.S. provision of arms to Pakistan. They emphasized that
                                since India could not afford to gamble with its very existence it
                                had been attempting to counter Pakistan’s arms buildup by stepping
                                up its own purchases of arms from abroad, using the United Kingdom
                                and France as its chief suppliers. Should Pakistani armament keep
                                increasing, the Indian officials pointed out, India might have to
                                purchase equivalent arms from “other sources.” (<hi rend="italic"

                            not be embarrassing to him. He thought that such a visit might be
                            helpful. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> was a
                            strange person. He had done a beautiful job in briefing the War College
                            group which had recently visited India. He had answered all the
                            questions of the group in a reasonable and friendly manner. The War
                            College group had been pleased with its trip to India and thought that
                            India should be included in all future itineraries of the War
                            College.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> said that Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> had sent his
                            regards to the Secretary. The Indians still were critical towards a
                            number of United States policies, including Kashmir and regional
                            security pacts. He thought, however, that the visit of Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> to the US had been
                            helpful and had resulted in a better understanding by the Prime Minister
                            of basic US policies.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that we had also obtained a clearer understanding
                            of Indian policy and thinking as a result of the visit. The world was
                            now in the process of evolving an effective collective security system.
                            A comparison might be made between the efforts now being made to develop
                            a security system and a man’s efforts to protect his own home.
                            Previously he had to depend upon his own resources; now he depended upon
                            a police force for protection. The Secretary appreciated the fact that
                            to Pakistan the problem of India loomed larger than that of the Soviet
                            Union. He also understood the Indian fear that military equipment
                            furnished Pakistan by the US might be misused. He himself, however,
                            thought it unlikely that misuse of the equipment would occur. There was
                            the danger of a <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0158"/>cyclone of
                            events resulting in a situation so confused that it would be difficult
                            to determine who was the aggressor and who was aggressed against. He
                            could understand how India would like to see Pakistan in a state of
                            military inferiority to it. Nevertheless, Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> should understand our motives and
                            philosophy.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> replied that he
                            thought Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> did
                            understand. At least he understood better than anyone else in India.</p>

                        <p>Secretary replied along following lines: He impressed Pakistan’s
                            willingness arbitrate but questioned whether it would get us anywhere
                            show up opposite attitude India. He felt we should exhaust every
                            possibility for settlement and not exclude any proposed resolution
                            solely on basis it probably would be vetoed by Soviet Union. He believed
                            Soviets would probably veto anything of substance but it might be good
                            idea let Indians know matters could not drift indefinitely. He doubted
                            Indians would like be in position of depending again on Soviet veto. We
                            would naturally have to consult <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0159"

                            action. Secretary emphasized he was speaking in broad generalities which
                            were hard to translate into action. There might be very little we could
                            do but we would certainly try to think of some meaningful action.</p>
                        <p>In response previous suggestion by <persName corresp="#p_NMFK1"
                                >Noon</persName> that American aid to India be used as lever to

                                to settle the Kashmir problem since the consequence would be war.

                        <p>The Prime Minister declared that during the Commonwealth Prime Ministers
                            Conference just completed in London the British Prime Minister had tried
                            to arrange a meeting between the Prime Ministers of Pakistan and India.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHS1">Suhrawardy</persName> had avoided such a
                            meeting. He had told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>
                            that Pakistan was being provoked by <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName>, who threatens Pakistan in the Indus waters
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then observed that Pakistan could be starved out if
                            India chose to cut off water from Punjab. The Prime Minister then asked
                            rhetorically what the Pakistanis should do. He answered that they would
                            fight. The Americans and British threw up their arms at such statements.
                            He agreed 100 percent that such a war would present a drain upon
                            Pakistan’s non-existent resources. India was four or five times stronger
                            than the Pakistanis were.</p>
                        <p>There were two ways to avoid such a development which had been tested on
                            past occasions. In March 1950 <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> had massed troops with the intention of making war
                            upon Pakistan. In this instance war had been avoided by Liaquat
                                Ali’s<note n="3" xml:id="d59fn3"><persName>Liaquat Ali

                            to Delhi in which compromises were made. In July 1951 <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> had again massed troops and had
                            even signed “the order to make war”, but was advised that Pakistan’s
                            newly received Liberators would be able to retaliate to the extent of
                            bombing New Delhi and other Indian cities.</p>
                        <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0161"/>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SHS1">Suhrawardy</persName> argued
                            that it was only recently that India had begun to advance the contention
                            that “preliminary conditions had not been met” making fulfillment by
                            India of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions on Kashmir
                            impossible. (The Prime Minister had reference to the cease-fire
                            provisions of the <gloss target="#t_UNCIP1">UNCIP</gloss> resolutions.)
                            Until recently the Indians had based their position on three other
                            arguments: a) when the US had extended military assistance to Pakistan,
                            India had answered that the Kashmir issue was ended; b) when Pakistan
                            had joined the Baghdad Pact, <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> had again declared that the question was ended
                            because the balance of power had been altered; and c) when elections had
                            taken place in Kashmir and a Constituent Assembly formed, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> had again declared that the
                            question was ended. This position he took despite the fact that a
                            Security Council resolution had pointed out that nothing done in Kashmir
                            by either party to the dispute would have any effect on the previous
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions calling for a
                            plebiscite.</p>
                        <p>During the recent discussions which the Pakistanis have had in London
                            with the British, the latter expressed the view that a Security Council
                            resolution on Kashmir should not mention the plebiscite but should
                            merely call upon both parties to demilitarize. The Prime Minister
                            observed that he did not like the resolution which had been prepared in
                            accordance with the British suggestion because it raised the question of
                            whether first steps towards implementation of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> resolutions had been taken (i.e. the cease-fire
                            provisions). In Pakistan’s view, there was no such question.</p>
                        <p>In concluding his discussion of Pakistan’s major disputes with India, the
                            Prime Minister again reverted to the canal waters question which he
                            described as the most immediate, contrasting it with the Kashmir
                            question which in his opinion would go on and on.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SHS1">Suhrawardy</persName> declared
                            that he would leave further discussion of Kashmir to his associates,
                            Messrs. Baig, Aftab and <persName corresp="#p_NMFK1">Noon</persName>.
                            They could discuss with the appropriate US officials the question of the
                            timing of next steps in the Kashmir issue. The Prime Minister added that
                            he himself favored immediate action in the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister also suggested that the details of the canal waters
                            dispute be discussed later, as he had not had time to read the Iliff
                                report.<note n="4" xml:id="d59fn4">This report by <persName>William

                        <p>The Secretary said he understood that United States and Pakistan
                            representatives had yesterday agreed upon a Kashmir resolution which the
                            United States could support.<note n="3" xml:id="d60fn3">This draft
                                resolution was discussed in a conversation between Baig and

                                >Rountree</persName> seconded that view, observing that we had
                            indicated to the Pakistani representative that the US would wish to have
                            consultations with other members of the United Nations before assuming a
                            final position. The Secretary said that he thought we could support the
                            present draft with some changes in wording.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHS1">Suhrawardy</persName> asked whether the
                            United States or Pakistan should initiate the discussions mentioned by
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName>. In his response,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said that it was our
                            view that the locus of future discussions on the Kashmir issue might
                            best be moved to New York and that the consultations to which he
                            referred would also be carried out in New York. While the precise
                            procedure to be followed in the consultations could be determined at a
                            later date, it <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0163"/>might be better
                            for the Pakistanis to open consultations with members of the Council
                            regarding the type of action they desired. We might thereafter hold
                            consultations with other members regarding the terms of the resolution.
                            We would maintain close liaison with Pakistan representatives, both here
                            and in New York.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked about the timing of the introduction of the
                            resolution in the Security Council. He observed that the British thought
                            the <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> report should be
                            discussed before the resolution was introduced.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> replied that we
                            thought that the question of timing was primarily one to be worked out
                            by the parties in consultation with the members of the Security Council.
                            We had no strong views of our own and would go along with the views of
                            the parties and the other Council members. Our only qualification was
                            that we thought there should be sufficient advance notice of the holding
                            of the hearings to enable adequate consultations to be held to organize
                            the session properly. At least a week would be required for this
                            purpose. We understood that Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_NMFK1">Noon</persName> believed that discussions in the
                            Council should not be initiated until the end of August.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister indicated that late August might be satisfactory to
                            the Pakistanis for the initiation of the discussions on Kashmir but
                            expressed doubt that they should be deferred after that date.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he wished to speak a moment about India
                            before saying goodby. The instability of East Bengal was entirely the
                            result of Indian-inspired subversion. If the Americans had not yet
                            learned to recognize the Indians in their true colors, they were bound
                            to do so in time. India’s neutralism was called “positive neutralism” by
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>; the Prime Minister
                            preferred to call it “offensive neutralism”. (Mr. Husain then showed an
                            intelligence map<note n="4" xml:id="d60fn4">Not printed.</note>
                            purporting to demonstrate that three-quarters of the Indian army was
                            ranged along the border of West Pakistan facing Pakistani forces of
                            one-fourth their strength.)</p>
                        <p>Concluding the meeting, the Secretary declared that he had spoken with
                            utmost frankness on all topics covered in the conversations; it had been
                            a great satisfaction to have such frank talks with the Prime Minister.
                            The Prime Minister expressed his appreciation to the Secretary for the
                            very helpful discussions.</p>

                            area’s defense against Communist aggression unless also able defend
                            themselves against India. They made it clear that Phase Two military
                            items would be separate and distinct from their requirements deriving
                            from their responsibility under the Baghdad Pact.</p>
                        <p>I have refrained from commenting on this telegram pending receipt of
                            memorandum of conversation, which has now come.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that the situation disclosed by this talk, when put
                            together with attitudes here, presents a very serious situation.
                            Pakistan is planning a build-up to counter Indian strength. The Indians
                            appear almost pathologically afraid of Pakistan, despite their superior
                            numerical strength, and are building up their air and naval strength to
                            offset our aid to Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>So what we are now facing is an arms race between these two countries,
                            contributed to in fact, though not in intent, by our military aid to
                            Pakistan. I fully agree that our military aid to Pakistan is necessary
                            and right in terms of equipping her to discharge her responsibilities
                            under the Baghdad Pact and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. But
                            it is quite another matter for us even to consider providing her with
                            military aid specifically designed for use as an offset to Indian
                            strength. This would inevitably become known.</p>
                        <p>I was glad to see from the memo of conversation dated July 12 that the
                            Secretary had implied disapproval of this type of arms race.</p>
                        <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0166"/>
                        <p>The greatest single liability that the US has in its relationship with
                            India is the fact of arms aid to Pakistan. We have been able thus far to
                            convince Indian leaders that this aid is not directed against India,
                            though they believe that the Pakistanis want to use it against them.
                            They do, I believe, accept the fact we would strongly disapprove and try
                            to prevent any such use. However if we do give military aid to Pakistan
                            in response to a specific request for its use as a counter to India and
                            in amounts admitted to be in excess of Pakistan’s needs to meet her
                            collective security obligations, our whole case with India will fall to
                            the ground, their worst fears will be realized, and our influence here
                            will be greatly lessened.</p>
                        <p>I therefore hope most sincerely that the Department will make it clear to
                            the Pakistanis that while we will give aid to help Pakistan discharge
                            her collective security obligations, we will not consider military aid
                            when requested purely as a counter to India, nor will we either speed up
                            or extend our current <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> to them
                            beyond collective security requirements.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, I believe we should be justified in cautioning the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> that its build-up in bombers and
                            navy is bringing us under increasing pressure to extend our aid to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>, since the Pakistanis feel that
                            Indian military superiority is thereby increasing too much. We might say
                            that the extent of this Indian build-up seems to us to have the
                            Pakistanis genuinely worried, on the ground it is going beyond purely
                            defensive needs.</p>

                        <p>1. Number major problems confront India and Pakistan. These include need
                            to achieve (a) moratorium on arms race (b) workable division Indus
                            waters (c) solution Kashmir issue. In addition both countries facing
                            great difficulties attempting to increase, or at least maintain,
                            economic development programs.</p>

                        <p>2. All these problems, indirectly, affect US. All interrelated. India’s

                            to offer US opportunity approach both countries in attempt help them

                        <p>3. Two alternative methods achieving progress on issues paragraph 1 might
                            be envisaged: (a) agreement to halt present arms race, which would
                            reduce tensions between two countries, followed eventually by agreement
                            on Kashmir and Indus waters. May be that last two issues difficult
                            resolve separately because resolution could require offsetting
                            concessions by India and Pakistan: (b) package solution involving all
                            three issues (arms, Kashmir, Indus waters). Interrelationship of issues
                            is such that “package” solution is preferable, may be more
                            practicable.</p>

                        <p>4. Whichever approach adopted, we should seek bring about: (a) Immediate
                            agreement limit armed forces to something like present levels, possibly
                            coupled with inspection against surprise attack. Precise level and

                        <p>The Ambassador, in answer to a question, stated that to the best of his
                            knowledge this further request for U.S. assurance by the Foreign
                            Minister originated with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMFK1"
                                >Noon</persName> and was not based upon a considered opinion of the
                            Government of Pakistan that it needed such an assurance.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMFK1"
                                >Noon</persName> had been highly appreciative of Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ statement regarding <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and U.S. support for local armies.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMFK1">Noon</persName> had instructed him to
                            inform the Department that the Government of Pakistan would welcome any
                            magnitude of expansion of U.S. support to the Pakistan army on the firm
                            understanding that such Pakistani troops would be available for use by
                            the United States anywhere in the world. Two divisions could be raised
                            easily. The Ambassador, in answer to a query, stated that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NMFK1">Noon</persName>’s offer had not been cleared with
                            his Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> stated that he would
                            only be able to make general observations at this time to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NMFK1">Noon</persName>’s further requests or
                            suggestions. He pointed out to the Ambassador that U.S. policy regarding
                            aggression of any sort, in any part of the world, was certainly
                            well-known having been demonstrated on numerous occasions. As to
                            formalizing an agreement such as a mutual defense pact between Pakistan
                            and the United States, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
                                >Rountree</persName> observed that such agreements are really
                            treaties; they require time-consuming, detailed negotiations. He told
                            the Ambassador that he would relay Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMFK1"
                                >Noon</persName>’s request and suggestions to the Secretary and
                            would get in touch with the Ambassador on these subjects as soon as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>As the Ambassador was being escorted to his automobile, he suggested to
                            the Departmental officer accompanying him that a further alternative to
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMFK1">Noon</persName>’s request for written
                            assurances of U.S. support in case Pakistan were attacked would be for
                            the Secretary to arrange an appointment to see Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NMFK1">Noon</persName> prior to the latter’s departure
                            for Pakistan, now tentatively scheduled for early November. The
                            Ambassador said this suggestion was his own. However, he was sure Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NMFK1">Noon</persName> would be most
                            appreciative if, as a result of such a meeting, he could return to his
                            new government in Karachi and assure them of continuing U.S. support and
                            interest in Pakistan.</p>

                                    our already announced position and the views of other members of
                                    the Security Council, it seems certain that the Council cannot
                                    avoid some reference in its resolution to the present status of
                                    the cease-fire order.</p>
                                <p>However, I fully believe that, if the Council does adopt a
                                    position in accordance with that outlined by our representative,
                                    such action will constitute a definite step forward. I wish to
                                    assure you that I shall follow the developments on the Kashmir
                                    dispute in the Security Council with continuing deep interest
                                    and with trust that any progress toward ultimate solution of the
                                    problem cannot but be welcome to both Pakistan and India.</p>
                                <p>The basic objective of the Government of the United States
                                    remains, as always, a just and peaceful solution of a problem of
                                    such <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0174"/>importance to the
                                    future of the Subcontinent. In the absence of a solution through
                                    direct negotiations, I believe that the only constructive course
                                    of action lies in the implementation of the Security Council’s
                                    basic resolutions. This I feel certain is in accordance with
                                    your own Government’s objectives. Sincerely, <persName

                                    any position. It should be made clear to India and to Pakistan
                                    that in furnishing them with present or future financial
                                    assistance, we expect they will cooperate with the bank’s plan

                                <item>The “arms race” is at least in part conditioned by the U.S.
                                    commitment made to Pakistan in October 1954. It appears to me
                                    that the preferable course would be to work with the Pakistanis
                                    on their military budget and related matters, with a view
                                    towards reduction of our future liabilities. Any reduction in
                                    the military program to Pakistan should, in view of the intimacy
                                    of the relationship, be discussed with Pakistan prior to any
                                    conversations with India on this subject. It would be an error
                                    to fail to recognize that our relationships with Pakistan in
                                    matters of this kind are more intimate than our relationships
                                    with India.</item>

                                <item>In general, it is my judgment that an over-all settlement of
                                    all issues cannot be worked out, as the Kashmir problem is
                                    intractable. It follows that we should not commit the prestige
                                    of the U.S. to a course of action (the package deal) which has
                                    little chance of a successful outcome. Sooner or later the fact
                                    of the proposed intervention would leak out, and we should then
                                    be faced with a public failure.</item>

                                November 22, Wadsworth stated that he was “absolutely convinced”
                                that the Security Council would never be able to bring about Indian
                                acquiescence in a plebiscite for Kashmir. “Continued discussion of
                                Kashmir in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> now injures our
                                relations with India,” he noted, “and will have little real future
                                value for Pakistan, since it now seems clear Soviets will veto any
                                proposed Council action which moves towards holding of plebiscite.”
                                In the long run, he pointed out, the United States would be in an
                                easier position with India and Pakistan if the Kashmir problem was
                                transferred to the General Assembly. Wadsworth believed that if any
                                real solution to the dispute could be found, it would necessarily be
                                accomplished by secret mediation efforts carried on by an
                                appropriate third party, such as the British, the Canadians, or the
                                Americans; it would probably have to be a solution based
                                substantially on the status quo, he emphasized. (Department of

                        <p>Regarding the current consideration of Kashmir in the Security Council,
                            the Secretary noted that the United States had collaborated closely with
                            the Pakistan representatives, but not with the Indian. The United States
                            had special ties with Pakistan. The United States also thought Pakistan
                            had a meritorious case. Actually the Soviets had threatened to use their
                            veto only to gain credit with India. Although the Secretary himself
                            thought that the ultimate solution to the problem would only be through
                            quiet, diplomatic action, this did not mean that the United Nations
                            should not try to be helpful in creating and strengthening the right
                            kind of public opinion.</p>
                        <p>In the Secretary’s view the present resolution should be pushed to a
                            Soviet veto. It should not be rewritten, for a veto would put India in
                            an awkward position in relation to world opinion and, therefore,
                            Pakistan would be the one to gain from it. After a veto Pakistan must be
                            its own judge as to whether to introduce another resolution or to have
                            one introduced for it, but a weak resolution would be bad. The Secretary
                            would not himself compromise on a “milk-sop” resolution because the
                            objective of the present Security Council action is to create a
                            favorable and strong world opinion looking toward the eventual solution
                            of the Kashmir problem. Yet the Secretary explained that actually the
                            Security Council—no matter what action it took, whether its resolution
                            was hard or soft—could not really solve the Kashmir question as long as
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> basically disagreed with the
                            Security Council’s approach.</p>
                        <p>Whether Pakistan should eventually bring the matter to the General
                            Assembly was an important question. It would be necessary, before
                            deciding it, to count potential supporters carefully because a new
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> resolution might well wipe out the
                            protection which Pakistan currently enjoys under the present <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions. This <pb n="157"
                                xml:id="pg_157" facs="0179"/>was a definite risk. The Secretary did
                            not know the answer. India, he speculated, might be able to command only
                            25 or so votes, but on the other hand Pakistan might not be able to
                            muster the necessary two-thirds. The Secretary did not feel qualified to
                            give the Foreign Minister any advice on this matter, except that he
                            certainly would not recommend going precipitously to the General
                            Assembly and then thinking it over afterwards. Naturally, if the United
                            States representatives could be helpful in assessing the voting position
                            in the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, they would be glad to do so,
                            but Pakistan must take the primary responsibility for evaluating the
                            situation, particularly as regards the voting possibilities of the
                            Afro-Asian bloc. Pakistan should not, the Secretary repeated, make any
                            final decision until it had thought through the whole problem
                            thoroughly.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister thanked the Secretary for his valued views.</p>

                        <p>Reviewing briefly the fears of Pakistan vis-à-vis India, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NMFK1">Noon</persName> noted that on partition the
                            United Kingdom Government had given India practically all of the former
                            British arsenals and weapons then in India. The Pakistan army at that
                            time did not even have enough small arms to equip its infantry soldiers.
                            Then the United States and Pakistan entered into their military aid
                            agreement and Pakistan was reassured against the ever present threat
                            from India. Now, however, India was expanding its armaments on a very
                            large scale. The Foreign Minister believed that part of this build-up by
                                <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0180"/>India had been made
                            possible through United States economic assistance to that country which
                            in turn permitted India to divert its own resources to military
                            procurement. In these circumstances, the Foreign Minister asserted, it
                            was not sufficient for the United States just to say: “We’ll help you;
                            we’ll help you”. What the United States should actually do was to bring
                            pressure on India to stop its military build-up by refusing to give
                            further aid to India until that country settled the Kashmir issue in
                            accordance with the decisions of the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMFK1">Noon</persName> maintained that the
                            Soviets’ stock had gone up in the East thanks to its veto on the Kashmir
                            issue. This was because Asians believe it is natural to make peace with
                            the devil himself, since he will destroy you, provided the other side is
                            represented by a gentleman. The Russians wanted only to increase
                            tensions in the area over Kashmir and this must be countered by the
                            United States helping the Security Council to retrieve its position.</p>
                        <p>Regarding attaching conditions to our aid to India, the Secretary was
                            convinced that it was good for the world to have a great power like the
                            United States which was determined not to sell its veto power to the
                            highest bidder. This, of course, was what the Soviets were doing with
                            their veto in the Kashmir situation. It was also good to have a world
                            power which maintained a consistent position and which did not shift
                            sides for momentary advantage. It would of course be gratifying to the
                            friends of the United States if this country could go along with them
                            100% on all issues—and the Indians are our friends too—but this might
                            not promote the basic conditions for bringing about true peace with
                            justice in such a complex situation as Kashmir.</p>
                        <p>Thus this government cannot attach political “strings” to United States
                            economic assistance to India; such assistance was itself important for
                            the free world. This stand, however, did not mean that the United States
                            could not let the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> know that in the
                            opinion of the United States Government the <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> should fulfill its commitment to settle the Kashmir

                            in an effort to persuade world opinion that it was thereby being forced

                        <p>On November 27, Sweden introduced a number of amendments to the
                            five-power resolution of November 22 which deleted any reference to the

                            resolutions of August 13, 1948, and January 5, 1949, and recommended the

                            Affairs, a copy of <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>’s memorandum
                            regarding a possible “package” approach to the Governments of Pakistan
                            and India with a view toward attempting to resolve the principal areas
                            of conflict presently existing between these two countries. In your
                            letter of transmittal you suggested to Mr. Sprague that you would like
                            to discuss the proposal with him as soon as possible.<note n="2"

                        <p>The basic purpose of your meeting with Mr. Sprague would be to prepare
                            the ground for eventually securing the consent of the Department of
                            Defense to the military portion of the package. This, you will recall,
                            involves both Pakistan’s and India’s limiting by mutual consent their
                            military build-up and thus in effect controlling the present unfortunate
                            arms race in which they are both indulging.</p>
                        <p>In presenting the Department of State’s view on this aspect of the
                            “package”, you might wish to point out to Mr. Sprague that we have
                            included arms limitation in the package for three principal reasons: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>As long as Pakistan fears India’s military posture and
                                    intentions, Pakistan’s divisions, newly armed by the United
                                    States, will in effect be tied down to protecting West
                                    Pakistan’s eastern frontier and therefore unavailable for
                                    regional defense. This was clearly indicated even before our
                                    military assistance to Pakistan when, during the Korean war,
                                    Pakistan through fear of India was unwilling to send troops to
                                    Korea unless the United States was willing formally to guarantee
                                    Pakistan against possible Indian aggression. This the United
                                    States Government was at that time unwilling to do so that no
                                    troops were sent. With the Pakistan–Indian military position
                                    stabilized and with each country reassured of United States
                                    support in the event of aggression by the other, the Pakistan
                                    Army, Navy and Air Force would in effect be freed to perform the
                                    mission for which we have armed them. Thus the ending of the
                                    present arms race between the two countries would actually
                                    strengthen rather <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0183"/>than

                                    against such subversion, yet both India and Pakistan by
                                    indulging in an arms race between themselves are diverting
                                    domestic resources, badly needed for economic development, to
                                    unproductive military purposes. The Finance Ministers of both
                                    countries, but especially of Pakistan, have recently
                                    acknowledged and deplored this situation.</item>

                                    home to him some of the practical difficulties which we face in
                                    the larger East-West disarmament problem, and might, therefore,
                                    take a more appreciative attitude towards our basic position on
                                    disarmament than he has taken previously. If this were the case,

                        <p>The objective of United States policy in the dispute between India and
                            Portugal over <gloss target="#t_GOA1">Goa</gloss> was to encourage a
                            peaceful settlement and thereby preserve and strengthen friendly
                            relations with both countries. Portugal was a NATO Ally in whose
                            territories the United States maintained, and wished to expand, military
                            bases. The United States perceived India, the largest power in South
                            Asia, as a friendly neutral country with which the United States and the
                            Soviet Union were each working for closer ties. Major documentation on

                        <p>I share your concern over the Afghan situation. I do not, however, share
                            the views of the Afghan government that the way to strengthen
                            Afghanistan is to side with it against our ally Pakistan. To support the
                            government in Kabul on the Pushtunistan issue would mean, in the last
                            analysis, to abet the partition of another friendly country. Instead, we
                            believe that the only sound basis for improving the situation is to
                            foster cooperation between Afghanistan and its southern neighbor. This
                            view, which is based on the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> decision
                            of last December, was given to the Afghans in an aide-mémoire which I am

                            favorable. However, the urgency of the problem requires that we consider
                            providing assistance to cooperative economic projects which would draw
                            the two countries together, strengthen Afghanistan’s ability to resist
                            Soviet enticements, and in this way bring Afghanistan closer to the
                            West. To this end we are considering a $30 million program for which we
                            might be able to draw on the proposed foreign aid contingency fund. We
                            have, however, turned aside for the moment the Afghan request for
                            military aid, since it would probably create more problems vis-à-vis the
                            Soviet Union than it would solve.</p>

                        <p>On March 27, the Pakistani Government promulgated an “Emergency Powers
                            Ordinance,” which enabled the implementation of a plan to amalgamate the
                            four provinces of West Pakistan into a single province. A variety of
                            political and administrative factors motivated this “One Unit” plan, the
                            most important of which was the need to balance the political
                            relationship between East and West Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>Two days later Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName>
                            broadcast a speech over Radio Kabul in which he denounced Pakistan’s
                            action as a denial of the aspirations of the Pushtuns and promised the
                            support of his government to its Pushtun brethren in Pakistan. On March
                            30, a mob attacked the Pakistani Embassy and residency in Kabul,
                            inflicting severe damage and injuring several Pakistani employees. In
                            addition, the mob lowered the Pakistani flag and hoisted a Pushtunistan
                            flag in its stead. The American Embassy in Kabul, which noted that
                            several unsuccessful attempts had been made to enter forcibly the cars
                            of two United States citizens in that city, judged that the attacks were
                            “quite evidently” both “inspired and sponsored” by the Afghan
                            Government. (Telegram 392 from Kabul, March 30; Department of State,
                            Central Files, 789.00/3–3055) On the following day, Afghan mobs carried
                            out similar attacks on the Pakistani Consulates in Qandahar and

                                Egyptian Minister of State, had proposed that a public ceremony be
                                held in Kabul at which Sadat would raise the Pakistani flag with
                                full military honors, followed by a similar ceremony to raise the
                                Afghan flag in Peshawar. Pakistan, however, had rejected this
                                Egyptian effort at conciliation. During the second conversation,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MZS1">Shah</persName> stated that while he

                                where the overall solution of Pakistan–Afghanistan problems was
                                possible. Accordingly, he suggested that the U.S., British, and
                                Pakistani Ambassadors speak with the King of Afghanistan, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MZS1">Mohammed Zahir Shah</persName>, and point out
                                that the continuance of present Afghan policies was intolerable and
                                the only solution was a drastic change in government. In commenting
                                upon these discussions, Ambassador Ward endorsed <persName

                                    <p>It is as a friend, faced by common danger that Government of
                                        US finds itself compelled to instruct its Ambassador to lay
                                        before His Majesty certain views which it considers of
                                        sufficient importance to justify His Majesty’s personal
                                        consideration. US has observed with greatest concern recent
                                        signs of deterioration in relations between Pakistan and
                                        Afghanistan both of which are subject to the threat of
                                        communist imperialism. US believes that Government of
                                        Afghanistan has very real responsibility to restrain those
                                        elements within its country who would attempt settle
                                        disputes with Pakistan by threats and actual violence.
                                        Particularly the US has been disturbed and shocked by the
                                        indignities and damages suffered by diplomatic and consular
                                        establishments of Pakistan in Afghanistan which the Afghan
                                        Government failed to suppress. The hopes of the Afghan
                                        Government for economic development and material improvement
                                        of its people must depend in large degree on the expansion
                                        of its commerce with Pakistan and the other nations of the
                                        free world. It is hoped that every effort will be made by
                                        the Government of Afghanistan to make suitable amends to the
                                        Government and people of Pakistan. His Majesty is
                                        undoubtedly aware of the uneasiness caused among the
                                        diplomatic community of Kabul and the necessity for taking

                        <p>King was quite stiff and formal at beginning audience, perhaps in
                            anticipation of some strong demand, but as conversation progressed he
                            relaxed and became as unposed and congenial as in former conversations
                            with result we were shortly chatting. <persName corresp="#p_DM1"
                                >Daud</persName> was not mentioned or even referred to by direct
                            allusion. During chat he evidenced much knowledge of my activities in
                            U.S. aid programs and recalled my statement of November 1952 that so
                            long as I am here shall [devote?] myself to Afghanistan’s well-being.
                            This encouraged me express view well-being not being furthered by
                            Government of Afghanistan insistence honorable amends be made
                            simultaneously by Government of Afghanistan and Government of Pakistan,
                            reminding him that Government of Afghanistan cast first stone and struck
                            first blow on March 30 in Kabul, on March 31 at Jalalabad and Qandahar,
                            all which preceded April 1 Peshawar affair, and that Government of
                            Afghanistan should therefore make first amends, trusting Government of
                            Pakistan to make subsequent amends for any Pakistan wrongdoing. He
                            received this in very good part. I further made bold to mention that
                            Afghanistan well-being <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0199"/>would be
                            prospered by constructive Afghanistan-Pakistan collaboration, closer
                            economic ties with free world, incentive to private enterprise,
                            expansion work looking toward improvement in agricultural method and
                            standard of living and improved maintenance of highways looking toward
                            betterment of economy and lowered cost living through reduction in
                            inordinately high trucking and distribution cost. He was very affable at
                            end our conversation, which lasted 50 minutes.</p>
                        <p>Audience was more successful than I had anticipated and I am certain
                            démarche will bear fruit, unless King so dominated by <persName

                            convictions. Should latter prove fact I fear, barring a swallowing of
                            pride by Government of Pakistan which could cause it dangerous loss
                            prestige among Afghans, Indians and some of its own peoples, worsening
                            of Afghanistan-Pakistan situation should be anticipated.</p>

                        <p>503. Kabul’s telegram 566 May 4.<note n="2" xml:id="d87fn2">In telegram
                                566, Ambassador Ward reported that the Afghan Government requested
                                him to inform both the President and the Secretary of State that it
                                desired U.S. mediation in the Pushtunistan dispute. Ward commented
                                that Afghanistan “will probably attempt use mediation to inject US
                                into Pushtunistan controversy as it has attempted do in the past.”
                                In addition, he cautioned that Afghanistan was now seeking to place
                                the burden for any further deterioration in Pakistan–Afghanistan
                                relations on the United States. U.S. mediation, moreover, would
                                likely give <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName> a “new lease
                                on life.” The Ambassador concluded this message with the following
                                    appraisal:<p>“In light above I believe actual US mediation
                                    probably unwise but refusal to attempt mediation would
                                    undoubtedly have serious repercussions US–Afghanistan relations
                                    particularly if <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName>
                                    survives. Judging by temper Pakistan Ambassador and staff here,
                                    I believe <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> not likely accept
                                    offer US mediation, particularly if handled as pro forma matter
                                    and we do not press acceptance. If so US offer mediate would not
                                    amount to more than friendly gesture to <gloss target="#t_GOA1"

                        <p>At a meeting of the National Security Council on May 5, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> raised the subject of
                            deteriorating relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan: <quote

                                <p>“The Director of Central Intelligence then proceeded to discuss
                                    the situation in Afghanistan. The Pakistanis had delivered an
                                    ultimatum to the Afghan Government. The Afghans, through their
                                    Foreign Minister, had requested the United States to mediate the
                                    quarrel. In addition, the press ticker carried the news that the
                                    Afghans have mobilized. They are supposed to have an army of
                                    about 42,000 and in addition had called up three reserve
                                    classes. In point of fact, however, Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> doubted whether
                                    Afghanistan could mobilize more than 28,000 men in the period
                                    D-plus-30. Accordingly, he doubted whether they could
                                    successfully attack Pakistan, although they might indulge in
                                    border raids.</p>
                                <p>“All in all, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                                    indicated the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> view that the
                                    Afghan mobilization was something of a face-saving device which
                                    was unlikely to lead to war.</p>

                                    that the State Department was not inclined to undertake this
                                    responsibility, and was looking for a well disposed Moslem
                                    country to undertake this task.</p>
                                <p>“Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said he
                                    was quite sure that the Soviet Union was involved in what was
                                    occurring in this area. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                                        >Hoover</persName> agreed with him, and the Vice President

                                        >Nehru</persName> was even more involved than the Soviets.

                                    commented that more than anyone else the Indians have been
                                    responsible for keeping the Pushtunistan dispute alive.
                                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> agreed,
                                    and said that the Indian Embassies in all of these countries of
                                    the Middle East area were the single most unsettling influence
                                    in them.</p>
                                <p>“Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said
                                    that he was by no means sure that the United States ought not to
                                    accept the request for its mediation, and pointed out how useful
                                    a role we had played in the Trieste negotiations. Secretary
                                        <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> replied that
                                    there was no objection whatever to proffering our good offices,
                                    but that formal mediation by the United States would evoke
                                    troublesome problems. He added that of course we had not
                                    formally mediated the Trieste dispute, but had worked behind the
                                    scenes through normal diplomatic action.” (Memorandum of

                            Arabia and Sudan I got five-minute separate talks with Foreign Office
                            Secretary Baig, Finance Minister Chaundhri Mohamad Ali, Minister
                            Interior <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> and Prime
                            Minister. Asked each what real crux of problem with Afghanistan was and
                            each gave same firm reply, essence of which was “removal of <gloss

                                corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName>”. I asked each Minister separately
                            if this was Cabinet policy or their personal opinion and each answered
                            “cabinet policy”. Each also said with varying degree of emphasis,
                            however, that if <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName> removed as

                                <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> and Baig said I was

                            King and Royal family.</p>

                            increased dependence on Soviets which would be alternative. (Factor
                            which affects Pakistan present policy calculations is their apprehension
                            that unless King can be induced to replace <persName corresp="#p_DM1"
                                >Daud</persName> now <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName> may

                            have been impressed by unanimity of views expressed by both Americans
                            and Pakistanis who know Afghanistan well, that (1) <persName

                            thwart any improvement in general Pakistan–Afghan relations so long as
                            he continues in power and (2) continuation of present developments
                            unchecked will result in irrevocable loss Afghanistan to Soviets (with
                            estimates of period of grace varying from six months to two years). We
                            also note from Embassy Kabul’s messages that Pakistan pressure is now
                            being strongly felt by Afghan Government and that there are indications
                            Royal family considering replacement <persName corresp="#p_DM1"

                        <p>Due these considerations Embassy feels US would be assuming serious
                            responsibility in pressuring Pakistanis to apply palliatives to ills
                            which they convinced require surgery. If by our intervention we check
                            course of developments which Pakistanis now believe running in their
                            favor, we will inevitably be held responsible for next crisis in

                        <p>At a meeting of the National Security Council on May 12, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> led off his survey of key
                            world developments affecting United States security with a discussion of
                            the Pushtunistan crisis: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Director of Central Intelligence pointed out that the
                                    ultimatum which Pakistan had sent to Afghanistan would expire
                                    this coming Sunday. The ultimatum indicated that if Afghanistan
                                    had not made restitution for the attack on the Pakistan Embassy
                                    in Kabul, Pakistan would take ‘the necessary measures’. The
                                    Minister of the Interior of Pakistan had indicated that ‘the
                                    necessary measures’ might include the rupture of diplomatic
                                    relations with Afghanistan and the imposition of an economic
                                    blockade. The effect of the latter move would be bad from the
                                    U.S. point of view, since it would increase the already serious
                                    dependence of Afghanistan on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                        >USSR</gloss>.</p>
                                <p>“At this point the Acting Secretary of State, Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>, informed the Council
                                    that he had learned just before coming to the meeting that
                                    Pakistan and Afghanistan had accepted an offer of mediation by
                                    Iran, Iraq and other Arab states, and that Pakistan had
                                    accordingly cancelled its ultimatum.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> then
                                    indicated that the main problem centered around Prince <persName
                                        corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName>, the Prime Minister of
                                    Afghanistan, who had initially got himself far out on a limb and
                                    did not now know how to get himself off the limb without serious
                                    loss of face. This mediation might save the situation. After
                                    all, Pakistan did not really want war, and the Afghan
                                    mobilization was something of a farce. In short, no real
                                    military forces were confronting each other at the borders of
                                    the two countries.” (Memorandum of discussion at the 248th

                            Afghan–Pakistan relations had deteriorated since that time. His
                            particular interest, however, in talking with the Secretary was because
                            of his desire to understand the US Government’s attitude toward
                            Afghanistan. He said that until very recently, the United States had
                            maintained a neutral position on the Pushtunistan issues but that a few
                            weeks ago, when Afghanistan asked the United States to mediate its
                            current critical dispute with Pakistan, the American Ambassador in Kabul
                            had informed <persName corresp="#p_MZS1">King Zahir Shah</persName> that
                            the United States considered the Pushtun question an internal Pakistani
                            matter. This had come as a considerable shock to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPM1">Prince Naim</persName> and his brother Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Prince Naim</persName> declared that
                            Afghanistan’s long-range interests were entirely similar to those of the
                            United States. He recognized that the greatest overall danger to
                            Afghanistan was from the North. It was therefore of the highest
                            importance that Afghan-Pakistan relations be friendly. Afghanistan did
                            not ask for one inch of territory from Pakistan and would be quite
                            satisfied if the Pakistan Government would make it clear that at some
                            future date, perhaps ten years off, the eight million Pushtuns in
                            Pakistan would be given an opportunity to decide their own fate. If they
                            voted freely to adhere to Pakistan, Afghanistan would not raise the
                            issue again.</p>
                        <p>As evidence of Afghanistan’s high regard for the United States, he
                            recalled that Afghanistan had asked us for military assistance two or
                            three years ago, despite the strongly adverse reaction such assistance
                            would arouse in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Our refusal
                            to grant military aid <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0208"/>and our
                            refusal to mediate the Pushtunistan dispute for the reason we gave left
                            the Afghans in a quandary as to the American Government’s attitude
                            towards them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he welcomed <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Prince
                                Naim</persName>’s explanation of the Afghan position and his desire
                            for friendly relations with the United States. This desire was fully
                            reciprocated. The Secretary concurred in the high importance of good
                            relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. He said he was not informed
                            in detail on the Pushtunistan question, but he would like to urge
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Prince Naim</persName> again to assert
                            his influence toward calming the atmosphere. He said the United States
                            always stood ready to take appropriate steps towards improving relations
                            between neighbor countries in the Free World. He understood that efforts
                            at mediation were being made by fellow Moslem states.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Prince Naim</persName> said that Afghanistan
                            had accepted in full the recommendations of the Uncle of the King of
                            Saudi Arabia but that Pakistan had refused and was carrying out what
                            amounted to an economic blockade of Afghanistan.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d91fn3">On June 28, Prince Musaid, the Saudi mediator,
                                announced that his mediation efforts had failed. He stated that the
                                program for the flag ceremonies was complete and ready to be
                                implemented, but the “side issue” of reopening the consulates had
                                blocked a settlement. (Despatch 836 from Karachi, June 28;

                            could only make Afghanistan dependent on the Soviet Union, which
                            Afghanistan did not desire.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would like to look into the question at the
                            earliest opportunity. The conversation which lasted about forty minutes
                            was terminated at this point since the Secretary had another pressing
                            engagement.</p>

                                believed that the recent transit and trade negotiations with the

                            resist Soviet penetration. Afghanistan’s inland position makes it almost
                            inevitable that Afghans would turn north-ward <pb n="189"

                            be cut off. If this should occur, Pakistan would be in much worse

                                from Kabul, July 7, Ambassador Ward reported that Afghanistan had
                                recently completed a transit agreement with the Soviet Union which,
                                in the event of a Pakistani blockade, would permit nearly all Afghan
                                goods to move through the Soviet Union. This agreement, Ward
                                emphasized, “reveals <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> willingness

                            ouster.</p>
                        <p>US Government appreciates serious concern of Pakistan authorities over

                            However, question arises whether continuance of Pakistan embargo has

                            needed by Morrison–Knudsen to enable it to carry on its contract and on
                            export of fresh fruits from Kandahar area. Latter relaxation could be

                        <p>Morrison–Knudsen Corporation activities in Afghanistan must be
                            discontinued in near future if embargo of their shipments continues.
                            This company is one of chief influences which maintains Afghan

                        <p>On September 10 and 11, Afghan and Pakistani Cabinet Ministers, including
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName>, raised the

                            Kabul and Jalalabad. A Pakistani Cabinet Minister then raised the Afghan
                            flag at a ceremony on September 12 at Peshawar. Immediately after these
                            ceremonies, Pakistan and Afghanistan reopened the Consulates and trade
                            agencies.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State was pleased that the two nations had amicably
                            settled this protracted dispute. “We believe successful conclusion

                        <p>The Department has become increasingly concerned over Soviet penetration
                            into Afghanistan. The Soviet economic aid program in Afghanistan—which
                            includes the construction of a gasoline pipeline from a Soviet terminal
                            into Afghanistan, construction of grain storage elevators, paving of
                            streets and a number of other projects—is the most comprehensive Soviet
                            program of direct economic development aid in the free world.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> has taken the decision (<gloss

                            which the U.S. could adopt to counter Soviet penetration is to encourage
                            the growth of closer economic and political relations between
                            Afghanistan and Pakistan. To this end <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5409 provides that technical and economic assistance be
                            given to Afghanistan for those projects which would tend to strengthen
                            Afghanistan’s ties with Pakistan. The Secretary stated in a letter to

                            urgency of the Afghan problem required that the U.S. consider providing

                            neighboring countries together.</p>
                        <p>Up to the present, it has not been possible for the U.S. to undertake
                            such projects because of the bitter dispute between the two countries
                            arising from the anti-Pakistan riots which took place in Afghanistan at
                            the end of last March. This dispute (in contrast to the chronic
                            “Pushtunistan” difference) has now been settled through the holding of a
                            Pakistan flag raising ceremony in Kabul and an Afghan flag raising
                            ceremony in Peshawar. Relations between the two countries are now such
                            as to present an excellent opportunity to initiate discussions on
                            cooperative projects of the type envisaged in the <gloss

                            projects. These projects, estimated to cost $10 million annually over a
                            three-year period, include establishment of a free port and improvement
                            of harbor facilities in Karachi, furnishing additional equipment for
                            Pakistan railways to facilitate transit of Afghanistan goods,
                            improvement of the road between the Pakistan border and Kabul, and
                            development of an international airline linking Kabul with Karachi and
                            other cities in nearby countries. The projects would be financed from
                            the Asian Regional Fund (with the possible exception of the

                        <p>It is highly desirable that action be initiated as soon as possible to
                            move forward with the projects. While the settlement of the dispute
                            between Afghanistan and Pakistan has resulted in creation of an
                            atmosphere propitious for initiation of projects requiring cooperation
                            between the two countries, this atmosphere could quickly deteriorate.
                            Moreover, Communist action in agreeing to provide arms for Egypt, as
                            well as offering arms to other Near Eastern countries (we have reports
                            of a Czech sale of arms to Afghanistan), would appear to indicate
                            increased Soviet efforts to extend its <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193"

                            the form of a letter of his own drafting and asked that it be brought to

                            Afghan-Pakistan relations had again become critical with the
                            promulgation of “One Unit” in West Pakistan without prior consultation
                            between the Afghan and Pakistan Prime Ministers. Having in mind “the
                            enormous prestige of the President” and the confidence with which the
                            United States is regarded by both governments, the King of Afghanistan
                            had wished to call this situation to the President’s attention and to
                            express the hope that the U.S. would not withhold its efforts to bring
                            about friendly relations between the two nations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary undertook to bring the King’s message to the President’s
                            attention as soon as possible. He pointed out that, owing to the state
                            of his health, the President was only able to attend to a limited volume
                            of business, chiefly on matters the background of which was already
                            familiar to him.<note n="2" xml:id="d98fn2">In telegram 250 to Kabul,

                                    point out that talks have been held periodically for 8 years

                        <p>The problem is to determine what action the United States Government

                        <p>It is, of course, impossible to decide definitely on U.S. policy until
                            after the receipt of the King’s reply. If the past attitude of the
                            Afghan Government regarding the U.S. role in the Pushtunistan dispute
                            can be considered as a guide, however, it is anticipated that the King
                            in his reply will request the United States Government to utilize its
                            influence with the Pakistan Government to get it to agree to some
                            concession to the Afghan position regarding self-determination for the
                            Pushtu-speaking peoples resident on the Pakistan side of the border
                            between the two countries.</p>

                                Decision:</hi></p>
                        <p>One of the most important considerations affecting the U.S. as to the
                            action which it might take following the King’s reply is the <pb n="200"
                                xml:id="pg_200" facs="0222"/>evaluation of the chances that the
                            Soviet Union would increase its influence in Afghanistan to the extent
                            that it became dominant if the U.S. did not intervene with the Pakistan
                            Government in Afghanistan’s behalf. This evaluation will be a continuing
                            one affected by unfolding events such as the pending visit of <persName
                                corresp="#p_BMNA1">Bulganin</persName> and <persName

                                to visit Afghanistan on December 15 for the purpose of considering
                                additional Soviet aid to that country.</note></p>
                        <p>Perhaps the second most important consideration in determining U.S.
                            policy towards the Pushtunistan question is its effect upon our
                            relations with our close ally Pakistan. Pakistan has openly and clearly
                            allied itself, both militarily and politically, with the free world and
                            great care should be exercised to take no action that would weaken its
                            ties with the U.S. and other countries of the free world. However,
                            almost any action we may take by way of mediating the Pushtunistan
                            dispute with the hope of mollifying the Afghans will be distasteful to
                            the Pakistanis as it will involve some retreat from their position that
                            any question of the status of the Pushtuns inside Pakistan’s borders is
                            solely an internal affair and that Pushtunistan cannot be considered an
                            international question.</p>

                                influence in Afghanistan and maintaining friendly relations between
                                Pakistan and Afghanistan “were utterly impossible as long as
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName> was Prime Minister
                                and to have a direct meeting, whether successful or unsuccessful
                                might only strengthen <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName>’s

                        <p>At a meeting of the National Security Council on December 1, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> began his survey of key
                            world developments affecting United States security with a discussion of
                            the Pushtunistan crisis: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Director of Central Intelligence mentioned first the
                                    dangerous situation in Afghanistan, to which the entire
                                    intelligence community was alerted. He explained that the
                                    quarrel between Afghanistan and Pakistan had resulted in
                                    Afghanistan’s being cut off from communications by sea.
                                    Accordingly, Afghanistan was now largely dependent on routes
                                    through the Soviet Union for exports and imports. The
                                    Morrison-Knudsen people were experiencing great difficulty in
                                    getting in the materials needed for their dam project. The
                                    Afghans were attempting to force Morrison-Knudsen to import
                                    their necessary materials through the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"

                                <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said that the
                                    situation in Afghanistan was now reminiscent of that which had
                                    prevailed in Iran not so long ago. In each case there was a
                                    strong-minded Prime Minister who for the moment had been playing
                                    the Soviet game. The Afghan King seems either unable or
                                    unwilling to control Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM1"
                                        >Daud</persName>. Most recently <persName corresp="#p_DM1"
                                        >Daud</persName> had thrown out the Minister of Defense, who
                                    was strongly anti-Communist.</p>
                                <p>“The President inquired whether what was going on was the work of
                                    a single individual or of a junta. Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> replied that it was the
                                    work of a single individual, Prime Minister <persName

                                        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that the
                                    present situation had developed out of the violent feud between
                                    Afghanistan and Pakistan over the Pushtu tribes. Pakistan was
                                    firmly on the side of the West so, in the all-too <pb n="203"
                                        xml:id="pg_203" facs="0225"/>familiar pattern, Afghanistan
                                    was looking to the Soviet Union. Secretary <persName
                                        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> thought that the only
                                    solution was to achieve a settlement of the Pushtunistan
                                    problem.</p>
                                <p>“After further questions and answers, Governor <persName
                                        corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> suggested that the
                                    United States should try to mediate the quarrel between
                                    Afghanistan and Pakistan, and also provide a little more
                                    economic assistance to Afghanistan. Secretary <persName
                                        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, however, expressed
                                    doubt as to the wisdom of offering our good offices to settle
                                    this dispute, on grounds that the Afghan Government did not
                                    really appear to welcome our mediation. The President, referring
                                    to a recent letter from the King of Afghanistan, said that he
                                    presumed that if mediation were undertaken we would have to be
                                    prepared to give to Afghanistan part of the territories in
                                    Pakistan which they claim. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                                        >Stassen</persName> said that in his view if the United
                                    States did not mediate promptly, Afghanistan was likely to slip
                                    behind the Iron Curtain. The President said that he assumed that
                                    the Pakistanis were not disposed to yield an inch of their
                                    territory. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                        Dulles</persName> confirmed the correctness of this
                                    assumption, but Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                                        >Stassen</persName> pointed out that Pakistan was in
                                    desperate need of U.S. assistance and was in no position to
                                    carry on without it.” (Memorandum of discussion at the 268th

                                    and Pakistan, it was heartening to me to receive your expression
                                    of willingness to negotiate differences with your neighbor.</p>
                                <p>In my own experience I have found that much can often be gained
                                    from personal contact with leaders of other countries. Feelings

                                    and understanding established in such meetings can, I believe,
                                    create an atmosphere conducive to helpful discussion of real
                                    differences at issue. Accordingly, I am hopeful that it will
                                    prove possible for a meeting to be arranged between Your Majesty
                                    and the Governor General of Pakistan where a general exchange of
                                    views could take place. I am asking the Secretary of State to
                                    lend appropriate informal encouragement to constructive efforts
                                    to this end.</p>
                                <p>The United States Government is sincerely hopeful that the kind
                                    of high statesmanship demonstrated by both sides in settling the
                                    recent flag dispute will succeed in removing the remaining
                                    differences between Afghanistan and Pakistan, so that all
                                    energies may be devoted to achievement of social and economic

                            Pakistan not to engage in talks but as social gesture, to go hunting,
                            etc. While seeing nothing really useful in this particular proposal,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> said he had no objection
                            to that or any other Pakistan-Afghan exchange for his government is
                            interested in any measures which have even remotest chance of helping
                            resolve Pakistan-Afghan differences.</p>
                        <p>Noting that he has always sought to be frank and honest with Americans,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> said during forthcoming

                            “accept any conditions which will prejudice the independence of
                            Afghanistan”, however, <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> will be
                            favorably disposed to commercial-type agreements for strengthening
                            itself. As he had said previously, <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>
                            never was overly concerned with arms procurement, under assumption it
                            could maintain friendly relations with Pakistan. Now, however, arms for
                            defense are a necessity because of Pakistan hostile attitude. He added
                            his previous complaints about futile <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>
                            efforts to obtain arms from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> (due he
                            suspected to British opposition). He also reiterated theme that American
                            arms have encouraged Pakistan aggressiveness against Afghan.</p>
                        <p>Describing this news as most unfortunate, Embassy Counselor<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d105fn4"><persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Armin H.

                                >GOA</gloss> had in its relations with Pakistan reached fork in
                            road, with two possible courses—conciliation and militancy—and decision
                            apparently has already been made to take latter course. An arms deal
                            with Soviet bloc during visit Soviet leaders, Counselor said, will be
                            construed by whole world as clear evidence that Afghanistan is becoming
                            Soviet satellite.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> replied that arms were merely
                            for self-defense and no one could believe that small Afghanistan could
                            commit aggression on Pakistan. As for satellite status, <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> leaders would never concur.</p>
                        <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0229"/>
                        <p>Counselor said it was not matter of what <gloss target="#t_GOA1"
                                >GOA</gloss> leaders had in mind but rather intentions of Soviets.
                            Eyes of world will be on <persName corresp="#p_BMNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> visit this week. If visit is highlighted by
                            arms deal, as well as probable Soviet statements supporting Afghan
                            claims re Pushtunistan, whole world will be led to believe that Soviets
                            are “using Afghans” preparing another Korea in this country. He should
                            know by this time that Soviet arms offer as well as any Soviet
                            statements re Pushtunistan are not made because of Soviet love for
                            Pushtuns or Afghans but are obviously designed to exacerbate
                            Pakistan–Afghan troubles for ultimate benefit of Soviet imperialism. In
                            a sense, <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> by insistence on extremism
                            re Pushtunistan seems about to destroy Afghanistan itself and
                            facilitates Soviet expansion to this whole part of Asia.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> insisted outside world,
                            including Washington, would have no right to consider arms deal as
                            anything but simple uncomplicated matter of <gloss target="#t_GOA1"
                                >GOA</gloss> self-defense. With Pakistan having unsheathed sword, he
                            asked, could anybody dispute its right to use small knife? Counselor
                            repeated that arms deal at present would be universally interpreted that
                                <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> has decided to resort to
                            military means to settle its affair with Pakistan. This to say least is
                            not conducive to conciliation which King’s letter suggested nor to
                            favorable conditions for talks which President had solemnly expressed an
                            interest in encouraging. Least <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> could
                            do was to hold off on arms deal, and try door which President’s letter
                            opens.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName>’s attitude reflects clearly
                            that highest government decision has been made to enter arms deal with
                            Soviet bloc, probably during <persName corresp="#p_BMNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> visit. Counselor did not specifically state
                            that arms deal would cancel President’s gesture, but implication was
                            strong that such action by <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> will
                            render successful talks most difficult.</p>
                        <p>Although some may criticize this seemingly last-minute <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> effort, Embassy believes President’s
                            letter was most timely. It should have some effect, but even if it does
                            not no one including Afghans can ever say we did not try to save this
                            country. Admittedly latter thought is small consolation.</p>

                                a “poor investment for US support”; he admitted, however, that

                                substantial risks and urged the Department to weigh carefully all

                                    two years this Mission, Embassy Karachi and Department have
                                    indulged in great deal wishful thinking re (1) imminent downfall
                                        <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName> and (2) alleged
                                    split in Royal family, with King and his uncles supposedly
                                    leading a moderate group in significant opposition to <persName

                                <p>With regard to (1) <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName> has
                                    withstood all pressures brought to bear on him and emerged each
                                    time stronger than before. Recent Pakistan blockade offers
                                    particularly noteworthy example in this regard. In May, Embassy
                                    believed (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 635) that if

                                    qua non of joint US–Pakistan policy only and all-out effort
                                    including threat complete US withdrawal might have 50–50 chance
                                    success. Embassy of opinion chances of success now even less.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName> now has

                                    presumably would have given him scope to exercise his vaunted

                                    have any Pakistan agents since just before flag settlement in
                                    September. It was at that time that Pakistan Chargé got
                                    impression that <persName corresp="#p_MZS1">Shah
                                        Mahmoud</persName> could replace <persName corresp="#p_DM1"
                                        >Daud</persName>. No doubt <persName corresp="#p_MZS1">Shah
                                        Mahmoud</persName> would like premiership but he has given

                                <p>To summarize <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName>’s present
                                    position then, Embassy and most observers are of opinion that he
                                    is in position of unprecedented strength. Given conditions as
                                    they exist in this virtual police state, where there is no free
                                    press, no political parties and where ruthless suppression of
                                    minorities is the accepted pattern, such opposition as does
                                    exist against <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName> is
                                    inarticulate, uncohesive, leaderless and impotent.</p>
                                <p>In view of above it seems highly unrealistic for US or Pakistan
                                    to pursue courses of action which are colored by thought in the
                                    back of our minds that <persName corresp="#p_DM1"
                                        >Daud</persName> is about to fall. Unless US is prepared to

                                    in times past, any attacks by foreigners to strengthen his
                                    position further. His great energy, as evidenced by his public
                                    works developments, whereby he can show spectacular (for this
                                    country) achievements, will continue to temper his local
                                    unpopularity. He is stubborn, and if needled, is fully capable
                                    of jumping from Pakistan frying pan into Soviet fire while his
                                    unhappy people stand by helplessly as witnessed. Therefore,
                                    unless <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is willing to take

                                    encourage Pakistanians to base theirs on such tenuous hopes
                                    would certainly be a mistake which could cost us

                            one for Washington decision. For obvious reasons, no mention was made of

                        <p>Almost as though completely surprised that <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> should be concerned over Soviet-Afghan deal, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> declared at least half-dozen times
                            that deal was “absolutely without any political conditions or
                            implications”. It was purely long-term credit arrangement, he said,
                            similar to Export Import Bank loans, and imposed no unreasonable terms.
                            As usual, he protested vigorously against mere thought that Afghanistan
                            could ever be Soviet satellite, and said whole world will be wrong in
                            assuming Afghanistan is now on side of Soviets. <gloss target="#t_GOA1"
                                >GOA</gloss>’s policy, he said, is clearly and firmly one of
                            neutrality. At same time, he said unless <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> stands by Afghanistan, there is little, if any, hope of
                            preventing this country from being brought into Soviet sphere. He
                            pleaded “earnestly” that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would
                            continue its aid and particularly its efforts to facilitate
                            Pakistan–Afghan rapprochement. Upon questioning, he said no arms
                            agreement was made but he reiterated that <gloss target="#t_GOA1"
                                >GOA</gloss> is definitely going to purchase arms.</p>

                        <p>Department assumes you will wish take maximum advantage of present air of
                            apologetic friendliness now prevailing Kabul. Noting our appreciation

                            expression continued willingness use any means achieve peaceful
                            settlement. We sincerely hope both sides will observe conciliatory

                            hopes for high level meetings between two at earliest possible moment.
                            Obviously talks to be successful will require moderate and careful
                            formulation of position both sides and demonstration beforehand that
                            talks entered into in good faith.</p>

                            to visit Karachi at earliest possible moment. Believe terms of

                            and without specific exclusion question Pushtoonistan as possible item.
                            They should also be warned we fear benefits proposed high level talks
                            would be dissipated if instead half-hearted effort were made to hold
                            lower level exchange at something like Atik–Shah level where almost
                            inevitable failure would effectively discredit whole concept of

                                acceptance of extensive Soviet aid is motivated by his desire to

                                Western material aid and political support—attempting to use the
                                threat of growing Soviet ties as leverage. Afghan leaders probably
                                underestimate the degree to which economic connections, technical
                                aid, intimate diplomatic and cultural contacts, and the like, can be
                                used under Communist direction to tighten the bonds between

                                efforts but also on the timeliness of Western offers of
                                countervailing support or Western willingness to bail them out if

                                remain strained. However, neither side is likely to provoke
                                hostilities deliberately. Pakistan’s concern over growing Soviet

                                its relations with the Afghans, but it is highly unlikely to make
                                any real concessions on the Pushtunistan question. (Paras.

                                the Soviet Bloc as their only source of economic assistance and
                                political support against Pakistan. In neither event are the Afghans
                                likely to abandon the Pushtunistan issue, and [the] US could not
                                support Afghanistan in this controversy without alienating Pakistan.

                            <item>If Western support of the “northern tier” concept should be
                                stepped up, and particularly if the US should adhere to the Baghdad
                                Pact, Soviet attempts to counter these developments probably would
                                include increased efforts to insure Afghanistan’s orientation toward
                                the Bloc. Should US bases be established in Pakistan or Iran the
                                Soviets would probably seek to gain control over Afghan foreign and
                                military policy. However, the character of Soviet actions would be
                                conditioned by the attitude of India and other neutral states of the
                                Middle and Far East. (Para. 30)</item>

                        <p>Between January 30 and February 1, a high-level delegation of British
                            officials met with American representatives in Washington to discuss
                            recent international developments. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> and Secretary of State <persName

                            officials during the talks while British Prime Minister <persName

                            Selwyn Lloyd led an 8-member British delegation. One matter that
                            received particular attention during the conversations was the joint
                            interests and objectives of the two countries in South and Southeast
                            Asia in light of the new Soviet activity in that area. During discussion
                            of that subject on January 31, <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> raised the issue of deteriorating relations between
                            Pakistan and Afghanistan: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>

                                    originally agreed between the British Government as the frontier
                                    between the Indian Empire and Afghanistan, Pakistan, as one of
                                    the successor states to the Empire, is entitled to have the same
                                    frontier. The Prime Minister <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220"

                                    on this matter upon his return to the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                        >UK</gloss>. He wondered whether the United States
                                    Government would also be in a position to say something on this
                                    matter. Perhaps it could come up at one of Secretary <persName

                                    Prime Minister added that his information is that the Russians
                                    have available 5,000 tanks and 4,000 aircraft from their surplus
                                    stores which they can offer to various countries to stir up
                                    trouble.</p>
                                <p>“The Secretary replied that Assistant Secretary <persName

                                    meeting this afternoon and that he, the Secretary, was not
                                    informed of all of the details of the subject under discussion.
                                    He added, however, that he understood there was a meeting
                                    scheduled between the Governor General of Pakistan and the King
                                    of Afghanistan for next May. He wondered whether, if the US and
                                    the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> were both to reaffirm at
                                    this time their support of the present frontier between Pakistan
                                    and Afghanistan, this might not have adverse effect on the
                                    Afghans and make the Pakistanis too cocky on the eve of the
                                    forthcoming talks. In any case, the Secretary said, he would
                                    look into this matter.</p>

                            of the Afghan situation.<note n="2" xml:id="d113fn2">The Secretary had
                                an earlier conversation with the Pakistani Prime Minister and
                                Governor General regarding Afghanistan on March 5. During that

                                and <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> expressed their
                                fear of the serious threat to Pakistan posed by the Soviet Union, as
                                a result of the latter’s provision of arms and supplies to
                                Afghanistan. The Prime Minister asked <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                    >Dulles</persName> for U.S. recognition of the Durand Line as
                                the international boundary between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The
                                Secretary replied that time did not allow an extensive discussion of
                                these issues but remarked that “while he did not pose as an

                                Afghanistan, he wondered whether Pakistan’s action in refusing to
                                allow goods to transit Pakistan enroute to Afghanistan had not
                                tended to force Afghans to look toward the North.” He also indicated
                                that he was anxious to have further talks regarding this subject
                                during his stay in Karachi. (Memorandum of conversation by <persName

                                entered into diplomatic relations with Pakistan in 1947.</note></p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed his thanks for what had been said in <gloss

                            approached the reporting officer at the reception held the same evening
                            with the request that the Secretary be informed of his extreme gratitude
                            at the action taken by the U.S. and other Council Representatives. He
                            said that he had not been fully informed as to the nature of the
                            morning’s proceedings which dealt with Kashmir and the Durand Line and
                            that had he known what had been said, he would have been much more
                            gracious in his thanks and probably have spent more time on examining
                            future courses of action.)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that he did not like to concede that Afghanistan
                            was bound to become a Soviet satellite and that he was afraid that the
                            Prime Minister and his colleagues in Pakistan took this too much for
                            granted.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then stated that he thought that the deterioration of
                            the situation had come about because of one man only, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName>, the Prime Minister of Afghanistan.
                            The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has played on <persName
                                corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName>’s ambitions and has been aided and
                            abetted by India in the process. The Prime Minister wished the facts
                            were otherwise and did not like the situation at all. The Pakistanis
                            were prepared to make every reasonable effort to improve the situation.
                            He did not have much faith in the outcome of the projected visit of the

                            successful. He was willing to try economic collaboration. He pointed out
                            that it was after he became Prime Minister last August that the <gloss

                            transit shipments and restore normal trade relations. The facts point
                            out that Russia and India are meddling in the situation. When they talk
                            to Americans and British, the Afghans’ position is <pb n="222"
                                xml:id="pg_222" facs="0244"/>that they are being forced into an
                            alliance with the Russians. In this they are patently insincere.
                            Pakistan could not stand attacks on its territory. The Prime Minister
                            referred to certain maps published in Afghanistan indicating that the
                            projected state of Pushtoonistan would embrace the entire northern and
                            western areas of Pakistan on the right bank of the Indus River. This
                            proposal made no sense whatsoever. The Afghans wish to unsettle an area
                            which is by and large a settled and stable one. He pointed out that the
                            Pakistani control of the tribes is a loose one, that the tribes abide by
                            their own laws and that Pakistan collects no taxes nor revenue from
                            them. On the contrary, Pakistan is spending money on their education and
                            economic development projects in general. The Prime Minister pointed out
                            that a substantial number of tribesmen are armed, and that if Russia is
                            allowed to stir up trouble, an explosion could result. During the
                            British occupation of India large forces had been maintained in the
                            North West Frontier Province. Despite the fact that Pakistan maintains
                            small forces—much smaller than the British—there had been eight years of
                            tranquility until <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName> became
                            Prime Minister. The bulk of the Afghans hate communism, hate the
                            Russians and pray for Pakistan in their mosques. Thousands come from
                            Afghanistan to Pakistan every winter. All the present trouble has been
                            caused by the mad desire of Afghanistan’s rulers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> then inquired why if
                            this problem was a century old the removal of <persName corresp="#p_DM1"
                                >Daud</persName> was the key to its solution.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister replied that it might be difficult to be rid of the
                            problem entirely, but that the uncles of the Prime Minister and other
                            important Afghans are most unhappy at the course he is taking. He quoted
                            the former Afghan Ambassador to Pakistan, Rafiq Attik, who before his
                            departure from Karachi said to the Prime Minister, “We are foolish
                            people and shall commit suicide.” The totalitarian regime prevents
                            people in Afghanistan from expressing their dissatisfaction with the
                            course of the Government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked where power rested in Afghanistan.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister replied that sources of power rested on the Army, and
                            on fear. The Afghans who objected to the course of the Government were
                            put in prison. Great trouble, however, was likely because of the
                            Russians who could direct an attack on Pakistan through Afghanistan
                            without being directly involved. Under the circumstances, Pakistan and
                            her allies must exert themselves to the utmost.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then inquired how endeavors on our part could best be
                            directed, pointing out that the policy of Pakistan would probably make
                            certain that a bad result would ensue.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister replied by giving the history of eight years of <gloss
                                target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>-Afghan relationships. Throughout the
                            entire time, Pakistan <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0245"/>had been
                            patient with the Afghans despite much criticism of the Government’s
                            course within Pakistan. Pakistan stopped an intensive series of raids in
                            1950–51. The Afghan Government, however, continued throughout its
                            vicious propaganda, and things came to a head in March when the Afghans
                            sacked the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> Embassy at Kabul, and the
                            Consulate at Jalalabad, as a protest against the proposed establishment
                            of the single administrative unit for West Pakistan. This was an
                            unprecedented action, and Pakistan naturally retaliated by slowing down
                            transit trade. The eventual settlement was carried out in a generous
                            spirit by Pakistan, which was not reciprocated, and thereafter the
                            Russians in consultation with the Afghans and with authorities in Delhi
                            entered the scene. Under the circumstances, he feared that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GG1">GG</gloss>’s visit would have a negative result,
                            that the King was weak and would not oppose his brother, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName>, and thereafter it would only be a
                            matter of months before hostilities began. Therefore, something should
                            be done quickly before <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName>
                            becomes stronger and the Russian grasp stronger.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what it should be.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister replied that we should leave no doubt in any minds
                            regarding the Durand Line, and that the U.S. would come to the aid of
                            Pakistan if Pakistan were attacked. Then the Afghans might realize that
                            blackmail did not pay. If the Afghans were given only one option, that
                            of joining with Russia fully, the people of Afghanistan might be able to
                            bring the rulers to their senses. The Prime Minister also pointed out
                            that tribal people respect strength rather than weakness.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> pointed out that what
                            the Prime Minister was requesting was not only to recognize the frontier
                            of Pakistan but to guarantee it. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>
                            had done this for India for a couple of centuries but, the peoples of
                            India had asked the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> to leave.
                            Pakistan should realize their independence involves responsibilities of
                            sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>In response, the Prime Minister indicated that he understood the
                            responsibilities of independence and that Pakistan is prepared to face
                            difficulties. However, the difficulties arose not alone from Afghanistan
                            but from Russian attitudes. If the Afghans alone were concerned, the
                            Pakistanis could handle the situation easily.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> pointed out that arms
                            available to Afghanistan from the Soviets were not comparable to the
                            assistance given by the U.S. to Pakistan, and that the Russians seemed
                            primarily to be working on an economic program in Afghanistan. The Prime
                            Minister replied that in the economic programs, neither the airfields
                            nor the roads were without military significance, and that the
                            information available to Pakistan was that $40,000,000 of the Russian
                            line of credit was available for arms.</p>
                        <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0246"/>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that Russian aid to Afghanistan appeared to be
                            rather less than that furnished by the U.S. and observed that the Prime
                            Minister did not appear to have a constructive program for handling the
                            Afghan problem.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister replied that there had always been the fullest
                            exchange of thoughts on the Afghan problem with the Embassy here and
                            that the Pakistanis had heeded our advice in the past and would welcome
                            our advice in the future.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then inquired of the Prime Minister as to his opinion on
                            the exchange of correspondence between the King and the President. He
                            wondered whether he was aware of the letters written by the King.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister observed that the Royal Family of Afghanistan had an
                            exceptional technique of reputed division within their own ranks; one
                            would be pro-Russian; one would be pro-Free World. This made a most
                            useful working partnership.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked what Pakistan would like us to tell the
                            Afghans.</p>
                        <p>In reply the Prime Minister thought that they should be told straight
                            that they must play either with us or with the Russians. Nothing would
                            please the Pakistanis more than to have the Afghans opt for the Free
                            World, through a decision to join the Baghdad Pact, and to follow the
                            democracies in other ways. It was unfortunate that the present regime
                            prevented the Afghans from expressing their true pro-Western
                            feelings.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said it appeared to him that the Pakistanis had lost
                            hope in the situation and in effect that they were saying that the case
                            was a lost one and that Afghanistan would inevitably become a Soviet
                            satellite. He observed that this was bound to be a threat both to Iran
                            and Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister stated that the only hope was to change the
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> pointed out that this
                            might buy time, but that the problem would persist.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the British had been very successful during
                            their occupation in staving off the real problem, that of Russian
                            maneuvering.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> suggested an active
                            program on Pakistan’s part of improving living standards in the border
                            area. This might encourage the tribes to turn more and more to Karachi,
                            rather than to Kabul.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HHA1">Hildreth</persName> stated that
                            improving living standards had resulted in demands of the tribes on the
                            Afghan Government which might be partly a cause of the Afghan
                            Government’s resentful attitudes to Pakistan.</p>
                        <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0247"/>
                        <p>The Prime Minister again said that the case had only become serious since
                            Russian intervention.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that he for one did not believe in quitting in a
                            case like this. He wanted a program to save Afghanistan from Soviet
                            control. He did not want to miss any opportunity, and he thought there
                            must be a way to solve this problem in view of the hostility between
                                <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName> and the King and the
                            hostility in the tribes. The Russians are really not doing very much
                            yet, and are not helping the tribes in the southern part of the country.
                            A way must be found to do something constructive.</p>
                        <p>In reply, the Prime Minister stated that it was most important that the
                            Afghans know our attitude, and understand that blackmail would not
                            pay.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that under certain circumstances there might be a
                            justification for using our funds in such a situation. He gave an
                            example of Yugoslavia where our assistance caused unrest among other
                            satellites of Russia. If resources were made available to the Afghans,
                            their use might stop, or delay, Afghan absorption by Russia, and it
                            therefore might be worthwhile to carry out assistance programs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> pointed out that if we
                            stopped all aid to Afghanistan, the Afghans would most likely have to
                            turn to the Russians.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then said “Tell us what is wrong with the Pakistani
                            position and we will modify it.” On the other hand, if it were the
                            opinion of the U.S. that Pakistan has no aggressive designs (Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> agreed that this was
                            the case) then the U.S. should help support Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then concluded the interview as he had another engagement,
                            ending it with an expression of hope that a way out could be found.</p>

                        <p>Pursuant to the plea the Governor General made the day previous,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and I had
                            breakfast with the Governor General and his wife on the morning of the
                            Secretary’s departure and just prior to the Secretary’s private
                            conference with the Shah of Iran. In the mingled social and political
                            conversation, the important points touched are as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Afghanistan:</hi> The Secretary said it did not make
                            much sense to just sit around doing nothing and let Afghanistan pass by
                            default into the control of the Soviets. On the other hand, the
                            Secretary said it would seem to be up to Pakistan to come up with some
                            specific plans with some evidence that they might be capable of
                            execution in a way that would achieve desirable results. The Governor
                            General said he thought the best thing to do was to wait until he went
                            to Kabul and he thought then he could really find out what the situation
                            was and what prospects there might be for activity. He said he did not
                            expect to get much from the King, but the King’s uncle, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MZS1">Shah Mahmoud</persName>, was an old and good
                            friend of his and he hoped he might get much favorable information from
                            him. He also indicated he had other long standing friends from whom he
                            could get helpful information. On the other hand, he said we, meaning
                            the American Embassy in Karachi, had indicated that the information from
                            our Embassy in Kabul was to the effect that the invitation he had been
                            expecting from the King to visit Kabul had not been forthcoming because
                            they were waiting for the result of the Presidential election.<note

                        <p>We spoke of the situation in Afghanistan and the possible threat that it
                            might become a Soviet satellite and carry on military activities against
                            Pakistan much as in the Korea or Indochina style claiming to liberate
                            the Pakhtoonistans. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> spoke
                            rather sharply and with some evidence of irritation saying that this
                            whole trouble was of the making of the Pakistanis. They had been
                            arbitrary in their relations and had imposed an economic blockade on
                            Afghanistan. It was inevitable that under these circumstances the
                            Afghans should get assistance by or through the Soviet Union or
                            otherwise they would perish. I said that while as a result of incidents
                            there had been a temporary closing of the Pakistan frontier, it had been
                            of only a brief duration and was now all over. Also I said the
                            information we have was that the Soviets were supplying arms as well as
                            economic goods. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> said that
                            he had had no information that the frontier had been reopened. (From
                            this and other discussions, I got very clearly the impression that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> feels so emotionally
                            about the Pakistanis that he automatically attributes to them the <pb
                                n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0250"/>blame for everything that goes
                            wrong in the area. He does not seem to be open to much reason or
                            independent study of the facts where Pakistan is involved.)</p>

                                    offers of aid in attempt outbid Soviets would have generally

                                    forward first with regional projects in order to test

                                summarized its chief points, concluding that while the fact and the
                                language of the protest were unwelcome, it was obviously a
                                “face-saving move” by the Afghans. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1"

                                apparent desire to proceed with plans for the proposed meeting
                                between the Afghan King and Pakistani President were actions which
                                spoke louder than words. (Department of State, Central Files,

                            Ludin that he had accompanied Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"

                            his impressions of the way in which the matter had been discussed. He
                            personally had hoped that the Durand Line question could have been
                            avoided altogether by the conference. However, the <persName

                            (Ludin affirmed this), had made it appear necessary for <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> to “set the record straight” so
                            that there might be no misunderstandings. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> emphasized that the position
                            taken by the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> conferees was taken
                            “severally”. As he recalled, Australia had been the first to express its
                            view, and then it had developed that each of the countries represented
                            also recognized the Durand Line as the Afghanistan–Pakistan border. This
                            particular sector of the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                            perimeter was singled out for clarification because it was the only
                            sector which had been called into question.</p>
                        <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0253"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> called attention to the
                            sentence in the fourth paragraph of the Afghan note to the effect that
                            the Afghan stand is based on post-partition developments in the Indian
                            subcontinent. Although Ludin explicitly confirmed this statement, he
                            repeatedly referred to pre-partition aspects of the question in the
                            general discussion which followed.</p>
                        <p>Asked whether Afghanistan would accept the adherence of Pushtunistan if
                            the Pushtuns themselves voted to join Afghanistan, Ludin responded
                            emphatically in the negative. It was Afghanistan’s belief, he said, that
                            if Pushtunistan were independent, there would then be no issue to
                            prevent close solidarity among Afghanistan, Pushtunistan, and West
                            Pakistan; they would become virtually a single entity. When Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> pointed out that the
                            Pushtunistan idea was not very practical since there was no local de
                            facto government capable of assuming responsibility for maintaining
                            stability in the area, Ludin made no direct rejoinder.</p>
                        <p>During a discussion of the legal aspects of the question of sovereignty
                            over the disputed area, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>
                            observed that in cases where real estate ownership was in dispute and
                            neither party held a deed, one factor usually taken into consideration
                            was the intention of the previous holder of clear title. In the case of
                            Pushtunistan, Britain had previously exercised authority over the area,
                            and it appeared from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s
                            recent statement in Commons<note n="5" xml:id="d117fn5">On March 1,

                            intended to convey its “ownership” of Pushtunistan to Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>Ludin expressed great personal concern over the situation in Afghanistan,
                            and voiced the hope that the U.S. would do something to halt present
                            trends. Pushtunistan tensions seemed to be self-aggravating, and the
                            situation of Afghanistan was causing Ludin to lose sleep. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> replied that he hoped the
                            prospective <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName>–<persName
                                corresp="#p_MZS1">Zahir</persName> talks would improve the
                            situation, although he was aware that such talks sometimes produced
                            negative results.</p>
                        <p>Ludin expressed the hope the Department would make an official response
                            to the Afghan protest note; he appreciated Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>’s personal explanations, but
                            feared that it would be improper for him to report them as representing
                            the U.S. position. He might be suspected in Kabul of attempting to put
                            too good a face on the American position, and he wanted to be sure he
                            was reporting the <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0254"/>official U.S.

                                    previously exercised responsibility over the area. By its

                        <p>Apropos of Afghanistan, our policy toward which presently would be the
                            subject of Council discussion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">[Allen]
                                Dulles</persName> pointed out that there was no doubt that the
                            Soviets were making a major effort to extend their influence over that
                            country. Visas had been recently issued for the entry of several hundred
                            Soviet technicians into Afghanistan. Some $30 to $60 million of the $100
                            million loan recently made by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            to Afghanistan had already been allocated among thirteen different
                            projects. As yet, however, nobody knew how much, if any, money had been
                            spent. In addition, truckloads of small arms were entering Afghanistan
                            from the Soviet Union. While the Soviets could not yet be said to have
                            taken over Afghanistan and might not be able to do so, as long as
                            Afghanistan was cut off from the West by its feud with Pakistan,
                            Afghanistan would turn more and more to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            noted that some hope of a settlement of the quarrel between Afghanistan
                            and Pakistan attached to the forthcoming visit of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> of Pakistan to Kabul. After
                            discussing the projects for the development of airlines and airports in
                            Afghanistan, and the rivalry between the United States and the <gloss

                            that the United States try at least to maintain an air foothold in

                            Afghanistan. In concluding, he pointed out the Planning Board’s feeling
                            that there were very severe limitations on the capability of the United
                            States to counter Soviet maneuvers in Afghanistan. (A copy of Mr.

                        <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> had finished,
                            the President asked if anyone had anything to say on the subject.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> replied that the
                            newly proposed paragraph 56–A of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5409, which warned against undertaking an economic program matching in
                            size and scope that of the Soviet Union, was not intended by its authors
                            to exclude continued economic developmental assistance to Afghanistan.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> reassured the
                            Secretary of State that this paragraph was not intended to exclude
                            economic developmental assistance to Afghanistan.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> called attention
                            to the figures in the Financial Appendix to the revised policy
                            statement, indicating that the United States estimated possible
                            expenditures in the years 1958 and 1959 for economic assistance to
                            Afghanistan of up to $12 million in each year. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> wondered whether it was wise
                            to make commitments of this size for a period so far ahead.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed, and stated that he did not see how we could
                            estimate such commitments until we had determined how such funds were
                            actually to be spent in Afghanistan. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> added the view that the United
                            States could really do nothing for Afghanistan until the latter’s
                            quarrel with Pakistan had finally been settled.</p>
                        <p>In response to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                            the quarrel between Afghanistan and Pakistan had already been going on
                            for hundreds for years, to which Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> added, thousands of years. Accordingly,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> doubted the <pb
                                n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0257"/>wisdom of waiting upon a
                            settlement of the feud before trying to do something to save
                            Afghanistan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> pointed out that the
                            International Cooperation Administration was trying to do what it could
                            to see that the Helmand Valley project was effectively completed. If the
                            Morrison-Knudsen Company fails on this job, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> predicted that the U.S.
                            Government would be blamed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> said that the Helmand Valley project seemed to be
                            a kind of white elephant on our hands.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> thought that we
                            should strongly back the efforts of Pan American Airlines to fly in and
                            out of Afghanistan, even though this course of action did not fall
                            within the category of economic aid called for in the new paragraph
                            56–A, which recommended projects which would provide “immediately
                            visible evidence of continued U.S. friendship" for Afghanistan. Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> suggested the
                            addition of new language to paragraph 56–A to take account of such
                            projects as the Pan American. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1"
                                >Hollister</persName> replied that it might be better to consider
                            backing the Dutch <gloss target="#t_KLM1">KLM</gloss> Airways in their
                            efforts to fly into Afghanistan. <gloss target="#t_KLM1">KLM</gloss>
                            appeared more willing than Pan American to put up the necessary funds to
                            accomplish this objective, and besides, it might be better for an ally
                            of the United States, rather than the United States itself, to attempt
                            to secure an air foothold in Afghanistan. Both the President and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> thought Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>’s suggestion a good
                            one. Accordingly, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>
                            said he would try to find out how serious the Dutch were in the pursuit
                            of the <gloss target="#t_KLM1">KLM</gloss> enterprise. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> noted that arrangements had
                            already been concluded between Afghanistan and the <gloss

                            between Moscow and Kabul. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                                >Anderson</persName> assured the Council that there was nothing in
                            the newly recommended courses of action which would be at variance with
                            the airline proposals.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> expressed the
                            view that the free world had less than a fifty-fifty chance of keeping
                            Afghanistan out of the Soviet orbit ….</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> commented that he
                            had discussed the situation of the Afghan Government with high Pakistani
                            officials during his recent visit to Karachi. He had observed two
                            divergent lines of thinking among the Pakistani. One group thought that
                            the situation in Afghanistan could be improved by peaceful means. On the
                            other hand, President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName>
                            thought that a coup would be necessary to clear up the situation.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> added that he would
                            try further to size up the situation of Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName> in the course of his forthcoming
                            visit to Kabul. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            believed that <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> would
                            probably seek U.S. assistance when he made his decision after the visit

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> inquired about
                            the assets of Afghanistan and whether the country had any significant
                            natural resources. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                                >Hoover</persName> replied that important oil deposits had been
                            discovered, as well as deposits of uranium.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> stated his belief
                            that it was essential that a program be worked out among Iran, Pakistan
                            and Afghanistan if the latter were to be saved from the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> added that he had talked about this situation
                            with the <persName corresp="#p_MZS1">Shah</persName> of Iran when he was
                            last in the Middle East, and the <persName corresp="#p_MZS1"
                                >Shah</persName> had told him that unfortunately Iran’s relations
                            with Afghanistan were not very close. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> expressed grave doubt as to
                            the efficacy of increased U.S. economic assistance to Afghanistan ….</p>
                        <p>The President observed that if there was one sentiment universally abroad
                            in the world today, it was the sentiment of nationalism. Accordingly,
                            the only course of action for the United States was to stress the
                            significance of nationalism and to make clear to the Afghans that they
                            will lose their national identity if they continue to go along with the
                            plans of the Soviet Union. If they should do so, we should point out
                            that they would become simply another Tibet. Nationalism and the Moslem
                            religion, repeated the President, were the only real influences in
                            Afghanistan on which we could base our hopes. The United States could
                            certainly not compete for Afghanistan with the Soviet Union in the
                            economic sphere.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> expressed
                            agreement with the President’s view, but Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that if Afghanistan was
                            unable to get along with its immediate neighbors, it was unlikely to get
                            along with the United States.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Discussion of this item closed with a warning from Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> against too great pessimism in
                            our assessment of the situation in Afghanistan. Governor <persName

                            British India. For example in conversation with Court Minister May 21, I
                            stated I could not conceive that Pakistan, which has several languages
                            and racial groups, would commit suicide by agreeing to let one or
                            another group split off, and that India was in same situation. In fact,
                            I stated, it seemed to me that Afghanistan also would face crisis if
                            Uzbeks, Hazaras, and Iranians, for example, suddenly demanded separation
                            and perhaps union with similar racial and linguistic elements across

                        <p>The Finance Minister stated that the Government of Pakistan was quite
                            concerned over the situation in Afghanistan. The <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                                >GOP</gloss> had information that Soviet agents were active among
                            the tribes in the Frontier, including those on the Pakistan side. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> feels that the situation is
                            quite dangerous. The Secretary queried the Finance Minister on the
                            payments to the tribes, traditional from British days and the Finance
                            Minister said that they were paying the tribes exactly what the British
                            had paid them and in addition they were building schools and roads in
                            the area and giving other economic assistance, including a dam at
                            Warsak, in which project the Canadians are helping. The Secretary
                            remarked that our information indicated that the Government of
                            Afghanistan is not pro-Communist. As a matter of fact they appeared to
                            be most interested in the President’s Middle East Plan and may ask us
                            for assurances under the Plan. The Secretary added he was not certain we
                            could give them such assurances; that this would be stretching the
                            Middle East very far. <persName corresp="#p_ASA1">Amjad Ali</persName>
                            said that the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> had done almost
                            everything it could to better relations with Afghanistan, but so far
                            their efforts had been in vain. They had tried to discuss the transit
                            problem with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Daud</persName>,
                            but that his only reply was that before he could discuss the transit
                            problem the matter of Pushtoonistan would have to be settled. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ACM1">Ali</persName> said that they were willing to take
                            any steps even though there was divided opinion within the <gloss

                        <p>After greeting the Ambassador, the Under Secretary spoke of the
                            continuing interest of the United States in cooperating with Afghanistan
                            to develop its economy and to strengthen its independence. The
                            Ambassador replied that he deeply appreciated the statement of the Under
                            Secretary.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary then stated that we had been most pleased to see the
                            progress which had been made in solving the differences between
                            Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Ambassador commented that his Government
                            wished to settle as soon as possible its differences with its neighbor
                            to the south. The Afghan Government greatly appreciated the efforts of
                            the United States in this connection. Fortunately the problems between
                            Afghanistan and Pakistan were still under control. There were many more
                            acute problems in the world today. Nevertheless, the outstanding issues
                            between the two countries led to friction between them and it was
                            therefore highly desirable to continue the efforts to arrive at a real
                            settlement. These problems should be settled before they became more
                            difficult, and it was for this reason that the Afghan Government was so
                            grateful when the President of the United States took action last year
                            to open up new avenues for settlement.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, the Ambassador said that one of the most important steps in
                            solving the outstanding problems between the two countries was to remove
                            Pakistani suspicions of the motives of the Government of Afghanistan.
                            The problem between Afghanistan and Pakistan was not like that of
                            Kashmir, which was claimed by both parties. It was also not so serious
                            as the problem between the Israelis and the Arabs.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary expressed his pleasure at the opportunity of meeting
                            Mr. Najib-Ullah and expressed the hope that they would see each other
                            again.</p>

                                <item>I believe what we should strive for is really “neutral” Afghan
                                    on Swiss model. We should help country to extract itself from
                                    Russian fold but at cautious pace to keep down likelihood
                                    counter moves by Soviets to tighten their hold. We need also to
                                    avoid arousing on part of Afghans expectations of support which
                                    in actual crisis it would not be practical for United States to
                                    extend. During final meeting I told Afghans I fully recognized
                                    reason they desire to neutral policy and thought this best
                                    course for them. <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName>
                                    declared <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> “genuinely

                        <p>Presentation of President’s proposals to Afghans posed special
                            difficulties. We understood from discussions in State Department and
                            memo approved by Secretary March 4 as guidance for mission re
                            Afghanistan, that Department preferred to avoid clearly including or
                            excluding Afghanistan from area comprehended by Mideast proposals.
                            Inclusion would engage United States prestige and confront United States
                            with particularly difficult situation if subsequently Afghans should
                            request United States assistance against acts of aggression by
                            international communism. World situation might make it impractical for
                            United States respond, which would result in severe blow to our prestige
                            and to standing of document. On other hand exclusion would remove
                            deterrent effect versus <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and cause
                            Afghanistan to conclude it written off by United States thus damaging

                        <p>I had reached conclusion, especially in view implications stemming from
                            fact of mission visit to Afghanistan, that on balance I should state if
                            obliged to give clear-cut answer that Afghanistan included under Mideast
                            proposals. Fortunately, question not pinpointed officially by Afghans.

                            were also active in Afghanistan. The Prime Minister cited their erection
                            of a silo and their execution of other highly conspicuous projects. It
                            was important that Afghan ties with the free world be maintained, else
                            the Afghans would inevitably be pulled “in the other direction”.</p>

                            promised to tone down their propaganda on the Pushtunistan issue. It was

                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Meeting in Karachi in March and
                            your subsequent visits to other countries in South and Southeast Asia, I
                            am very much concerned with respect to the situation which is developing
                            in Ceylon. The present Government of Ceylon is one of the staunchest in
                            the entire area in terms of support of fundamental western objectives
                            and purposes. This has been demonstrated on a number of occasions in the
                            past two years—notably with respect to the position Ceylon has taken in
                            meetings of the Colombo Powers and particularly with reference to the
                            solid and staunch position the Ceylonese Prime Minister, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KSJL1">Sir John Kotelawala</persName>, took at the
                            Bandung Conference when he vigorously opposed <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou En-Lai</persName>’s various maneuvers. To summarize, the
                            present government is vigorously anti-Communist and in general shares
                            basic western objectives and purposes and is less susceptible to
                            anti-Western and “neutralist” Communist propaganda than many of the
                            other countries in the Middle East and South and Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>The present situation, as I understand it, is that because of the
                            economic facts of Ceylonese life, and the fact that they are obliged to
                            dispose of their rubber production and have been doing so by triangular
                            deals involving Communist countries, we are barred under the provisions
                            of the Battle Act<note n="3" xml:id="d132fn3">The Mutual Defense
                                Assistance Control Act, or Battle Act (named after Representative
                                Laurie C. Battle of Alabama), was approved on October 26, 1951, as
                                P. L. 213, 82d Congress. For text, see 65 Stat. 644. Under the
                                Battle Act, which forbade aid to countries exporting primary
                                strategic goods to the Soviet bloc, the United States had suspended
                                its aid to Ceylon in September 1951.</note> from extending to them
                            economic aid and assistance. This, despite the fact that we are giving
                            economic aid to neutralist India and Indonesia and are planning to help
                            finance the Aswan Dam for Egypt which has just concluded the <pb n="260"
                                xml:id="pg_260" facs="0282"/>well-known Soviet Arms deal. I, in no
                            sense, wish to imply that we should not go ahead with aid to India,
                            Indonesia, Egypt, etc., because I think we most definitely should. The
                            point I would make is that if our policy is so inflexible that we must
                            penalize a staunch Asian friend because of the economic facts of its
                            life, I fear greatly that over a period of not too much time we risk
                            seeing the present Ceylonese leadership replaced by a leadership which
                            may lead Ceylon progressively into the India-Burma way of thinking.
                            This, I think, we can ill afford, having in mind our paucity of Asian
                            friends who are staunch and dependable. If Ceylon should follow such a
                            course, it would further complicate our efforts with respect to making
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, which we launched, a
                            successful enterprise, since the Ceylonese Government is among the few
                            Asian non-members who, while not wishing at this juncture to join, have
                            not been critical of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and, on the
                            contrary, privately have tended to welcome it.</p>
                        <p>We have had recently some extremely interesting telegrams from our
                            Embassy in Ceylon supporting the above thesis and noting growing
                            resentment that Ceylon is barred from U.S. aid. Also, the location of
                            the Nuclear Research Center in Manila instead of Colombo (which had
                            hoped and expected to get it), will have an adverse affect in terms of
                            U.S. purposes and objectives with respect to Ceylon.</p>
                        <p>I would hope very much that we could take a thorough new look at the
                            Ceylonese problem, even if it required amendments to existing
                            legislation, so that we would be in a position not of discriminating
                            against a staunch friend while at the same time we are giving extensive
                            economic assistance to Governments which are either neutralist in
                            tendency or trying to play both sides off against each other. If we
                            could do something constructive for Ceylon in the economic field, I
                            think it would not only be in our enlightened self-interest with respect
                            to both Ceylon and the general area, but also create a situation where
                            your visit there would be most successful and pay substantial future
                            dividends.</p>

                        <p>I continue to be concerned about the Ceylon situation. If we locate the
                            nuclear power station in the Philippines rather than Ceylon (with which
                            I concur), if we give economic aid to India which is theoretically
                            neutralist but benevolent to the Soviet bloc, if we give economic aid to
                            Egypt which has its arms deal with the Soviet bloc, and if we cannot do
                            anything for Ceylon which has been a staunch and helpful ally, then
                            there is, I think, something seriously wrong.</p>

                        <p>As you know, the matter of opening up an aid program to Ceylon is a
                            delicate one, particularly because of the fact that through error in the
                            State Department Ceylon was informed, while the Under Secretary and I
                            were in the Far East and shortly before I arrived at Singapore for the
                            Colombo Conference, that it would be the location of the regional atomic
                            nuclear center for Asia. This involved a somewhat embarrassing
                            disentanglement which I worked out with the Ceylon representatives in
                            Singapore before I delivered the speech on the Asian nuclear center.</p>
                        <p>I am enclosing a memorandum summarizing as succinctly as I can the
                            present situation.</p>

                        <p>The matter has been somewhat complicated by the fact that on January 11 a
                            cable which was not cleared with the International Cooperation
                            Administration went to Colombo authorizing the Charge to discuss a

                            intimating that Ceylon was eligible to have half the cost of a reactor

                            <p>Since rubber is on the list of controlled items as defined in the
                                Battle Act, as long as Ceylon ships rubber to Communist China aid
                                may only be given in one of the following ways: <list>
                                    <label>a.</label>
                                    <item>Under Section 401 of the Mutual Security Act of
                                        1954;</item>
                                    <label>b.</label>
                                    <item>If rubber should be removed from the list of controlled
                                        items; or</item>
                                    <label>c.</label>
                                    <item>If Ceylon should be declared to have cooperated in the
                                        control of rubber.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>To invoke Section 401 weakens the whole control picture because other
                                countries can argue that if Ceylon can receive aid while selling
                                controlled items they should be able to do so.</p>
                            <p>To remove rubber from the controlled items will naturally encourage
                                every other rubber producing country to begin or increase its
                                present deliveries.</p>
                            <p>There therefore remains only the question of “cooperation”. Ceylon
                                probably would not break its existing contract, and if it would be
                                willing to, we are not able to offer it enough to make it
                                worthwhile. It is also probable that Ceylon would not make any
                                agreement to stop shipping rubber when this contract expires. It
                                might well agree, however, to limit its rubber shipment to the exact
                                terms of the present contract and agree to discuss the problem
                                further when its present contract expires. This could probably be
                                considered “cooperation”.</p>

                                have to answer questions as to the Battle Act, and it would seem
                                that something would have to be said about Ceylon’s cooperation.
                                This is a delicate problem with <persName corresp="#p_KSJL1">Sir
                                    John Kotelawala</persName> who would prefer to say nothing to
                                his legislature or if he has to say something, would want to say as
                                little as possible. It would seem that this whole matter should be
                                worked out completely with Ceylon before any announcement is made,
                                even perhaps to the wording of the announcement. For if an
                                announcement is made before this is done, we will be committed to
                                give some aid, and if we cannot work out the “cooperation” plan, we
                                will have to give the aid under Section 401 with its resulting
                                disadvantages.</p>
                            <p>What has been said above with respect to an aid program is equally
                                applicable to a reactor contract with the further complication that
                                if the reactor program is not to be part of <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                                    >MSA</gloss> appropriations, Section 401 is not available and
                                either “b” or “c” above would have to be followed in order to be
                                able legally to follow up with a bilateral reactor contract.<note

                                telegram 385, January 11, the Department informed the Embassy that
                                the determination had been made to grant Ceylon U.S. economic
                                assistance in fiscal year 1956. The Embassy was instructed that no
                                information regarding this decision was to be given to the Ceylonese
                                until authorized by the Department. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>
                                746E.5–MSP/ 1–1156) In telegram 413, January 19, the Department
                                asked <persName corresp="#p_CPK1">Crowe</persName> to explore with

                                the modalities whereby Ceylon could regulate its trade with China so
                                as to qualify for aid under the Battle Act. (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >Ibid.,</hi> 746E.5–MSP/1–1956)</note> Prime Minister told me
                            today he is willing restrict rubber shipments Red China to 50,000 tons
                            per year. Present shipment running about 2,000 tons per year above this.
                            He is also willing embargo other strategic commodities. He added that he
                            has always been personally opposed to China deal but that politically it
                            would be worth his scalp to try jettison it now. It should not be
                            forgotten that the China Pact has been worth an average of ten million
                            dollars per year to Ceylon.</p>
                        <p>It is my opinion that there would be a good chance of Ceylon refusing to
                            renew the Pact when it comes up in 1957 if we bring a worthwhile aid
                            program and the government is reasonably sure we intend continue it for
                            immediate future. There is even a chance of terminating the Pact before
                            1957 if the world price rubber stays up, the Prime Minister wins his
                            forthcoming election in April and we give Ceylon economic aid now.</p>
                        <p>As I have repeatedly pointed out during my recent consultations in
                            Department now is the time help the Prime Minister and the government in
                            power. The opposition are putting him under continual pressure on
                            account of his pro-Western bias and continually ask him to show tangible
                            proofs resulting from his friendship with America. In April he faces his
                            first and certainly most crucial election and I strongly believe that
                            our help today would be deeply appreciated. Failure to help now would
                            have just as strong reverse effects.</p>
                        <p>The milk gift, while appreciated, is not considered aid. Ceylon, unlike
                            India, Pakistan and Egypt, will have to pay for the shipping.
                            Furthermore, everyone is well aware that we are endeavoring to get rid
                            excess commodities.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he was
                            delighted to be the first U.S. Secretary of State to visit Ceylon and
                            that he had a personal association with the island which made his visit
                            particularly pleasant to him. He mentioned a ceremony which had just
                            taken place at the American Embassy, where the members of the staff had
                            presented him with a memorial volume describing the work in Ceylon of
                            his great great grandmother and her husband, the Reverend Miron
                            Winslow.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he was glad
                            that the question of economic aid to Ceylon had been worked out. A good
                            deal of delay had resulted from what he might call “rubber tape”. He
                            said that following a very effective presentation of the case to him by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CPK1">Crowe</persName> last November,
                            he had become entirely convinced that it was ridiculous for the United
                            States to be giving aid to India, which followed a “neutralist” policy
                            which gave much comfort to the communists, whereas Ceylon, which was
                            strongly anti-communist, was refused aid. He had dictated a two-line
                            memorandum stating his policy decision that aid to Ceylon should be
                            granted, and directing those in charge to find the appropriate means to
                            do so.<note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3">Reference is apparently to <ref

                            difficulties had been raised, because of Ceylon’s sale of rubber to
                            Communist China, but he had insisted that the aid arrangement be worked
                            out and he was glad it had been accomplished.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KSJL1">Sir John</persName> expressed his deep
                            appreciation for the Secretary’s action and for Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_CPK1">Crowe</persName>’s effective presentation. (As
                            regards India, he commented in passing that the more India abused the
                                <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0289"/>United States Government,
                            the more aid we gave India. The Secretary said this was not quite
                            correct.) <persName corresp="#p_KSJL1">Sir John</persName> went on to
                            ask how the money could be spent before June 30, which he understood to
                            be our requirement.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CPK1">Crowe</persName> pointed out that
                            the money did not actually have to be spent but it did have to be
                            allocated to specific projects. The Secretary said that it should be
                            done soon because Congress was always annoyed by allocations made during
                            the last few days before the close of our fiscal year. He emphasized
                            that the projects should be for activities other than agricultural
                            development, in view of the surplus agricultural problem in the United
                            States.</p>

                        <p>My visit to Ceylon is a very happy one with an atmosphere of great
                            cordiality prevailing and evidence of strong sympathy for our
                            international policies. I have conferred first with the Prime Minister,
                            whom you may recall was in Washington, and then with Governor
                                General,<note n="2" xml:id="d138fn2">A memorandum of <persName

                            begs US to stand firm and says that any weakening of our position in the

                            particularly urges continuing support to Chiang Kai-Shek. Here they have
                            much the same fear of India as India professes for Pakistan.</p>

                        <p>After an exchange of amenities there was a discussion of the world
                            situation, with the President leading off in a description of the
                            efforts he is making to bring about a settlement on the basis of peace
                            and justice in the Middle East. The President developed the theme of our
                            approach through the United Nations, emphasizing that our country does
                            not seek domination of other countries but believes that there should be
                            the same rule of justice relating to small countries as well as big
                            ones. He described briefly his aversion to warfare and stated that the
                            United States is pursuing every avenue it can to avoid and eliminate
                            military conflict. He said that he has seen too much of the destructive
                            effects of warfare not to have an aversion for it. The President said in
                            respect to the Middle East affair, it was regrettable that there should
                            be charges of imperialism and a return to colonialism levelled against
                            the British and the French. He felt that the problem was not that simple
                            and he also stated the conviction that both the British and French have
                            moved a long way from the former ideas in the colonial field. The Prime
                            Minister agreed that there had been opinion in his country and in the
                            world at large that the Anglo-French action in the Middle East marked a
                            reversion to old methods, but he joined in the hope that this was not
                            so. The President added that in any event the Soviet action in Hungary
                            so far overshadowed in its brutality and cruelty the Middle East matter
                            that there could be no comparison. The Prime Minister did not seem to
                            give wholehearted assent to that view. The President described the
                            onerous character of the military burden, mentioning that in our efforts
                            to arrive at a peaceful solution of the Middle East crisis that we
                            should not forget the <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0292"/>Soviet
                            menace. He referred to the large-scale Soviet sale of arms to Egypt and
                            the profuse offers made by the Soviet Union of arms to Egypt and other
                            countries at little expense. He pointed out that it is one thing to
                            receive expensive armaments in a country and yet another to provide the
                            budget and economic effort to support such armament. He said that the
                            United States is very careful not to induce other countries to accept
                            expensive armament when we know that they cannot afford to maintain it.
                            No such reservation seems to prevail in connection with the Soviet
                            Union, which uses its military and economic aid offers to penetrate the
                            recipient country and then gradually by process of economic and other
                            pressures to take over the control of the country. Thus there is a
                            serious distinction between the objective of the United States in this
                            regard and that of the Soviet Union. He pointed to the fact that
                            unfortunately because of the Soviet policies this country is obliged to
                            spend 10% of its gross national product and 50% of its national budget
                            on military defense. We would like to be relieved of that burden which
                            we do not enjoy. The Prime Minister said he realized this and
                            appreciated the President’s attitude which he found heartening and about
                            which he congratulated the President. The President added that had it
                            not been for all these pressing world problems he never would have been
                            willing to stand for reelection. He felt that in light of present world
                            conditions it was essential that his Cabinet and himself, the same group
                            acquainted with these problems, stay in place during these critical
                            days.</p>
                        <p>There was a discussion of the Arab-Israeli relations. The President
                            informed the Prime Minister that whatever may have been the mistakes in
                            the past, Israel is a permanent fact of life. Our task is to do whatever
                            we can to build a more constructive Arab-Israeli relationship and to
                            avoid provoking controversy over that issue; that could lead to a major
                            war which would be terrible. The Prime Minister agreed.</p>
                        <p>After further friendly exchanges, the Prime Minister presented a gift to
                            the President which included a collection of the precious stones of
                            Ceylon. The President in turn presented to the Prime Minister an
                            autographed photograph. After cordial exchange of greetings and mutual
                            regard with expressions of desire of close cooperation between the two
                            countries, the interview was terminated.<note n="2" xml:id="d140fn2"

                            mouthing Marxian phraseology has repeatedly called for cooperation of

                            outside government. Prime Minister’s changed attitude results variety
                            factors including: (1) defeat of MEP in most municipal and urban
                            elections last December by “independents” many of whom were regarded as
                                <gloss target="#t_UNP1">UNP</gloss> supporters in disguise; (2)
                            victory of <gloss target="#t_UNP1">UNP</gloss> in Kandy and Colombo
                            elections. Prime Minister actively participated in Colombo campaign

                            of some kind of coup; (5) Prime Minister’s own deep-rooted feelings of
                            insecurity and intense personal desire remain as Prime Minister for his
                            elected term … ; (6) effect of anti-Western influences including
                            Communists and Sinhalese extremists in poisoning his mind.</p>
                        <p>If Prime Minister remains physically and mentally well odds are he will

                            by communal disturbances leading to uncontrollable riots. Prime Minister
                            believes he can maintain control by playing opposing individuals and
                            groups in government against each other, but he may get beyond his

                                >NSC</gloss> Planning Board to propose a change in paragraph 80 of

                        <p>He pointed out that the Planning Board was unanimous in its support of
                            this revision, but that the Joint Chiefs of Staff were opposed to the
                            revision on the ground that no such change should be made until
                            completion of the forthcoming review of U.S. economic defense policy by
                            the National Security Council. (A copy of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Cutler</persName>’s briefing note is filed in the minutes of the
                            meeting.) He then asked Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> for further comments.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that it
                            didn’t seem to him to make very much difference whether paragraph 80 was
                            revised or not. In point of fact, this Government was already following
                            the course of action set forth in the proposed revision of paragraph 80
                            prepared by the Planning Board. The Joint Chiefs of Staff simply felt it
                            desirable to point out the forthcoming review of U.S. economic defense
                            policy and its bearing on the revision of paragraph 80.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired whether Ceylon was now finding itself in greater
                            need of rice than had been the case when Ceylon made its first contract
                            to exchange Ceylonese rubber for rice from Communist China. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> replied that this was
                            probably not the case, but that Ceylon must nevertheless find a market
                            for its rubber.</p>
                        <p>The President then stated that this seemed to be one more instance of the
                            Communist practice of exporting food which was in <pb n="274"
                                xml:id="pg_274" facs="0296"/>short supply at home. Accordingly, it
                            might be a positive advantage to the Free World to encourage Communist
                            China to sell rice, even though this vital commodity was in short
                            supply. This would prove harmful to Chinese Communist government policy
                            in China.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> again repeated
                            that he felt it was of no particular consequence whether paragraph 80
                            were revised or not. The President indicated that he believed the
                            revision should be made, and that the proposed new policy would probably
                            represent no loss to the United States in any case. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> expressed agreement with the
                            President’s view.</p>

                                no doubt but that the Soviet Union and its European satellites and
                                Communist China have recently greatly increased the tempo and scope
                                of their efforts to supplement political penetration of South Asia
                                with economic penetration. This is particularly true with respect to
                                Afghanistan and India. The realization of the seriousness of this
                                economic offensive has been heightened by the free world’s military
                                reverses in Indo-China. Communist efforts in India have been at
                                least partially successful, e.g., the number of delegations between
                                the Soviet-Communist China bloc and India has been greatly stepped
                                up in the last year; the conclusion of an Indo-Communist China trade

                                    agreement did not result in the reconciliation of previously
                                    expressed points of view. The crucial barrier to agreement was
                                    India’s insistence on the pre-determination of flight
                                    frequencies which was a principle the US could accept in the
                                    Indian case only at the risk of endangering its worldwide
                                    position against pre-determination. The Government of India has
                                    issued temporary permits authorizing continued operation of two
                                    round-trip flights weekly to and through India, each by Pan
                                    American and Trans-World Airlines. Each company has, in the
                                    past, been operating three round trips weekly. <gloss

                                <p>At the same time that India is making it more difficult for US
                                    airlines to operate in India, a question has arisen here
                                    directly affecting India’s own air operations. India has ordered
                                    three Super Constellation aircraft in the United States. The
                                    aircraft became or will become ready for delivery, one in
                                    January, one in February and one in March of 1955. They require
                                    US export licenses. India’s announced intention of
                                    instituting—at some vague future date—air service between India
                                    and Canton via Hong Kong raised the question of the conditions
                                    under which the US should license the export of these planes, in
                                    view of the possibility that some US equipment—if it were used
                                    on the Hong Kong-Canton run—might fall into the hands of the
                                    Communist Chinese. After lengthy discussions in the Department,

                                    issue instructions for an export license on the plane ready for
                                    delivery on January 3. The fate of the other two planes has not
                                    been decided.</p></item>

                        <p>If this is true, I do hope that you will urge our new Ambassador there to

                            successful in the past, and we, on our part, should avoid putting chores
                            on our Ambassador that would almost compel him to show an unsympathetic

                                >Pillai</persName> was that <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> believed that if these charges are true that U.S.
                            is purposely trying to undermine him in India before Indian people.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PSNR1">Pillai</persName> interjected at time
                            surely U.S. would not do this. What would happen if <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> were not the head of the
                            government? Continuing on the subject, <persName corresp="#p_PSNR1"
                                >Pillai</persName> said suspicions of officials about U.S. attitude
                            were strengthened by unfavorable press reports regarding India received
                            almost <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0302"/>daily from U.S. He said
                            that he did not attach as much importance to these as some members of
                            the Cabinet because he knew there were many favorable articles.
                            Mentioning <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>,
                            he laughed and said that Prime Minister was not much concerned about
                            their articles. After he had finished, I said to him that I had no
                            knowledge of the general suspicion until my first press conference when
                            several members of the Indian press had asked me about subsidization of
                            Indian newspapers by the U.S., and I had responded by saying I would not
                            accept any assumption that subsidization has occurred. I then said to
                                <persName corresp="#p_PSNR1">Pillai</persName> that I could
                            categorically deny all of the above reports and could also state that
                            the U.S. did not subsidize any Indian publication or individual. He was
                            polite about this and said that he would accept fully my statement.</p>
                        <p>He then countered by saying that from Indian experience with the British
                            before independence he knew as did Government of India that British
                            maintained secret organizations about which other British officials had
                            no knowledge, and Government of India knew British still maintained such
                            agencies. I took this as implying that Government of India believed U.S.
                            had organizations about whose activities preceding Ambassadors and I
                            would not know. Said Government of India took a serious view matter, and
                            would be difficult for frank consultation on U.S.-Indian problems and
                            advancement our relations if this suspicion continued. He said Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> would want talk
                            with me after I had communicated with U.S. Government. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PSNR1">Pillai</persName>’s attitude friendly, saying it
                            difficult talk about this subject but necessary suspicions be cleared
                            up. Although <persName corresp="#p_PSNR1">Pillai</persName> very fair I
                            felt he too had some belief report U.S. activities. In concluding his
                            recital of rumors <persName corresp="#p_PSNR1">Pillai</persName> told me
                            these had been base of his suggestion to me soon after my arrival that

                        <p>To clear up this situation I am sure that Government of India will expect

                        <p>As stated <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1829, my answer must
                            be quite clear to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. I believe I can

                        <p>Further, I can point out that, far from undermining <gloss

                            efforts.</p>
                        <p>If necessary convince <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> I am being
                            fully frank, I intend point out <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>
                            assistance to publishers in encouraging publication of American books
                            under book translation program. I can explain it my understanding <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has long been aware this activity which
                            at all times has been conducted in aboveboard manner.</p>
                        <p>There only one situation of which I have received knowledge which might
                            be misunderstood by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. This was
                            purchase by <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> from magazine <hi
                                rend="italic">Thought</hi> of 5,000 pamphlets written by Indian
                            trade union leader Shastri entitled “My China Diary”,<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d146fn4">“From My China Diary” was written by Brajkishore
                                Shastri.</note> which were distributed by <hi rend="italic"
                                >Thought</hi> on basis of list agreed to by <gloss target="#t_USIS1"
                                >USIS</gloss> and <hi rend="italic">Thought</hi>. This seems to me
                            borderline arrangement which on facts could not be deemed unfavorable to
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, but which as general principle
                            would undoubtedly be considered by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            as type of arrangement to which they might object. I shall not, however,
                            bring this matter up unless they initiate it.</p>
                        <p>Department … has fuller information than I have submitted regarding …
                            activities which I hope will be taken into account in response of
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>Unless Department, <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>, or <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> have information contradictory to
                            above, I propose flatly and firmly to inform <persName
                                corresp="#p_PSNR1">Pillai</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> specific rumors he mentioned are completely and
                            utterly without foundation. I assume that in any statement I make
                            concerning practices of our information services, there has been nothing
                            done by any other agency which would contradict my proposed statement,
                            but I must be informed fully about this. If I should make firm <pb
                                n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0305"/>representations which are not
                            true in fact, it would impair my usefulness here.</p>
                        <p>However, I believe there is a more important issue involved, not fully
                            disclosed by <persName corresp="#p_PSNR1">Pillai</persName> but which
                            may motivate the thinking of <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> and his
                            Cabinet. It has been clear to me since coming here that deepest
                            disagreements between United States and <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> lie in our foreign policy and the assumptions upon
                            which our policy is based. When reasons for our policy are explained by
                            American Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, in accord
                            with State and <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> guidances and
                            instructions, then they contradict many assumptions upon which <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> foreign policy is based. I suspect that
                            what may be really troubling <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is the
                            thought that American officials in India are trying to convince Indians
                            of correctness of American foreign policy and desirability of its
                            support, which by implication suggests rejection of <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s foreign policy. If this basic
                            reason, then ultimate effort of <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> may be to reduce to greatest possible degree or
                            stop <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> in efforts to fairly present
                            United States policy. This, to me, is position which we could not accept
                            and which we must oppose. Such a <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            position would contradict our conception of free information and would
                            represent adoption by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> of their own
                            kind of iron curtain. In this context, therefore, it seems natural that
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> as public voice and
                            interpreter of United States Government should be target. Feel certain
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> aware that <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, with extensive operating mechanism
                            and trained personnel stationed at key points, delivers continuing
                            impact throughout India.</p>
                        <p>Another illuminating factor is recent experience of <hi rend="italic">New
                                York Times</hi> business representative Bailey<note n="5"

                            Bailey reported after three months unavailing efforts he found much
                            active anti-American attitude in high government circles. In my view
                            this <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> experience indicates
                            unwillingness of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to have full
                            coverage of United States policy developments plus sober American
                            editorial reactions made available to its citizens.</p>
                        <p>It possible that basic question of freedom of United States to state and
                            interpret persuasively within India United States foreign policy may
                            have to be discussed with <persName corresp="#p_PSNR1">Pillai</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>. If I am to be in

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> responded by saying that he
                            accepted without question my statement and that of Department and said
                            that he did not question in any way the friendship, good purposes, and
                            desire for good relations of United States. He then said that he felt
                            that he <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0309"/>must say he did not
                            think suspicions or charges on past operations entirely baseless,
                            suggesting as <persName corresp="#p_PSNR1">Pillai</persName>, there
                            might be some organization “in the vast United States Government” which
                            charged with certain policies might, “mistakenly” undertake such
                            operations, or some individual or perhaps some persons outside scope of
                            government might “mistakenly” undertake same. Only specific suggestion
                            he made was that organizations could in an apparently legal and normal
                            way assist publications by favorable contracts for their work. I gave
                            him such details were available to me on <gloss target="#t_USIS1"
                                >USIS</gloss> contracts for printing, saying that they were normal
                            and prices normal, and <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> is willing
                            to discuss same with representative of <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> if he desired. He further said that he had impression
                            that <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> was not under authority [of
                            Ambassador. I replied?] that I did have responsibility inquiring into
                            its operations and seeing to it that they were in accord with United
                            States policy which was to support and maintain friendliest cooperative
                            and honorable relations with India, and that I would do so. At end I
                            said that I would say as a representative United States Government that
                            Department or <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> had not engaged and
                            would not engage in such activities. We then discussed briefly general
                            problem of interchange of views by information services and necessity
                            for freedom of information, and while he did not dwell long on subject,
                            he said that such interchanges were acceptable and necessary. My

                                        “No one ever anticipated or expected that <gloss

                                        engage in any concentrated looking, asking, or digging. We
                                        have always held that most of the information in which the
                                        Agency is particularly interested, and which is not received
                                        from other agencies, is the type of information which <gloss

                                        “Propaganda activities of other countries and groups;
                                        indigenous media facilities, target groups, etc.” Cloak and
                                        dagger operations, he wrote, did not come under that
                                        heading. Loomis did want book and periodical collection,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear General Edgerton</hi>: J.R.D. Tata and other
                            representatives of the Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) have come to
                            the United States to seek financial assistance in expanding the capacity
                            of their steel works by about 700,000 ingot tons.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d149fn2">In late 1954, the Soviet Union had offered to
                                construct a steel mill for India under easy credit terms. B.M.
                                Birla, an Indian industrialist, then approached the United States
                                and the United Kingdom seeking support for a privately-financed
                                steel plant to counter the Soviet offer. He engaged in preliminary
                                discussions with the Export-Import Bank. On May 25, 1955, a fellow
                                industrialist, J.R.D. Tata, and some of his associates, held
                                separate meetings with <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">George V.
                                    Allen</persName> and Acting Assistant Secretary of State for

                                    Kalijarvi</persName>. Tata told the latter that private funding
                                was not available, and that since he ruled out <gloss
                                    target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> financing because of the
                                requirement for an Indian Government loan guarantee, the
                                Export-Import Bank was his major hope. <persName corresp="#p_KTV1"
                                    >Kalijarvi</persName> encouraged Tata to submit a formal
                                application for assistance. Tata indicated to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> that he hoped to raise $62.5
                                million in the United States, which he maintained would make it
                                possible for him to show what private enterprise could accomplish in
                                India while simultaneously allowing the United States to counter
                                recent Soviet ventures. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>
                                replied that the proposal had to stand on its own merits and not
                                appear to stem from the Soviet initiative, though he hoped private
                                enterprise “would show the Soviet plant to a disadvantage”.

                            people, as you know, have been urging that the President invite
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> to visit the United
                            States. We decided against it two months ago because <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> was on his way to Moscow and we
                            did not want to appear to be climbing on the bandwagon or building up
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> too much. The Moscow
                            visit has now been superseded in the public view by the much more
                            important Summit Conference, and an invitation to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> would not have as many drawbacks
                            now as it had previously.</p>
                        <p>I am inclined to think <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>
                            realizes that he has been too far on the Moscow–Peking side and is
                            looking for a way to climb back a bit. Whether we like it or not,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> will probably run India
                            for some time to come, and India’s good will is worth some effort.</p>
                        <p>I still feel hesitant about wooing <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> too assiduously, particularly since there are no
                            great problems between India and the United States to discuss. Hence, it
                            seems to me that if the chief cause for <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291"
                                facs="0313"/>the visit were to address the English-Speaking Union,
                            with an invitation by President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> for <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> to spend three days in Washington as the guest of
                            the United States Government, the balance would be about right.</p>
                        <p>A visit by <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> in November would
                            be a good occasion for bringing Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJS1"

                            following matter, which leads me believe decision is not based

                                    could be discussed and corrected and information centers should

                        <p>The existing beryl supply arrangement between this Government and the
                            Indian Government provides for automatic renewal for five years unless
                            notice of termination is given by September 30, 1955, which is one year
                            before the expiration of the arrangement’s current term. Beryl is
                            classified as a strategic material.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi></p>
                        <p>The original deadline for a decision as to renewal was September 30,
                            1954. In effect, a year’s grace period was obtained, by agreement with
                            the Government of India. This grace period was suggested by the U.S.
                            because of uncertainties as to continuing U.S. needs and sources of
                            funds and in recognition of the favorable provisions of the existing
                            arrangement.</p>
                        <p>The present positions of the various interested agencies are understood
                            to be as follows:</p>
                        <p>The Atomic Energy Commission, the Department of Defense, and the Office
                            of Defense Mobilization consider that renewal or <pb n="294"
                                xml:id="pg_294" facs="0316"/>extension of the arrangement is not
                            warranted on the basis of present and foreseeable demand for beryl to
                            meet defense and related U.S. Government requirements. Accordingly, they
                            are not prepared to underwrite the continuance of the U.S. beryl
                            arrangement with India. It is understood that the prime potential
                            requirement, if any, would be operational, which therefore leaves the
                            major determination of further requirements to the Department of
                            Defense.</p>
                        <p>The administrator of the Battle Act considers it desirable that beryl
                            supplies be denied to the Soviet Bloc (the present arrangement tends to
                            encourage the retention of the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>’s
                            official restrictions on general exports of beryl), and is prepared to
                            support a request to fund a continuance of the arrangement from special
                            funds of the President.</p>
                        <p>In the course of previous <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> meetings,
                            it has been suggested that beryl might be downgraded on the strategic
                            list; it is understood at this time that such downgrading is highly
                            unlikely. The <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> has also considered in
                            the past the possibility of negotiating an agreement providing for
                            automatic annual renewal. The Department of State believes that it would
                            be extremely difficult to obtain such an agreement on similarly
                            favorable terms.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State considers that renewal of this arrangement for a
                            full five-year term is in the interest of the United States, and that
                            failure to do so would tend to be prejudicial to U.S. foreign policy
                            objectives in Asia. The arrangement involves a secret Indian commitment
                            to the U.S. Government. Such cooperation in itself is of some political
                            importance, given India’s posture in world affairs. The commitment is to
                            supply an atomic energy material at world prices; this and other
                            features of the arrangement have contributed to U.S. Indian cooperation
                            in the atomic energy field and to the maintenance of U.S. influence in
                            Indian atomic energy developments. Furthermore, Embassy New Delhi has
                            urged that there be taken into account the political impact of a U.S.
                            withdrawal from the arrangement at a time when the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is increasing its economic influence
                            in India and other countries of the area.<note n="2" xml:id="d152fn2">In
                                telegram 558 from New Delhi, September 20, the Embassy urged that

                                    >Ibid.,</hi> Central Files, 891.2546/9–2055)</note> Finally, the
                            renewal or non-renewal of the arrangement has Battle Act implications,
                            and non-renewal would appear to be inconsistent with U.S. policy guiding
                            the extremely difficult negotiations, now at long last virtually
                            completed, covering U.S. purchase of India’s exportable supplies of
                            thorium compounds. The possibility of strategic exports by India to
                            Communist countries, as in the case of thorium, could be substantially
                            increased if the present arrangement is allowed to expire; such a
                            development could gravely jeopardize U.S. relations with India.</p>
                        <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0317"/>
                        <p>Although the Department of State does not presume to appraise the
                            technical requirements of beryl, it must point out that if the U.S.
                            future requirements dictate the desirability of a new arrangement for
                            beryl, it will be extremely difficult if not impossible to obtain a new
                            arrangement with India on similarly favorable terms.</p>
                        <p>The cost of renewing the contract should be manageable and is likely to
                            continue to be modest in terms of the interest at stake. Deliveries have
                            averaged about $150,000 a year. (They constituted about one-third of all
                            beryl procurement by the Government in Fiscal Year 1955 and are
                            estimated to be one-half of such procurement in Fiscal Year 1956.) The
                            annual cost under the Agreement, can theoretically, run to about $1.3
                            million, but present information indicates that this contingency which
                            involves substitution of beryllium hydroxide for beryl ore will continue
                            to be hypothetical for several years.</p>
                        <p>Potentially, renewal of the contract might be funded by one of several
                            means. The Office of Defense Mobilization could authorize the General
                            Services Administration to procure beryl under the Defense Production
                                Act<note n="3" xml:id="d152fn3">For text of the Defense Production

                                1955, see 69 Stat. 580.</note> for commercial distribution.
                            Secondly, it might be possible under Section 401 of the Mutual Security
                            Act of 1955<note n="4" xml:id="d152fn4">See P.L. 138, approved July 8,
                                1955 (69 Stat. 283). Section 401 created a Special Fund which the
                                President could use to further the purposes of the Act without

                                was important to U.S. security. Some of the sums were changed in

                            assistance for India in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957. India
                            has adopted an ambitious Second Five Year Plan, which will result in a
                            large financial gap and increased need for foreign assistance. Success
                            of the Plan is of major importance politically to the Government. At the
                            moment, the financial problems inherent in the Plan are resulting in
                            conflict between moderate leaders in India who wish to pursue a
                            conservative financial and political policy and radical elements who
                            demand increased State control of the economy to assure success. A
                            reduction in U.S. aid at this time would play into the hands of these
                            radical elements and could set Indian economic policy on a more
                            dangerously Socialistic path for the future. Further, a substantial
                            Soviet economic penetration of India is now developing.<note n="4"

                                >Nehru</persName> but on a cold assessment of U.S. interests. In the
                            circumstances, he felt continuation of U.S. aid to India was definitely
                            in U.S. interests.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> stated that although

                            could buy support. In view of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName>’s consistent support of the Communist position and

                            U.S. aid would only build up an unfriendly government. He suggested that
                            we might get more results in India if we withhold aid and forced them to
                            consider their position without it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRC1">Hill</persName> referred to the current
                            visit of Soviet leaders to India and suggested that decision be deferred

                            have gone out of their way to ask Embassy officers not to read undue
                            significance into hospitality extended to Russian visitors. Indians

                            India’s importance in their global strategy is such that they will make
                            prodigious effort make good on promises. Even though they offer help
                            relatively modest gift at this time they will probably score impressive
                            propaganda gain because they are presenting themselves to India as
                            dynamic, cheerful, friendly, robustly self-confident, while Indians—on
                            basis press reports, right or wrongly—are beginning to wonder whether

                            the Russians will undoubtedly be only too glad to fill these. This will

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi></p>
                        <p>The atmosphere of U.S.-Indian relations improved during the period under
                            review. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s criticisms of
                            U.S. collective security policies were less emotional than in other
                            recent periods, and the Indian press moderated itself accordingly. Main
                            reasons for this trend were probably the easing of cold war tensions and
                            a wider recognition within India of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s earnest desire for world
                            peace. On the whole, purely bilateral U.S.-Indian relations also
                            improved during the period, owing to efforts on both sides to emphasize
                            the common ground in our objectives. These trends did not however
                            indicate any marked rapprochement on the major points at
                            issue—international Communism and colonialism—and were accompanied by
                            trends towards closer relations between India and the Soviet Union in
                            many fields. Whether United States objectives with respect to India
                            moved any closer to being fulfilled remained an open, but perhaps more
                            realistic, question.</p>
                        <p>Within India, the States Reorganization Commission report was an
                            important development. The Congress Party apparently strengthened
                            itself, particularly in relation to the non-Communist left. The
                            Communist party may also have gained, on the whole, from the Soviet
                            Union’s expressions of admiration for the Government of India. The
                            Indian economy continued to expand steadily and Indian officials weighed
                            ambitious new targets for India’s future economic progress. These
                            developments did not radically alter the context of <pb n="302"
                                xml:id="pg_302" facs="0324"/>United States objectives with regard to
                            India, but they did underline the strength and appeal of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> government and our continued need
                            to support it as the only strong, stable and responsible government in
                            sight in India today.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">International Relations:</hi></p>
                        <p>A more favorable Indian attitude towards the United States was evidenced,
                            during the half year under review, by the absence of any outburst of
                            criticism of American foreign policy by <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> comparable to his caustic attacks of last March 31
                            or of September 30 previously. A similar change in <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>’s behavior was notable,
                            though attributable in part to ulterior motives. Indian press and public
                            opinion seemed to register a similar shift, to a position of less
                            distrust of American policy, and sometimes open praise.</p>
                        <p>It appeared possible that these changes in the Indian attitude were the
                            results of a deliberate decision on <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName>’s part. He may have wished to counterbalance some
                            of the several top-level exchanges of visits and joint declarations with
                            Communist countries over the last year. However, the basic reasons for
                            the change probably were the thawing of the cold war and a greater
                            appreciation of United States efforts for world peace.</p>
                        <p>The general easing of cold war tensions, which began near the close of
                            the last period under review, culminated in the Geneva “Summit Meeting”
                            in July. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>, and the Indian
                            press and public generally, gave the major credit to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> for the “success” of the
                            conference and the emerging “spirit of Geneva”. This was a notable shift
                            of Indian attitude toward United States policy in the cold war, but it
                            remained to a large extent an accolade to the President personally.
                            Subsequently, when the President suffered his heart attack,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d155fn2">September 23, 1955.</note> the spontaneous and

                        <p>Prospective U.S.-Indian economic ties showed some tendency to weaken
                            during the period under review. The Administration requested $19.5
                            million for technical assistance to India, Congress appropriated $15
                            million and that total was cut by Executive action to $10 million (a
                            one-third decrease from last year’s total). The Administration requested
                            $70 million for developmental aid to India, the House cut it to $60
                            million, the Senate to $50 million and the Executive Branch tentatively
                            to $40 million (well below the level of aid for fiscal years 1954 and
                            1955). These reductions were not criticized by the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> but undoubtedly caused disappointment,
                            particularly because of India’s accelerating development program and the
                            widened gap envisioned in India’s Second Five Year Plan. Moreover, the
                            Budget Bureau took the tentative position that it was the intent of
                            Congress to substitute PL 480 (agricultural surplus) assistance for
                            regular development aid during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956.
                            This action suggested the possibility that India might receive no
                            development assistance from the United States this fiscal year at all.
                            It was certain that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> itself could
                            hardly acknowledge a PL 480 arrangement as an adequate substitute for
                            developmental aid, and would consider the elimination of regular
                            developmental aid as a major reversal of United States attitude towards
                            India.</p>
                        <p>Ironically, while these developments tended to cast doubt upon the future
                            of our established economic aid programs, there were many indications of
                            greater Indian acceptance of the value of economic cooperation with the
                            United States. High Indian officials expressed more than usual
                            appreciation of American economic aid (notably at the Colombo Plan
                            Council meeting at Singapore), took the initiative in securing the
                            cooperation of Colombo Plan countries for the U.S. Fund for Asian
                            Economic Development, asked for a large number of additional American
                            technicians to work in India, and suggested joint U.S.-Indian economic
                            assistance to Nepal to minimize Communist China’s potential economic and
                            political influence in that country. Other favorable developments were
                            Tata’s increasingly favorable attitude toward U.S. equipment for its
                            steel-mill expansion plan; the arrival of two top American economists to
                            work with the Planning Commission on the Second Five Year Plan; a

                            was also proffered in the fields of atomic energy, non-ferrous metals
                            industries, coal mining and oil exploration. Some similar offers were
                            reportedly forthcoming from Czechoslovakia, Rumania, Poland and East
                            Germany. In addition, India and the U.S.S.R. agreed to a civil airline
                            connection at Prague, and reportedly negotiated for a more direct
                            through route via Tashkent. These moves were in harmony with the Indian
                            concept of “peaceful coexistence” and cooperation, but of course did not
                            portend a departure from the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>’s basic

                        <p>We discussed the evolution in Russia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> felt that on the basis of his observations there
                            was a very great change going on. There was more tolerance, greater
                            education and the people were <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0329"
                            />becoming technically minded. He said a copy of his book had been
                            translated and was now widely circulated in Russia. This illustrated the
                            increasing opening up of Russia to new ideas. He believed that their
                            desire to increase their domain had diminished and indeed had expired.
                            The development was like that in France where the violent and bloody
                            revolution gradually subsided into nationalism and acceptance of normal
                            relations. He thought that the Chinese, although inherently less
                            aggressive than the Russians, were as yet more aggressive because of
                            their greater nearness to their revolution.</p>
                        <p>He thought we were making a great mistake in not recognizing Communist
                            China. It was a fact and it was better to recognize it voluntarily when
                            we had a choice than to do so later on more or less under compulsion. He
                            spoke of Taiwan and felt that a solution of Taiwan might very well be
                            deferred for a good many years, but he said the offshore-island business
                            was another matter. We could not stand getting shot at every day from
                            across straits of only a few miles in width.</p>
                        <p>He discussed his attitude toward collective security arrangements. He
                            said he recognized that NATO might have been born of a real necessity.
                            He doubted the genuine security value of any of the Asian arrangements.
                            He bitterly deplored <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and
                            Baghdad, which he felt Pakistan had entered not for security against the
                            Soviet Communists but in order to get strength to use against India. He
                            felt that the Pakistanis were a martial people and a fanatical people
                            who could readily attack India. The present government might not have
                            that intention, but the situation was unstable and governments could
                            readily change. He deplored the fact that United States armament of
                            Pakistan was leading India to arm and to make large expenditures for
                            defense when it wanted to concentrate its efforts on improving its
                            economic and social condition. (In this discussion of Pakistan with
                            which he dealt at length, he showed signs of strong emotion.)</p>
                        <p>We discussed the situation in the Near East. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> bitterly condemned the British
                            policy which he said was doomed to failure.</p>
                        <p>He felt that there was a failure on the part of the Western leaders
                            really to appreciate the evolution that was going on in Asia. We were
                            still dealing with potentates who represented the old regime, and that
                            was doomed. It was necessary to get en rapport with the new spirit.
                            Pakistan, Iraq and so forth were still feudal communities. He defended
                            Egypt taking arms from the Soviet Union on the ground that it could not
                            get them elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>In answer to my description of our policy toward colonialism, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> said that he recognized
                            that our ties with Britain, France and so forth were such that we could
                            not openly break with them. However, he, <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName>, had to identify himself with the new movement <pb
                                n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0330"/>of the peoples of Asia. He felt
                            the same way toward Africa, but was not as active there because that was
                            really beyond the area of his responsibility.</p>
                        <p>(The conversation was intimate and animated and informal. We sat and
                            walked at various places in the room and at the end <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> was sitting on the back of the
                            sofa.)</p>
                        <p>The conversation was resumed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> attacking Pakistan with great emotion as being a
                            military state run by the Army. He described the border incidents around
                            Kashmir. He renewed his attack on <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> as essentially involving an alliance with Pakistan
                            against India. I said, “Why don’t you join <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss>?” He looked somewhat startled and said I could hardly
                            expect him to join an organization of which he morally disapproved and
                            which he thought mischievous. I said he might be able to change its
                            character if he were a member.</p>
                        <p>He spoke of the necessity of India raising its level of forces much as he
                            had done the day before.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the talk about <gloss target="#t_GOA1">Goa</gloss>
                            where he repeated the well-known Indian line, he said that he felt that
                            he might have to publicize our diplomatic correspondence,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d156fn2">Documentation is <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi>
                                753D.00.</note> and asked my permission. I said obviously I could
                            not refuse permission, but I did not think it would help our relations
                            to have this correspondence published. I might ask Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJS1">Cooper</persName> to speak to him further about
                            this phase of the matter.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I arrived at Ceylon this morning and it cheered me to receive your

                            difficult in the course of these trips to give much continuous thinking

                            dismiss from my mind the critical situation in the Near East and I am

                            matters require careful staffing which I cannot supply here.</p>
                        <p>I had a most interesting, and I think rather significant two-day meeting
                            in India. Most of the time I spent with <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName>. He had completely cleared his calendar for the
                            two days of my visit. The first day we had three and one-half hours
                            together just the two of us, in a most intimate way. I was amused that
                            toward the end of the conference he was sitting on the back of the sofa
                            with his feet on the seat. We really took our hair down. Then we met
                            again for nearly two hours yesterday, and I had several intermediate
                            talks with him at various social functions.<note n="4" xml:id="d157fn4"
                                >See <ref target="#d156">Document 156</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>The one distinct impression that I gained is their almost pathological
                            fear of Pakistan. I, of course, knew they did not like our alliance
                            with, and armament program for, Pakistan, but I never appreciated before
                            the full depth of their feeling. I had assumed that India with its far
                            greater population and economic strength would feel relatively immune
                            from any serious threat. However, they feel that Pakistan, or at least
                            West Pakistan, is essentially a military state, largely run by the Army,
                            that they are a martial people, that they are fanatically dedicated to
                            Islam and may develop the urge to attack India or at least to try to
                            take Kashmir or parts of it by force. Their fear is I think accentuated
                            by somewhat of a guilty conscience in that they have themselves in
                            effect taken over Kashmir by force and ignore the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> requirement of a plebiscite. There are border incidents
                            and the whole position bears an unhappy resemblance to the
                            Israeli-Egyptian situation.</p>
                        <p>I do not think we can alter our Pakistan relationship which is of great
                            value, but I do think that we must try to handle it in ways which will
                            give maximum assurance to India that our military aid will only be used
                            for purely defensive purposes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> appreciated your invitation
                            to him. He made no positive reply because his schedule is tight for he
                            has elections of his own coming up in the fall and his Parliament will
                            be in session until almost the date of the Commonwealth conference.
                            However, my strong hunch is he will accept.</p>
                        <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0332"/>
                        <p>Our own talk was of such an intimate character that I think he would like
                            to have something of the same character with you running two or three
                            days.</p>
                        <p>One most disturbing fact is that they are thinking of buying some
                            military planes, I think IL–28 types, from the Russians. I had already
                            been told by Selwyn Lloyd<note n="5" xml:id="d157fn5">British Secretary
                                of State for Foreign Affairs.</note> that this was a possibility,
                            and he indicated that if these planes with Russian technicians were
                            coming, then he was dubious whether they should sell the Canberras with
                            special equipment.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> led up to this subject with
                            obvious caution and gave quite a story as to the background trying to
                            make it appear as innocent as possible. I told him as a first reaction
                            that I could only tell him frankly that I felt it would greatly vex our
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>Last night at dinner I told him that ever since he had first mentioned
                            the subject to me, I had been worrying about it, and that I felt I ought
                            to tell him before leaving that I thought the consequences would be very
                            bad indeed. I said to him, “Why do you do this? You can buy planes from
                            the British. You can buy planes from us. I cannot see why you should buy
                            planes from the Russians knowing that it would make it almost impossible
                            for US to carry on its efforts assist you materially in your second five
                            year plan. That will be hard enough anyway, and this arms deal with
                            Russia, I feel, would make it impossible. I know you will not change
                            your attitude because of foreign pressure and I do not mention the
                            subject in that spirit. I do think that you ought to know what are the
                            probable consequences and then you yourself can judge what is the best
                            course for India.”<note n="6" xml:id="d157fn6">In order to conclude the
                                sale of the Canberra bombers, the British were willing to take a
                                financial loss and divert production intended for the Royal Air
                                Force. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>, however, still
                                thought the British price too high and the projected schedule of
                                delivery too slow. Earlier, the British had gained U.S. approval to
                                sell the planes to the Indians with specialized bombing equipment.
                                The Indians, however, sought a still classified 1,000-lb. low-drag
                                bomb, which was intended for supersonic and not subsonic aircraft
                                such as the Canberra. Moreover, it was an external bomb while the
                                Canberras were fitted for conventional internal bombs. The United
                                States was not prepared to sanction its release at this time to the
                                Indians though the British believed it would be the final sweetener.

                        <p>I had a long and somewhat difficult press conference, which I accepted

                            were there, and the questioning was dominated by Communist and strongly
                            anti-American elements of the press who repeatedly tried to trap me with
                            loaded questions. However, I think on the whole the conference justified
                            itself, and the general impression that I got, up to my midnight hour
                                <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0333"/>of departure was, that on
                            balance it had been productive. The very fact of exposing myself in this

                        <p>India is now moving into its Second Five Year Plan with a planned public
                            and private expenditure double that of the First Five Year Plan which is
                            just ending. The Second Five Year Plan will shift emphasis to
                            industrialization.</p>
                        <p>India’s success in the First Five Year Plan and its needs, combined with
                            its willingness to sacrifice under the Second Five Year Plan in order to
                            build the economic base for the maintenance of independence and
                            democracy, dictate at this time a thorough re-evaluation of U.S. aid
                            programs and policy in India. This re-evaluation of U.S. aid policy must
                            take into account the forceful new communist program of economic
                            penetration. The Soviets stress aid and trade and on every political and
                            economic occasion are taking some pains (with improving tact and
                            ability) to pose as the protector of under-developed Asia’s interest
                            against the more-developed, capitalist West.</p>
                        <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0334"/>
                        <p>U.S. interests dictate continuing close correlation of our U.S. foreign
                            economic policy with personalized diplomacy in the strict political
                            sense.</p>
                        <p>Even though India does not agree with the United States on all major
                            aspects of foreign policy (and for that matter on all aspects of
                            internal economic policy) India is a democratic country and is the
                            largest free country in Asia. It has a great natural resource base in
                            coal, iron and strategic minerals. It is in competition with Communist
                            China in the sense of demonstrating the superior capacity of democracy
                            in Asia for economic achievement for the people. The Soviets—thanks in
                            large part to the success of U.S. policy—are now attempting economic
                            penetration ostensibly on the basis of concern for the economic welfare
                            of these under-developed countries. The Soviet move is an attempt to
                            undermine the West in Asia and to place the United States in a position
                            antithetical to that of the under-developed countries of Asia.</p>
                        <p>It is in the immediate and long-range interest of the United States to
                            aid India in sufficient amounts to make India’s own economic efforts
                            cumulatively successful. Such aid will be helpful in the
                            political-economic sense of re-affirming our continuing interest in
                            under-developed India as a democratic country. It will reaffirm also our
                            sympathetic interest in the welfare of the people of Asia in addition to
                            our concern with military defense against communist aggression.</p>

                        <p>India’s Second Five Year Plan calls for investment of 71 billion rupees
                            ($14.9 billion, of which about $10 billion is in the public sector and
                            $4.9 billion is in selected parts of the private sector). This is an
                            ambitious plan to raise national income by 25 percent over a period of 5
                            years.</p>
                        <p>India’s Second Five Year Plan anticipates expenditures of 48 billion
                            rupees in the public sector. One of the primary concerns of India (a
                            politico-economic concern) is that of unemployment and under-employment.
                            Although it will produce some eight million jobs, the Second Five Year
                            Plan is not expected to produce direct employment opportunities equal to
                            the increase in the labor force.</p>
                        <p>The resources pattern also shows some weakness. In brief, of the 48
                            billion rupees planned for the public sector, one-fourth is expected to
                            come from increased Government revenues (seemingly a rather optimistic
                            assumption), one-fourth from borrowings from the public, one-fourth from
                            printing-press money, and one-fourth is unforeseen except through
                            foreign aid. The estimated gap, therefore, is 12 billion rupees or about
                            $2.5 billion. In terms of India’s need <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313"
                                facs="0335"/>under its greatly-increased Plan expenditures,
                            attention must be given to inflationary impacts and the needs of
                            consumers within a democratic system. India, therefore, will have great
                            need for consumer goods such as our surplus agricultural commodities in
                            the context of the total needs under the Plan.</p>
                        <p>There is grave danger of a serious short-fall in resources for the Plan
                            not only in the above-mentioned internal accounts but also from the
                            standpoint of foreign exchange needed for the Plan. The Indian
                            Government estimates that about 1.7 billion dollars in foreign exchange
                            will remain after allowing for all foreign exchange resources at its
                            command, including the drawing-down of its sterling balances. Indian
                            estimates of assistance from the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>,
                            the Colombo Plan (other than the U.S.) and Soviet assistance for the
                            steel plant would reduce the gap to somewhat less than 1.4 billion
                            dollars. It is our considered opinion that with a great effort by India
                            and cooperation from the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and other
                            countries, the net foreign exchange gap could be reduced to
                            approximately 1.1 billion dollars.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the physical execution as well as the foreign exchange
                            requirements of the Plan, India will require imports of 5 million tons
                            of steel. Steel is in short supply throughout the world; steel prices
                            are continuing to rise. Thus India faces a problem of physical
                            acquisition as well as a problem of foreign exchange requirements in
                            excess of its present Plan estimates.</p>

                        <p>In the U.S. interest a program of aiding India in substantial achievement
                            of its Second Five Year Plan must, in the current situation, be handled
                            as an entity with recognition of the need for larger-scale impact
                            projects of popular appeal and the need for planning expenditure over
                            the Plan period.</p>
                        <p>An effective program does not mean that the U.S. should underwrite the
                            entirety of any gap in India’s Plan. A certain amount of gap should be
                            left for stimulation of greater effort by India—both internally and
                            externally. U.S. aid, however, should take into consideration not only
                            the foreign exchange need but also the internal financial requirements
                            of India along with the political-economic factors involved in possible
                            inflation. While the total residual gap in India’s resources is some 2.0
                            billion dollars, the estimated foreign exchange gap, as indicated above,
                            may be in the order of 1.1 billion dollars. For purposes of analysis and
                            consideration of U.S. aid these two figures are individually pertinent,
                            but shortcomings on one part of the Plan may condition ability to
                            develop resources on the other.</p>
                        <p>In this context the U.S. should consider a total program over a period of
                            up to 5 years, for some 500 millions of dollars in Economic Development

                                        Assistance authorized by the Congress is $70 million. $50
                                        million were appropriated (in addition to the $10 million
                                        allocation for technical assistance to India). In a previous
                                        year such U.S. aid has been about $85 million. Annual
                                        Development Assistance of $75 million over a five-year
                                        period would be consistent with the past action of the
                                        Congress. The 25 million dollar increase over the current
                                            <hi rend="italic">appropriations</hi> for development
                                        aid to India can also be justified in terms of the full
                                        dollar repayment in that amount. This 75 million dollars
                                        annually would total 375 million dollars over a five-year
                                        period. In addition to this amount, the U.S. could help
                                        India in its foreign exchange requirements for the Plan, by
                                        granting (upon request) a long-term moratorium on India’s

                            than at crossroads. Externally, India almost certainly faces
                            readjustments of policies in which factors within its economy are

                        <p>Basic fact is that American prestige is higher than it has been for

                            and economic rivalry with Red China. This posture coincides with

                            of India’s democratic forms and the faith of her present leaders,
                            notably <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> himself, that India
                            can achieve a democratic Asian counterpoise to Red China without resort
                            to authoritarian techniques which could progressively shift India into

                        <p>This Indian crisis centers on a potential inflationary spiral and growing
                            shortfall of foreign exchange requirements which, unless somehow

                            progress and defeat second five-year goals regarded by US as minimal to

                            and specifically US, political objectives. We feel overall objective of
                            talks should be to lay foundation for anchoring India more firmly to
                            West and of orienting India external policy in directions which will, in
                            turn, permit American public opinion and Congress to support India by
                            lines of credit substantial enough to assure Indian capacity and
                            confidence in keeping abreast of China by democratic norms.</p>
                        <p>In context of his problems and disappointments with <gloss

                            (Burma, Nepal), we feel <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>
                            will be more amenable to frank, friendly discussion our problems and his
                            than he might have been in past. He is perhaps less sure and hence will
                            be more sensitive. We feel his economic problem may perhaps be uppermost
                            in his mind but that he will likely be too proud to raise it in form of
                            a specific request for US aid to meet India’s desperate need for foreign
                            exchange.</p>

                        <p>Though this is tactical matter which Secretary and President must decide,
                            we believe our overall objective might be easier to attain if President
                            fairly early in talks invited <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> to discuss his planning objectives and problems
                            and to submit suggestions of ways in which US might assist.</p>
                        <p>Finance Minister T.T. Krishnamachari and <gloss target="#t_MEA1"
                                >MEA</gloss> General Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PSNR1"
                                >Pillai</persName> have told Cooper that <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> was cognizant of critical problem of foreign
                            exchange and that they were urging him to disclose this problem to the
                            President. They hope that the President will initiate discussion by
                            questioning <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> on objectives
                            and problems of first and second plans and that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> would then discuss the urgency of
                            India’s foreign exchange requirements. <persName corresp="#p_PSNR1"
                                >Pillai</persName> thought matter might be carried forward from that
                            point, without any US commitment, by President’s suggesting that he
                            would welcome further information on matter and that his advisors could
                            discuss it with <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s advisors.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJS1">Cooper</persName> thinks that whatever
                            may come from this discussion in the way of economic aid, or even if no
                            economic aid eventuates, it is important for President to inquire fairly
                            early in talks into progress India’s development in some detail since
                            this is <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s primary interest
                            and India’s foreign policy is to a large extent conditioned on India’s
                            need and determination to progress economically as rapidly as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>If this approach were taken, we feel <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> would be more tractable on some of larger
                            political issues on which we probably cannot agree now and that talks
                            would be cast in framework of a positive policy toward which both
                            countries could work while narrowing their differences.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, we feel there is another crucial factor which should govern
                            President’s attitude toward <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                            >Nehru</persName>’s sensitivities and biases in areas where he and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> must now obviously
                            agree to disagree—China, Pakistan, military bases and pacts, nuclear
                            tests. (Department will note that <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                En-Lai</persName> have during latter’s visit<note n="4"

                            issues, including Hungary.)</p>
                        <p>This factor is that <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> and
                            present governing team in India is perhaps as able and as
                            Western-oriented, and certainly as committed to democratic norms, as any
                            team India is likely to produce for some years after <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s passing. The team which follows
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> will emerge from the
                            generation which was educated during the non-cooperation movement and
                            which has never experienced the contact and exposure to Western thought
                            and norms which <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s
                            generation did. This team is bound to be more Asia-for-Asian minded,
                            more inclined to employ authoritarian methods to achieve socio-economic
                                <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0344"/>goals and to keep pace with
                            China, unless <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> has first
                            successfully blazed way through democratic norms. This is one reason
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> must attach importance
                            he does to achieving targets of second five-year plan. And this is
                            compelling reason for our accommodating certain of our objections to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s policies and views
                            and more clearly orienting our policy to the strategic purpose of
                            assisting <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> to achieve a
                            democratic counterpoise to China which would exert magnetic attraction
                            throughout Free Asia.</p>
                        <p>Lines of approach: We would anticipate that the general structure of the

                            </list></p>
                        <p>Presentation of US views: It is basic that the President detail our
                            general strategic concept, our estimate of the situation with particular
                            reference to the Soviet-Sino bloc, our reasons for believing this bloc
                            has not abandoned its aggressive intentions, and concept of “competitive
                            coexistence” within framework of military strength which it is necessary
                            to maintain until adequate disarmament safeguards can be implemented. If
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> accepts (as we think he
                            will) fact that our intentions are peaceful, other problems should be
                            more easily handled. We feel President should develop thesis that
                            long-range objectives of India and US are parallel, that our methods
                            differ principally because of differing responsibilities and estimates
                            of situation, that our methods can be brought to better focus of
                            complementarity, that India’s methods rely in large part on shield of
                            West’s defensive strength. President must obviously also discuss our
                            positions vis-à-vis Suez, the Middle East and Eastern Europe.</p>
                        <p>Believe unnecessary to suggest bases of President’s explaining our
                            policies re variety of matters on which he and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> cannot agree: Admission Red China
                            to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, military bases, security pacts,
                            military aid to Pakistan (latter three are inherent anyway in any
                            explanation US strategic concept). We do feel, however, that President
                            should discuss these issues in attempt to soften <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s position. Also believe
                            President should reiterate traditional American opposition to
                            colonialism and economic imperialism and should be prepared to discuss,
                            if raised by <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>, present US

                            that he should mention that private American capital might assist
                            India’s planning goals if Indian investment <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323"

                        <p>Issues to be raised by <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>:
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> can no doubt be relied
                            on to raise the gamut of issues mentioned above to which no agreement
                            can be reached and regarding which our maximum obtainable objective will
                            be to convince him of our peaceful goals and thus ameliorate his
                            criticism by enlarging his understanding of our motives and purposes.
                            The big question in our minds is whether <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> will ask specifically for US aid and whether the
                            initiative in raising India’s acute economic problems should be left to
                            him. We think it would be better for President to take initiative since
                            this could be done without committing ourselves and would simultaneously
                            pave the way to discussion of ways and means of composing policy
                            differences toward the end of achieving a climate of opinion which would
                            support large scale assistance to India.</p>
                        <p>It might be argued that it would be better for <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> to stew in his juice, swallow his
                            pride and either disclose his internal problem or fail to do so. The
                            larger question is whether this would necessarily serve our long-range
                            interests. If, as is assumed, we are vitally interested in preserving
                            democratic norms in India, there must be full and frank discussion of
                            the biggest immediate threat to those norms.</p>
                        <p>The threat, as we see it, is that India cannot (1) achieve its
                            socio-economic goals as rapidly as China and by democratic norms in the
                            absence of substantial foreign aid, and (2) India’s economic stability
                            will be in jeopardy by May 1957 as result depletion of foreign exchange
                            unless fairly immediate foreign economic assistance is forthcoming. We
                            think what <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> wishes most to
                            leave India is proof that India can modernize and industrialize under
                            democratic techniques. But, conditioned as he is with a colonial
                            psychosis and its overtones of economic imperialism, and dismayed as he
                            is with external and internal developments within recent months, he may
                            be too proud to risk an impression that he visits the US with a begging
                            bow. Nevertheless, fact that his entourage includes Five Year Plan
                            experts indicates his preparedness for economic discussions.</p>
                        <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0347"/>
                        <p>All things considered, we believe the better political and psychological
                            approach would be for the President to open the subject rather than run
                            risk that <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> might raise it
                            relatively late in the discussions and too late to permit President and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> and their advisors to
                            explore subject fully.</p>
                        <p>While <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> obviously has many
                            subjects other than his economic difficulties which he will wish to
                            discuss, we repeat that we think the economic development of India is
                            the primary motivation of his external and internal policies and that
                            perhaps best way of sharpening focus of talks, while easing <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s sensitivities, would be to
                            invite him fairly early to discuss his developmental plans and
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>Conclusions: We feel strongly that “moment of history” has arrived which
                            if seized and exploited, can give US much firmer anti-Communist and
                            anti-Red China counterpoise in India. We can, as it were, redress our
                            emphasis in Europe and on the periphery of Asia by more firmly
                            consolidating our position with Indian land power. We think this should
                            be possible without prejudicing our NATO and other pact relationships.
                            If India were convinced of our enduring interest in seeing her through
                            the critical years ahead, India might be expected to ameliorate some of
                            her present objections to American policy, especially as regards
                            Pakistan, <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, the Baghdad Pact.
                            Risks are involved but it appears to us that the risks are greater of
                            losing India through failure to exploit the opportunities now
                                presented.<note n="7" xml:id="d160fn7">The Embassy provided some

                                this was for the President to demonstrate an interest in India’s
                                economic difficulties and a willingness to explore means of dealing

                            following principal points emerged:</p>
                        <p>The President said that he had read several of the briefing papers which
                            had been sent over to him, and had talked with a number of people who
                            wished to give him their views as to how to deal with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>. He had been particularly
                            impressed with New Delhi’s recent telegram reporting the conversation of
                                <persName>Frank Moraes</persName>

                                corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>’s suggestion that he receive
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_CJS1">Cooper</persName> for a debriefing
                            on the Senator’s recent visit to India.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the briefing paper on a possible communiqué, the President
                            suggested that arrangements be made for a discussion of this matter by
                            the Secretary with <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> on
                            Tuesday following the President’s and <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName>’s return from Gettysburg. In this connection, he
                            commented that he might fly back from Gettysburg, thus arriving in
                            Washington about 10 a.m.</p>
                        <p>The President read the paper on the objectives of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> visit which had been expanded to
                            include the Secretary’s views. He commented that he did not consider
                                <gloss target="#t_GOA1">Goa</gloss> and Kashmir in the same category
                            as United States aid to Pakistan, insofar as his discussions with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> were concerned. He
                            thought he would take the position that the United States assumes an
                            impartial attitude concerning the former two questions, and not that we
                            should “agree to disagree”. The United States will deal with Pakistan
                            quite separately from its policies toward India, just as India has
                            decided to remain neutral as between the United States and the Soviet
                            Union. He thought that the main objective <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> would have in his visit would be as indicated in
                            the last item in the briefing paper, i.e., to obtain a Presidential
                            attitude favorable to the extension to India of a large scale United
                            States loan in the near future, plus the objective of demonstrating that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> is the outstanding
                            figure of Asia to whom the United States looks for wisdom and
                            counsel.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the briefing on the attitude which he might assume
                            concerning the prospects of American aid, the President thought that he
                            should not be too cool, although he would avoid any commitment. He
                            commented that a rebuff might result in <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> turning more sharply toward the Soviet Union. A
                            great problem in the question of aid to India would be Congress’
                            attitude in the light of Indian policies.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the briefing on Hungary, the President questioned the
                            wording “The United States is prepared to give careful consideration to
                            proposals for guaranteeing the neutrality of a new Hungary”. After some
                            discussion to clarify the meaning of this sentence, the President
                            suggested that the word “guaranteeing” be deleted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> suggested that the
                            President seek an opportunity during his talks with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> to build up the prestige of
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName>. The President
                            agreed to do so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> mentioned that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> had suggested that
                            the President seek particularly to impress upon <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> the sincerity and soundness of
                            our disarmament policy.</p>
                        <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0351"/>
                        <p>Commenting in more general terms about the meeting with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>, the President said that its main
                            utility would be to provide for a general discussion of matters of
                            common interest. With respect to particular propositions which might be
                            put up by <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>, he imagined that
                            he could do little more than listen. Any detailed discussions and
                            negotiations should be carried out at another level. He thought that he
                            was adequately briefed for his talks.</p>

                        <p>I reported briefly to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>
                            about the NATO Council meeting from which I had just returned. I
                            explained that there was considerable misunderstanding about our
                            attitude toward the attack on Egypt. The real basis for our complaint
                            was not failure to consult but the fact that the attack involved a
                            violation of the basic provisions of the United Nations Charter and the
                            North Atlantic Treaty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>
                            said that this point of view coincided with their own. Their objection
                            had not been failure to consult, although there had been such failure,
                            but the use of force as an instrument of national policy.</p>
                        <p>We discussed briefly the Chinese Communist situation. I said that before
                            there could be any change in our attitude there would have to be a
                            number of changes on the part of the Chinese Communist regime. At the
                            moment the sticking point was the ten Americans imprisoned. So long as
                            they were imprisoned we could not allow other Americans to visit despite
                            very strong pressures from our news-gathering agencies which have been
                            invited by Communist China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-Lai</persName> had indicated that there
                            were failures on our part. I denied this in some detail and suggested
                            that he check with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGL1"
                                >Mehta</persName>.</p>

                        <p>[In this connection I said that I was sorry to learn that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGL1">Mehta</persName> might be leaving.<note

                        <p>We discussed the Baghdad Pact. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> said that whatever had been the original intention
                            it had been diverted into Arab politics. He thought that the Iraq
                            Government was very unstable and unpopular and he hoped that the United
                            States would not be joining the Pact. This action might forfeit the
                            increasing esteem with which we were now held by the Arab peoples.</p>
                        <p>I said that there was considerable pressure to have us join the Pact at
                            the present time. It was still under consideration. Some [of our
                            Defense] people have felt that we should join to check Soviet aggression
                            in the area. The matter was still in abeyance and we recognized the
                            complications of Arab politics, of which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> spoke.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> said that just before he
                            left New Delhi he had had a message from the Government of Laos saying
                            they were greatly concerned that we had informed them that if they
                            carried out their agreement with the Pathet Laotians, we would cut off
                            our aid. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> said that
                            while undoubtedly there were some Communist elements in the Pathet group
                            the leader<note n="4" xml:id="d163fn4">Prince Souphanouvong.</note> was,
                            he thought, more of a nationalist than a Communist. I said that I was
                            not up to date on this matter, but I knew we felt that the entry of the
                            Pathet group into the government, particularly having regard to the
                            posts which they demanded, would quickly lead to a Communist takeover
                            and under those circumstances we were not interested in helping the
                            government economically and financially. I said I would look into the
                            matter and get up to date and advise him further before he left.</p>
                        <p>We discussed the European satellite situation. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> said that forces were at work
                            which demonstrated within Russia a desire for more security and freedom
                            and in the satellites for a greater recognition of their independence.
                            He did not think that the Communists had liquidated or could liquidate
                            the desire for nationalism.</p>
                        <p>I recalled the talk which I had had some months ago with the Yugoslav
                            Foreign Minister<note n="5" xml:id="d163fn5">Koča Popović.</note> where
                            he had said that there should be friendly governments around Russia. I
                            had agreed but said that unless the Russians move fast they would find
                            themselves surrounded by hostile peoples and, consequently, in the long
                            run, hostile governments. Events had demonstrated my point more rapidly
                            than I had expected. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>
                            agreed that the Russians had been too <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331"
                                facs="0353"/>slow to recognize nationalistic trends. He felt that
                            the present situation was fraught with danger and I said I had taken the
                            same position in my estimate of the world situation that I had given at
                            the NATO meeting.</p>

                                “pretty good,” noting that they were “in the realm of philosophy”
                                and “about India and its problems”. (Memorandum of telephone

                        <p>The President first asked him how his press conference had gone this
                            morning; the Prime Minister said very well, and they discussed the
                            mechanics for a moment or two.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had had a number of reports this morning from the
                            Mid East, some were quite hopeful. Said our Ambassador<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d164fn2">Raymond A. Hare.</note> had a long talk with Nasser
                            and found him more flexible than formerly and more nearly able to
                            recognize our viewpoint. He also said he had nothing particularly new to
                            add about Hungary. The Vice President is on his way there to see what
                            can be done to relieve the situation of refugees. The President would
                            like to see other countries take at least small numbers—mentioned South
                            America, where countries are underpopulated. He mentioned that there
                            seem to be a lot of professional people coming out of Hungary now. He
                            said Austria was glad to act as a temporary haven, but wants the
                            refugees out of there as soon as possible. Also, the Hungarians so far
                            want to continue on as fast as possible.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister suggested it might be better to support these people
                            in Austria; perhaps some day they could go home. The President said of
                            course it would be easier and less costly to support some of them in
                            Austria rather than bringing them over here, but the Austrians have been
                            urging that we increase our quota, which <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332"
                                facs="0354"/>the President has done to the extreme limit allowed by
                            law. He doesn’t think it would hurt us to take in 40 or 50 thousand.</p>
                        <p>In answer to a question from the Prime Minister, the President said he
                            thought there would be at least 150,000. The President said these
                            figures could be wrong, that he had not got the reports of his committee
                            yet.</p>
                        <p>The President replied to another question that he would not know of any
                            reason to oppose any (of the Hungarian refugees) from going back to
                            Hungary.</p>
                        <p>The President mentioned that he knew the Prime Minister was to see
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> this afternoon
                            and at that time they would work on the statement that will be released
                            at the conclusion of the Prime Minister’s visit. The President said he
                            would have no objection to whatever <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> and the State Department agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>The President said that, in looking back over their talks of Monday<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d164fn3">December 17.</note>, he was not sure that he
                            had made clear how much importance the United States attaches to the
                            reunification of Germany.</p>
                        <p>(<persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> replied.)</p>
                        <p>The President in answer said that he realized that Russia did a lot in
                            World War II and has certain legitimate fears—one of them was a
                            completely revitalized, belligerent Armed Germany. We have no intention
                            of allowing that to occur. That is one reason we never considered an
                            independent army for Germany, but only as a part of other nations that
                            have been equally abused by Germany and fearful of her. Actually, France
                            has far more reason to be frightened of Germany than has Russia—and we
                            don’t close our eyes to the fact that the Russian fears have some
                            reasonable basis—but we do think they have been very rigid in their
                            refusal to talk about any plan which could bring this about in a
                            framework of general European security. The President said also that in
                            October of 1955 we tried hard to get the Russians to go along with any
                            initial steps.</p>
                        <p>The President changed the subject, saying that since his visit with the
                            Prime Minister he had been parading his new knowledge of India and
                            Pakistan. He said as he looked back on their conversations he found them

                        <p>Nehru spoke at length. The President said that we have constantly
                            maintained that we are not seeking to assist Pakistan with any thought
                            that her strength vis-à-vis India should be increased.</p>
                        <p>He also stated that whenever we sold or gave arms to another country, it
                            was with the understanding that such arms should not be used
                            aggressively.</p>

                        <p>In response to a question, the President said that of course he wouldn’t
                            argue with the Prime Minister about Soviet motives because it is one
                            that has no proof. But their apparent desire to communize the world goes
                            along with the Marxist doctrine for world revolution of the
                            proletaria[t]. He said that now on the Prime Minister’s side of the
                            argument, when he used to talk, in the latter part of 1945 and early
                            part of 1946 with his good friend, Marshal Zhukov<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d164fn4">Georgi Konstantinovich Zhukov was Soviet head of
                                the Allied Control Commission in Germany 1945–1946, Commander in
                                Chief of Soviet Land Forces in 1946, and as of April of that year,
                                Deputy Minister of Soviet Armed Forces.</note> had always said, “All
                            we are interested in is that we have there a friendly government.” The
                            President—then the General—had replied that we want them to be the
                            friends (of the Russians) but were they going to be free and Zhukov’s
                            answer was, “Oh, yes, they would not be friendly otherwise.” So again it
                            is the old story of colonialism—that you cannot make friends by
                            dominating them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> answered, “That is true.”
                            And he went on with other remarks.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked if <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>
                            meant to suggest that the whole of Germany and of Eastern Europe should
                            be lumped together in a “neutral zone.” The President said that he
                            thought the only real flaw in such a hope was not that the West would
                            demand that Germany be with them, but he failed to see how a great
                            nation like Germany could be reduced to the point that it would be
                            merely the buffer—not even a buffer—sort of a vacuum between the West
                            and the East.</p>
                        <p>The President also pointed out—in reply to a question—that there was no
                            similarity between the relationship of West Germany and the allies on
                            the one hand, and Russia and the satellites on the other. One was a
                            forceful domination—the other a voluntary association.</p>
                        <p>If Adenauer<note n="5" xml:id="d164fn5">Konrad Adenauer, Chancellor of

                            Socialists who might want to take a neutral position, there would be no
                            answer on our part except to acknowledge their right to do so. He said
                            the Prime Minister did awaken in his mind this idea: Let there be a true
                            Warsaw Pact<note n="6" xml:id="d164fn6">For text of the Warsaw Pact, “On

                            Poland, Czechoslovakia, Roumania, Bulgaria and Hungary; let them make a
                            voluntary Pact among themselves for neutrality, not necessarily complete
                            disarmament, because normally a neutral nation has to make some effort
                            to protect its neutrality. But they could say: “We are neutral, we are
                            not West, we are not East, we are going to be friendly to all the
                            countries.”</p>
                        <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0356"/>
                        <p>The President said he thought that idea would begin to make some sense,
                            when approved by free election, and certainly it would conform to
                            everything we have said. All we want is for them the opportunity to
                            decide their own fate. If Germany chose to join such a Pact, we could
                            have nothing to say. The President said he cannot see how we could,
                            under the principles and policies under which we operate, take exception
                            to such a thing, if that is what they choose to do.</p>
                        <p>However, the President said—this cannot be tested now because the Eastern
                            governments are not free to act. He said he thought it would be a fine
                            idea to get those countries of Eastern Europe free enough to tell <hi
                                rend="italic">how</hi> they want to live. Certainly we have got to
                            explore every idea.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he could say frankly that we do not want our
                            troops abroad; to start with, no occupational troops have ever made
                            friends for the countries from whence they came. He said—consider our
                            troops. They are well paid; compared to the little shopkeepers and the
                            lower income people among whom they live, they are wealthy. That does
                            not create good will. We would like to get them back. As it is, nobody
                            living west of the Eisenach–Linz Line will agree to one single American
                            soldier coming home. When we sent them there, it was never considered to
                            be a permanent arrangement.</p>
                        <p>But aside from the certain sense of security Europeans gain from the
                            presence of the troops themselves, they constitute hostages—so the
                            countries of West Europe have a firm commitment that if those countries
                            are attacked, we are at their side. And so none of those nations want us
                            to withdraw our troops.</p>
                        <p>We do have difficulties. If one of the soldiers commits a crime in
                            Germany, it is a most complicated business. We have had trouble all over
                            the world because our government will not allow these troops to stay
                            unless we can assure them that the men (accused of crime) will be tried
                            by our system. Of course, when they are on leave and on the status of
                            any other tourist, then they are subject to the laws of the land in
                            which they are stationed.</p>
                        <p>The subject of disarmament came up. The President said that if we could
                            have confidence in the word of the Russians, if we could get hold of
                            anything that credited the Kremlin desire to be straightforward and
                            honest—we would not have so much trouble! But Russia is a very big
                            country that has not published a single word about its military
                            activities; or it says one thing one day and one the other. So when it
                            proposes that by decree “we will reduce our forces to such and such a
                            number and we will foreswear atomic rule,” no one can believe them. We
                            cannot go to our people and say, “You can trust that statement.”</p>

                        <p>The President said that the real reason for his Geneva open-skies

                                    >Eisenhower</persName>’s aerial inspection proposal made at
                                Geneva on July 21, 1955, is detailed in Department of State <hi
                                    rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, August 1, 1955, p. 174.</note> was
                            primarily to develop “mutual confidence”—to convince both sides that we
                            are not going to live under the threat of surprise attack, because this
                            kind of reconnaissance would prohibit it. Under that confidence, we
                            could go ahead. It was not in itself an answer to disarmament problems,
                            but he said also to the Russians if they wanted also their system of
                            inspection, which is detachments at ports, etc., he said he would accept
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Recently, in the last message we had from <persName corresp="#p_BMNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName>, he said the Soviets would accept aerial
                            inspection over a limited area on both sides of the East-West line in
                            Germany. He said, there is some little “give,” apparently, finally in
                            one of their messages.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> said he believed this to
                            indicate some real change in the Soviet attitude. The President said he
                            hoped so, because it would be dreadful if you didn’t have some hope and
                            faith. He is hopeful that it does mean some little realization on their
                            part that they can’t just sit there and say “Nyet, Nyet”—they have got
                            to do something! He said when he made his open-skies proposal, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BMNA1">Bulganin</persName> was sitting at the table and
                            received it with enthusiasm—apparently as far as the President could
                            see, the Soviets were hoping for some kind of an agreement and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BMNA1">Bulganin</persName> spoke of it in glowing
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>Then as we left the table, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> walked out of the room with the President and
                            said, “I don’t agree with our Chairman.” The President asked, “And why
                            not?” He said, “This is just an intelligent gimmick—this is just a way
                            to find out what we are doing.” The President said, “I am offering to
                            give you a pattern of what I am doing and then give you the inspectional
                            facilities to see whether I told you the truth.” Why doesn’t that create
                            confidence?</p>
                        <p>In any event <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> defied
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMNA1">Bulganin</persName>—but <persName
                                corresp="#p_BMNA1">Bulganin</persName>’s first reaction was
                            favorable. The President said he admitted that because of our defensive
                            arrangements, we give the Soviets cause for propaganda. Our bases and
                            our flights to places we have been inspecting (our planes are stationed
                            where they may sometimes in bad weather fly over Iron Curtain countries)
                            annoy the Russians. But we feel that if you have a nation that is
                            secretive with everything on the military end, the only thing you can do
                            is keep watching it all the time—we don’t know what else to do.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> spoke about a survey of
                            world economic needs.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that he had been talking about that to the
                            Secretary of State—and he has been searching for a good way to propose
                            something. He thinks that some proposal through the United Nations to
                            make an honest survey of the world economically—its <pb n="336"
                                xml:id="pg_336" facs="0358"/>resources and needs—and of the
                            legitimate ways in which any country can look to its friends for the
                            kind of help that they need, would be good.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, we might push technical aid. The President said he
                            understands that there is sometimes useless duplication; by and large we
                            have a very successful program. It is of no interference to anybody
                            because it is purely technical and professional.</p>
                        <p>We might do something to get a survey started and see what is the
                            response from the other side. The reason the President proposed his

                            try to develop self-reliance or self-support among nations.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we in the United States recognize clearly that if
                            all of Western Europe should fall to the Communists, then the Communists
                            would have the power to proceed with their threats against the rest of
                            the world. He said he is talking in the short-term military field. As
                            the Prime Minister had indicated, in the long run Communism really does
                            defeat itself. The President remarked that both France and Britain are
                            friends of ours.</p>
                        <p>The President mentioned his correspondence on Suez with Sir <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName>, which started as far back
                            as early July. He said that someday if he and Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> both were retired old gentlemen,
                            he would like to show him the letters. He said he feels that if anything
                            is as universal as our own country’s disapproval of any fighting over
                            this thing, he knows it is shared pretty well throughout the whole
                            world. We had this terrible problem, how to keep our friends from acting
                            aggressively, but yet not letting them go so far down the economic drain
                            as a result of their impulsiveness that they become prey to Communist
                            penetration!</p>
                        <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0359"/>
                        <p>The President went on to say that there is also a new factor, the one
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> pointed out the other
                            day. Russia was probably counting on a few extra divisions there in the
                            satellite countries. So we would have had to set aside an equal number
                            of divisions to keep them from causing trouble. The President said he
                            admits it is quite different, adding, “I don’t know what you think of
                            that.” The President thought of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> as a very fine, famous man, and always found his
                            associations with him most pleasant.</p>
                        <p>An interesting thing, said the President, is that atomic capability on
                            both sides of the Iron Curtain had more or less neutralized itself so
                            far as European thinking is concerned. So there has been a resurgence of
                            a feeling of dependence, particularly in Germany, on conventional arms.
                            He said Chancellor Adenauer today is pushing us harder than ever for
                            more forces; sends us the most extraordinary messages, to the effect
                            that we are running out on them, disturbing their people, making it more
                            difficult for him. He has gotten very upset about it.</p>
                        <p>Saudi Arabia. In this latest ramification, in the last year, time and
                            again we told King Saud exactly what we are doing. He still says that
                            our kind of talk is making it difficult for him politically.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister talked at length, mentioning the name of <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-Lai</persName>. The President said that is
                            number one priority. He spoke of the incident of the invitation for
                            newspapermen to go over there, and our thought that, step by step, we
                            might have been able to reach some kind of modus vivendi.</p>
                        <p>The President spoke of his conversations with Chiang Kai-Shek.<note
                                n="10" xml:id="d164fn10">President of the Republic of China.</note>
                            When he visited there right after the War, he was impressed to hear
                            everybody talking perfectly freely, and that they seemed to like “having
                            us around.” They put the President in the most beautiful quarters he has
                            ever been in. There seemed no danger, or no thought of any molestation
                            or interference. The President said that he, for one, was particularly
                            shocked when we saw developing in the country those terrible pictures of
                            United States victims.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would like to get our people over their currently
                            very adverse attitude toward Red China. They put Red China at the bottom
                            of the list, even below Russia, which he does not understand—but that it
                            is true. He thinks most of it is about the ten prisoners and the fact,
                            as he had told <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> the other
                            day, of the casualties suffered in Korea. Our people are sensitive—in
                            World War II, they thought that it was something that had to be fought.
                            He said he never heard discussed so much the theories of World War II as
                            of the casualties of Korea. So the President thinks the main thing from
                            our side is (a) the ten prisoners, and (b) Korea.</p>
                        <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0360"/>
                        <p>With those things straightened out, we would of course naturally do
                            something with our public opinion here; secondly, we could do something,
                            as the President had said before, about sending newspapermen over there
                            who would begin to find out what they are thinking. There would then be
                            a flow of news coming back that would tend to ameliorate this uneasy
                            state of pandemonium. And there could, out of such a small achievement
                            as this, spring something very fine.</p>
                        <p>But the President’s feeling, as of this moment, is that it is impossible
                            for us to take the first step. He said <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Foster Dulles</persName> may have a different view, but that this
                            is his own feeling.</p>
                        <p>The President told <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> that he
                            is a man who is without personal ambition whatsoever. He has no ambition
                            left in the world except to leave a record—not a personal record, but a
                            knowledge that something has been advanced to help the cause of peace in
                            the world.</p>
                        <p>The President told the Prime Minister he would not have stayed in this
                            position had people in the Administration not insisted that it would be
                            wrong to make a change at this moment when we have so many critical
                            things started in the world—and their insistence that he just had to try
                            to carry on. (The President personally feels it might be nice to just
                            sit on the farm, play a little golf, and call it a day.) But if the
                            President could help to ease the tension, so that finally we could work
                            out the details, raise living standards, and bring about greater
                            happiness—that is the only thing he could possibly look forward to.</p>
                        <p>So the President is willing to do anything, go anywhere, provided he can
                            be shown that it would help rather than exacerbate the situation.
                            Sometimes one may go, when so much is expected, and there turns out to
                            be a collapse of effort when a miracle is not produced overnight. Before
                            taking any such move, the President would want to be sure it would
                            advance the cause of world understanding a little bit.</p>
                        <p>The President told of his having left a sick bed to go to the conferences
                            at Panama<note n="11" xml:id="d164fn11">After his ileitis attack, the
                                President attended the meeting of the Presidents of the American
                                Republics in Panama in July 1956.</note>—though he added that he did
                            think it helped put him back in the harness again, that he improved
                            steadily since that trip.</p>
                        <p>The President looks forward to seeing <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> again this evening (dinner at Embassy). He did
                            want to tell him how much he derived from this meeting—has gained much,
                            he is sure, in understanding that will be helpful. He looks forward—as
                            he hopes <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> does—to personal
                            correspondence, for which he thinks this meeting has <pb n="339"
                                xml:id="pg_339" facs="0361"/>opened the possibility. He mentioned
                            that there are a number of Heads of State with whom he now corresponds,
                            and once a personal contact has been opened up, it is possible. One to
                            whom he does write is the King of Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>The President continued: “So if at any time you have an idea,
                            particularly this line you were talking of something you would now wish
                            to get that might come better say from a country like ours—particularly
                            if there were some kind of investment or money involved that we could
                            provide and that would come better from us—you make the request and I
                            will certainly give it every possible consideration. Because I expect
                            the same thing.”</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister thanked the President. His statement concluded with,
                            “as to what we should do about guns.”</p>
                        <p>The President recalled the Prime Minister’s having raised that question
                                before,<note n="12" xml:id="d164fn12">Reference is to <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOA1">Goa</gloss>.</note> and said he has thought
                            about it a great deal. He said this is one question on which we have
                            tried as usual to remain a friend of both sides. At this moment of
                            course Portugal is a member of NATO. And we have a base on the Azores.
                            That is about our relationship with them. The President thinks we have
                            no particular trade—said something about size and population.</p>
                        <p>The President does not know how acute this is in India’s public opinion
                            today—but said that we are trying to straighten out the Mid East and get
                            the Canal operating, which he thinks is just as important to India as it
                            is to Western Europe and to us. He said we are trying to take advantage
                            of what we believe to be a very great adversity to the Communist
                            dictator pressures and objectives. He thinks if <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> could hold off a little bit and
                            defer moving on <gloss target="#t_GOA1">Goa</gloss> in any way, it would
                            be better to bring up now [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. The President
                            wanted it understood that he was merely “talking off the top of his
                            head”—first of all, as he said before, he does not know how really
                            deeply this matter affects Indian public opinion throughout the
                            nation—and if it is as urgent as he thinks it is, of course <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> cannot defer it, but would have
                            to do something.</p>
                        <p>After <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> spoke, the President
                            next said he thinks that here is a specific thing about which he can
                            talk to <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster Dulles</persName>, something
                            that would tend to reduce tension—because Portugal, however spurious
                            their claim, would not be abandoning their own claims…<note n="13"
                                xml:id="d164fn13">Ellipsis in the source text.</note></p>
                        <p>The President recalled that <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>
                            told him there was a question of income and money, which he at first
                            said he would take up with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>. Then he added the suggestion that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> himself bring it up when he sees
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> this afternoon.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> said he <pb n="340"
                                xml:id="pg_340" facs="0362"/>already has mentioned it to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. The President then
                            asked, “Did you mention these prisoners?” (<persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> talked at some length.)</p>
                        <p>The President said that if any nation uses aggressively any arms ever
                            given to them by the United States, they are going to be in trouble with
                            us. This does not mean that we would go to war, but the first thing we
                            would do would be to stop any further shipments to them. We have always
                            been very careful not to give great stocks of ammunition, so that no one
                            can go too far astray. On top of that, the pressure would be put upon
                            them, because we have been helping them economically as well as
                            militarily. The President said he cannot insure that we would never
                            support them, but we would oppose and try to block any such move as, for
                            example, Russia coming into the Mid East.</p>
                        <p>The President asked the question, “Is Kashmir the real bone of
                            contention, or is that only a manifestation of the country?”</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister replied, then apparently changed the subject. The
                            President’s next statement was that he will give the subject some
                            thought and will try to produce an idea. But, he said, we would not want
                            to be pushing ourselves forward as a mediator in such a thing.</p>
                        <p>The President hoped the Prime Minister enjoyed his stay; said his travel
                            arrangements are all set, that he need not worry about a thing on

                            Minister for India. The Ambassador then expressed his appreciation of
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s recent speech at
                            Arnold House on foreign aid. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> believed that the conference had been generally
                            successful and commented that all groups which had recently studied
                            foreign aid had reached substantially similar conclusions. He hoped that
                            after President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            addresses the nation on this subject next week,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d165fn2">On May 21, the President addressed the American
                                people on the need for mutual security in waging the peace. In his
                                speech he noted that countries like India and Pakistan had with
                                great difficulty been applying considerable portions of their
                                limited resources to long-range investment. “But at this critical
                                moment of their economic growth a relatively small amount of outside
                                capital can fatefully decide the difference between success and
                                failure. What is critical now is to start and to maintain momentum.”

                            Congressional action will be favorable.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGL1">Mehta</persName> recalled that
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>, in speaking
                            to the Far East-America Council of Commerce and Industry, during his
                            recent trip, had said that India’s approach to economic problems was not
                            doctrinaire but pragmatic with the exception of India’s insistence on
                            maintaining a democratic approach on both political and economic
                            matters. India has no plans, for example, for the collectivization of
                            agriculture and recognizes clearly the important part played by private
                            enterprise in her economy.</p>
                        <p>Despite the success of India’s First Five Year Plan, baffling problems
                            remain in the accomplishment of India’s development program.
                            Nevertheless, India’s leaders realize that the impact of this program
                            must be adequate to alleviate unemployment and increase the pace of
                            industrialization. In the first year of the Second Five Year Plan,
                            however, appreciable strains have developed on prices and balance of
                            payments. Even if this plan is successful, the standard of living will
                            rise only slightly.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador then inquired whether Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> had conveyed to the Department
                            any suggestions for informal talks between the Indian Embassy and the
                            Department on long-term loan assistance to India. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied that the Embassy had
                            reported a number of conversations held between Embassy personnel and
                            Indian officials on the subject of India’s development program, but that
                            no request for talks had been indicated.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that at luncheon on the first day of Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s visit, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had questioned him
                            on the Five Year Plan and that the Prime Minister had given a detailed
                            explanation. Subsequently, the Prime Minister, in a press conference,
                            had said that India would welcome long-term loan assistance indicating
                            that loans were a good form of aid in that they encouraged self-respect.
                            While on his recent visit to India, the Ambassador said that he had had
                            talks with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BFP1">Bartlett</persName> and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> who had
                            suggested that informal talks on the possibility of assistance be held
                            before any formal approach to the U.S. Government is made by the
                            Government of India. The Ambassador hopes to continue these discussions
                            with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> on the
                            latter’s return for consultation.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then raised a direct question whether an informal approach
                            should be made to see if formal talks should be held later. He expects
                            the Indian Finance Minister to be in Washington in the fall for talks
                            with the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">B.K.
                                Nehru</persName>, Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, will be in
                            Washington on May 16 for talks with the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                                >IBRD</gloss> and will be in a position to supply the latest
                            material for the information of the Department. The Ambassador frankly
                            stated, that unless the ground is prepared carefully, he could see no
                            point to a formal request by India which might raise, unnecessarily,
                            controversy between the two governments or invite a rebuff. He recalled
                            the long debate over the wheat loan to India in 1951. He hoped that
                            there would be no publicity on any informal talks that might take
                            place.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the U.S.
                            obviously is interested in the future of India and its economy as
                            indicated by the U.S. aid now being given. The question is, therefore,
                            one of amount and not of principle. He did not believe that it would be
                            possible to make any firm judgments until the nature of the new aid
                            legislation is more definitely known, although he hoped that the concept
                            of longer-range planning of assistance would be accepted by the U.S.
                            Congress. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> expressed
                            the opinion that it would be helpful to have informal discussions and to
                            determine more clearly India’s view of her economic problems.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> indicated that the U.S.
                            Government has made some studies based on available public
                                information.<note n="3" xml:id="d165fn3">On February 4, <persName

                            passed, in about two months, the U.S. Government would be in a better

                            had been made only on available published data. The Ambassador then
                            inquired as to whom <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">B. K. Nehru</persName>
                            should see for technical discussions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> agreed to receive Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName>, but suggested that technical talks could
                            appropriately be held with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWV1"
                                >Turnage</persName> of <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SRB1">R. B. Smith</persName> of <gloss
                                target="#t_SOA1">SOA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGL1">Mehta</persName> then referred to
                            India’s attempts to attract private capital. He said that in the past
                            ten years, U.S. investments in India had increased from the $25 million
                            level to $100 million and that a number of new investment schemes were
                            under consideration. British and German private companies are also
                            cooperating with the <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0366"/>Government
                            of India which is very keen to assist in attracting private capital. As
                            evidence, he said that from a total of $230 million borrowed by India
                            from the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, approximately $150
                            million had been utilized for loans to private Indian companies. Thus,
                            India is not stifling the private sector, although it does have problems
                            of regulation and of meeting demands for protection from its own
                            industrialists. He also referred to India’s repayment of its lend-lease
                            silver debt as evidence of India’s good faith in international financial
                                transactions.<note n="4" xml:id="d165fn4">The first installment of
                                India’s lend-lease silver repayment was shipped to the United States
                                on April 24. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1"
                                >Bunker</persName>, like Cooper before him, had urged a long-term
                                moratorium. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> informed
                                him April 24 of the reasons why the Department could not go along
                                with his recommendation. (Department of State, Central Files,

                            by stating that India’s present position was extremely difficult. Apart
                            from the serious financial and economic situation, it was essential from
                            a political and social viewpoint for development to go <pb n="345"
                                xml:id="pg_345" facs="0367"/>forward. If stability is to be
                            preserved in a democracy it is essential that visible progress be shown
                            to the people.</p>
                        <p>This was the basic purpose of the Second Five-Year Plan, but India has
                            found that it lacks the necessary resources to carry it through. Over
                            the period of the Second Five-Year Plan India faces a total foreign
                            exchange gap of approximately $3 billion. Committed external assistance
                            and the planned reduction in India’s foreign exchange reserves would
                            reduce this deficit to approximately $1.9 billion. The planned reduction
                            of $400 million in reserves has already been exceeded, since India has
                            used $650 million of reserves since April, 1956. India has already drawn
                            $1271/2 million from the International Monetary Fund. Nevertheless, well
                            before the end of this year Indian reserves will be reduced to their
                            legal minimum. While India has the authority to go below this level
                            temporarily, to do so would raise grave questions of the stability of
                            its money.</p>
                        <p>If India’s expectations of additional aid from the <gloss
                                target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, the US, the Colombo Plan, private
                            foreign investment, and the new Russian credit are taken into account,
                            the foreign exchange gap is reduced to about $700 million. However, new
                            difficulties are arising. The <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> has
                            made no financial commitments as yet. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1"
                                >Black</persName> has offered only $75 million now for India’s
                            railroads, as against commitments already made by India of $150 million.
                            Furthermore, the Plan calls for additional commitments of $280 for
                            railroads by the end of this year. According to the <gloss
                                target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, the supply of money is tight and
                            India is unpopular in the money market.</p>
                        <p>Faced with these problems, India has declared a complete embargo on any
                            new capital development unless it is self liquidating in foreign
                            exchange terms. This applies to both the public and the private sectors.
                            In addition, projects are being slowed down wherever possible. However,
                            the bulk of the Five-Year Plan undertakings are started, and commitments
                            on these projects are so large that it will be most difficult to finance
                            even those presently under way. If development is limited to present
                            projects, the rate of development will be too slow to meet India’s
                            political requirements. If it is assumed that the <gloss
                                target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> loans India not the $600 million
                            anticipated but only $400 million, India’s foreign exchange gap will
                            amount to approximately $1 billion.</p>
                        <p>In view of this situation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> had been asked by his Government to raise with the
                            US the question of additional financial assistance. He recognized that
                            any specific legislation in favor of India would have difficulty in
                            Congress. As to alternatives he suggested the possibility that further
                            PL 480 assistance might be extended and that India might obtain a larger
                            share of the proposed Development Fund. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> asked whether additional PL 480 assistance would
                            substitute for planned requirements. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName>
                            <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0368"/>replied that India has had to
                            increase its planned imports of food and agricultural products to meet
                            consumer demands, and that PL 480 assistance would therefore reduce the
                            demand for foreign exchange for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> summarized his
                            presentation by stating that the problem was not only one of the amount
                            of resources but also that of the speed with which additional funds
                            could be found. In his view, India could not tamper with reserves and
                            jeopardize the position of the rupee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> complimented Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s remarkable knowledge
                            of US aid programs and of the situation in this country. Studies
                            undertaken recently of foreign aid resulted in a widespread acceptance
                            that such assistance is worth while in and of itself. The proposed
                            Development Fund will provide aid assurance over a longer term. It is
                            probable that the projects to be financed will be considered on a basis
                            similar to that of the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>. The form
                            of the Development Fund will make it easier to give a disproportionate
                            share in any one year to a particular country than is now possible with
                            country programs. This change in US aid procedures should be welcomed by
                            India. While recognizing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName>’s desire for quick action, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out that we will not
                            know how much is available until the Congress completes its action,
                            perhaps by August first, at which time we could begin to make plans.
                            While the amount to be made available to India will, of course, be
                            further studied, he indicated that since India has many projects in an
                            advanced state this should place India in a favorable position. It is
                            obvious that even a disproportionately large share of the $500 million
                            requested for fiscal ’58 would not come near to filling India’s gap.
                            However, additional funds will be available in succeeding years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> indicated that
                            Congressional action on a new PL 480 legislation authorizing $1 billion
                            should be completed in about two weeks. However, the US has applications
                            in excess of that amount. Nevertheless, it would not be unreasonable to
                            think that India might obtain some additional aid from this source.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> that special loan
                            legislation is not practicable now. In the first place, there is a
                            strong economy drive in Congress. Consequently, it would not be
                            advisable to take up special legislation at the time new general aid is
                            in progress. However, if the Administration’s aid proposal is accepted,
                            it will mean that the general idea of development assistance has been
                            advanced and that the general atmosphere may be more favorable than it
                            is now. Special action for India, however, could not be considered for
                            at least a year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> indicated that any
                            further information Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>
                            wished to give us would be helpful. He informed Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> that <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347"
                                facs="0369"/>the US had made a study of India’s Second Five-Year
                            Plan which indicated a gap in foreign exchange resources of $600 to $900
                            million. However, this was based on many estimates and left many
                            questions unanswered. Consequently, further technical discussion while
                            aid legislation is in progress would be helpful, particularly to
                            determine the particular timing problems to which Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> had referred. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> also indicated that the new
                            Development Fund might be closely coordinated with the <gloss
                                target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> loans and consequently might permit a
                            larger volume of such <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> loans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> inquired whether it was
                            accurate then to summarize the US position, as that we would not know
                            our situation for another six weeks but that the US desired in the
                            meantime to get at the facts. He indicated that it was difficult for him
                            to carry all the factual material with him but that the <gloss
                                target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> is fully informed. He suggested
                            therefore that he request the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> to
                            make all the information that it has available to the US Government.
                            Secondly, he inquired whether it would be possible for the US to spare
                            an expert to go to India to consult with their personnel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> reiterated the urgency
                            of India’s need and indicated that India would be favorably placed to
                            present projects immediately to the US for consideration. He also
                            expressed the hope that the new aid legislation would make it possible
                            for the US to finance parts of old projects as well as new. India’s
                            urgent need is to complete the financing on high priority projects now
                            under way. He inquired whether US loans under the aid fund would be as
                            hard as those of the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied that our loans
                            would not be on the same basis as the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                                >IBRD</gloss> but that the legislation provided for considerable
                            flexibility with regard to the currency of repayment and the timing. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> emphasized that if it
                            was determined to be desirable for an American to go to Delhi this could
                            be done quietly without any commitment or publicity, and that India
                            would never attempt to take advantage of the US in these
                            consultations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then referred to the
                            appointment of Mr. Winthrop Brown, formerly Economic Counselor in
                            London, as Deputy Chief of Mission in Delhi as evidence of US
                            recognition of the importance of India’s financial problems. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> inquired when the
                            Development Fund would be in operation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> replied that if the law was passed by the first
                            of August there would then be a transition period while new procedures
                            were being developed, lasting for perhaps six months.<note n="3"

                                14 (71 Stat. 355).</note></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> finally suggested that
                            any influence the US might bring to bear on the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                                >IBRD</gloss> with regard to larger loans to India would <pb n="348"
                                xml:id="pg_348" facs="0370"/>be helpful. <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                                >IBRD</gloss> loans to India amount to 56 cents per capita as
                            compared to $34.50 per capita to Australia. In his view, US support
                            might make Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> feel more
                            secure in increasing bank credit to India.</p>

                        <p>I talked to so many people in the Administration, the Department, and in
                            the Senate and House that I hardly know where to begin. I think perhaps
                            my narrative will be clearer if I discuss these under a number of

                        <p>The greater part of my time was devoted to this subject. I talked with
                            the President, with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>,
                            Clarence Randall, <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Chris Herter</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Sherman Adams</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Douglas Dillon</persName> (with Win Brown),
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">John Hollister</persName>, <persName

                            others in South Asia.</p>
                        <p>I found the President looking extremely well,<note n="2" xml:id="d167fn2"
                                    ><persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> met with the

                            receptive to what I had to say. I had time to explain why I thought we
                            were heading into a crucial period here in the immediate future and what
                            it could mean to our long-term interests here and in Asia. I felt that I
                            had a sympathetic hearing. The President again expressed the view that
                            he felt we were better off with India following its policy of
                            non-alignment than were she to join up actively on our side, with the
                            consequent added burden on the American taxpayer and 2000 miles more of
                            active frontier. He, of course, <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0371"
                            />made no commitment as to what, if anything, might be done in the way
                            of extraordinary assistance to India.</p>
                        <p>Following my talk with the President, I had a long talk with Clarence
                            Randall, who impressed me greatly. He seems to be intensely interested
                            in his subject, to have an excellent grasp of it, and asks questions
                            which make a lot of sense. Randall had first asked, as you know, for a
                            study of the Indian situation, this at the suggestion of the President.
                            He has now asked the Department to come up with recommendations.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SRB1">Burr Smith</persName> and others in
                                <gloss target="#t_SOA1">SOA</gloss> were working on these at the
                            time I left and I had an opportunity to go over the ground a little with
                            them. My only fear is that what they come up with may be too cautious
                            and lukewarm.</p>
                        <p>I also covered the ground as thoroughly as I could with <persName

                                    >Jones</persName> on June 4 to discuss India’s financial
                                problems. He emphasized that how India fared economically over the
                                next few years would be most important to the United States. The
                                Secretary mentioned that money was tight and there was Congressional
                                resistance to aid programs. He hoped that India might qualify for
                                assistance from the new Development Loan Fund. Finally, <persName

                            clearly about it, and I felt would be willing to back what action he
                            thought necessary even though it might be difficult.</p>

                            the ground that with all the unemployment in India, spending a million

                            Reports are current that <persName corresp="#p_HJB1"

                            aid bill is passed.</p>
                        <p>The upshot of all these talks and a pretty thorough review with <gloss
                                target="#t_SOA1">SOA</gloss> led me to come to the reluctant
                            conclusion that there is practically no prospect of any legislative
                            action on a loan or credit to India in this session of Congress. The
                            budget fight is still on and the Administration has not yet won it by
                            any means. It got over the <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0372"
                            />first hurdle on foreign aid in the Senate extremely well but there is
                            yet to come action by the Appropriations Committee. Hearings are still
                            going on in the House on the Authorization Bill. Added up, this means
                            that it will be near the end of the session before final action is taken
                            on the authorization and appropriations. This would leave little time
                            for Congressional action on a special measure which would undoubtedly be
                            controversial and which could only hope to succeed with the strongest
                            kind of backing from the President and the Secretary. I do not believe
                            this would be forthcoming unless we were faced with an imminent collapse
                            here.</p>
                        <p>There is the added problem in connection with special legislation for
                            India that there are other countries, such as France, which are facing
                            extremely difficult economic and financial problems and feel that they
                            also should have special attention. There was also a feeling that India
                            has overreached itself in the second Plan. This I think is true and I am
                            quite sure that the Plan will not be completed within five years.
                            Nevertheless it is also true that India will need more assistance than
                            will be available under the presently contemplated Mutual Assistance
                            program.</p>

                            the House I saw <persName>John McCormick</persName>, the Majority
                            leader. Since the Foreign <gloss target="#t_AID1">Aid</gloss> Bill was
                            then under consideration by the Committee, I had the opportunity to add
                            what I could toward urging that the development fund be kept intact and
                            to emphasize again the critical situation we are facing in India and the
                            need to do something about it in our own vital interests. Taken all
                            together I found a more sympathetic response toward the Indian situation
                            than I had expected. There is, of course, in many quarters great
                            resentment at <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> but,
                            nevertheless, a realization of the importance of India to us and the
                            need to give assistance. Except for <persName corresp="#p_CJS1">John
                                Cooper</persName>, however, I found the same reaction as I had
                            received from the Administration, i.e., that it would be extremely
                            difficult, if not impossible, to get special legislation in this
                            session. <persName corresp="#p_CJS1">John Cooper</persName> was more
                            optimistic than the others and felt that if the President and Secretary
                            were to strongly back a recommendation it might be possible to get
                            through a loan to India of say $200,000,000. He prefaced this by saying
                            that a strong support of the President and Secretary would be absolutely
                            essential. Under present conditions I do not believe this would be
                            forthcoming. <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0373"/>Unanimity of
                            opinion on the other side was so complete that I felt it would not be
                            productive to try to force the issue further.</p>
                        <p>I talked this over several times with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGL1">Mehta</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >B.K. Nehru</persName> and found that their independent appraisal
                            coincided with mine. With the short time available for any such action
                            there is the added risk that the matter might be proposed and fail to
                            get favorable action. Then we would be left with a situation in which
                            many harsh things would have been said about India (which would be
                            inevitable in any event) but with no offsetting constructive results to
                            show for our efforts.</p>

                        <p>On my arrival I found <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">B.K. Nehru</persName>
                            greatly discouraged about his negotiations with the Bank. He had hoped
                            to get a loan of $125,000,000 for the railroads, and the Bank countered
                            with an offer of $75,000,000. He felt that this left him in an extremely
                            awkward position, for he has commitments to meet over the next year for
                            the larger amount. I subsequently talked with <persName

                                xml:id="d167fn6"><persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName>
                                discussed the Indian aid question with <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                    >Dillon</persName> on June 24 remarking that it was not likely
                                that the United States could meet India’s valid assistance needs
                                without special legislation. He suggested that if Congress would
                                permit India to repay the dollar wheat loan of 1951 in local
                                currency at a higher rate of interest, then the World Bank would
                                consider an equivalent dollar development loan of perhaps $125
                                million. (Memorandum of conversation by <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"

                            <persName>Burke Knapp</persName> and <persName>Rushinsky</persName> [<hi

                            and they outlined to me what they were proposing to do for India in the
                            way of loans this year. These included the $75,000,000 for the
                            railroads, $10,000,000 for the Trombay power plant near Bombay, and a
                            further loan of $17,500,000 to Tata for additional expansion, making a
                            total of 102.5 millions. They felt this was as far as they could go,
                            pointing out that this would put India right at the top of their
                            borrowers, and that the only money they could lend was what they
                            themselves could borrow. They had some trouble selling the last $100
                            millions of bonds on the New York market. After talking with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">B.K. Nehru</persName> again, I urged the Bank to
                            increase their loan for the railroads to $100,000,000, taking the
                            increase off what they might lend in subsequent years. I doubt very
                            much, however, that they will do this for I think they feel that
                            $100,000,000 is about as much as they can do in any one year for India.
                            They also pointed out that their actual payments this year to India
                            would amount to about $150,000,000.</p>

                        <p>I had a session with <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Sam Waugh</persName> and
                            the Board of the <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> Bank. It
                            developed that they really had no policy as far as India is <pb n="352"
                                xml:id="pg_352" facs="0374"/>concerned and asked what I thought they
                            could do. I said I felt that there was no point in getting into
                            competition with the World Bank by loaning money to projects where the
                            credit of the Indian Government was involved. This would only mean that
                            the World Bank would reduce its lending and India would be no better
                            off. I said I thought that they could be useful, however, in two types
                            of projects. One instance would be where American firms were willing to
                            invest in India but would not want to put up their own equity capital.
                            In such cases they might be willing to borrow on their own credit from
                            the <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> Bank. The second instance
                            might involve a situation in which savings in foreign exchange would be
                            large enough to offset the capital investment over a period of years,
                            and thus the borrowing ability of the Indian Government would not be
                            compromised. The Reynolds Aluminum project might be a case in point.

                        <p>It seems pretty well assured that the PL 480 extension for $1,000,000,000
                            will go through. It is doubtful, however, if India will be able to share
                            in much of this because of her present loan. The feeling in Congress
                            seemed to be that PL 480 will be extended from year to year as long as
                            there are farm surpluses, although I understand the Administration is
                            not very enthusiastic about the project. However, I think there will be
                            pressure to keep it going as long as the surpluses continue. In this
                            case India might come in for larger shares in subsequent years.</p>

                        <p>1. U.S. operations should be developed in accordance with U.S. objectives
                            which are: the continuance of non-Communist governments willing and able
                            to resist Communist blandishments or pressures from within and without;
                            an increased association and identification with other South Asian
                            governments, and peoples, and with the free world community; a lessening
                            of the tensions with other South Asian states in order to augment their
                            resistance to Communist tactics and to strengthen their bonds with the
                            free world; strong, stable and, if possible, popularly-based
                            governments; increasingly sound and developed economies, and a posture
                            of military strength contributing to area stability and as appropriate
                            to the defense of the free world.</p>

                            with India that it is not merely the largest of the less developed
                            countries, but is very important in itself to United States policy. It
                            is one of the leading powers of the world and stands preeminent among
                            the free Asian-African countries. With a population approaching 400
                            millions, it encompasses one out of every seven persons in the
                            world.</p>

                        <p>Communist China’s tacit yet certain rivalry with India is one of the
                            basic facts of Asian politics. Its implication to United States policy
                            and operations lies in the inevitable comparison that will be made
                            between the two countries’ progress—the one depending upon totalitarian
                            controls and devices, and the other relying on democratic processes and
                            methods. The outcome of the race could have a very considerable effect
                            on the other and much smaller Asian countries. India is deeply and
                            officially committed to an “independent” foreign policy amounting to
                            neutralism between the Communist bloc and the West. Equally, if not more
                            important, the United States is committed to support its ally Pakistan
                            against Communist aggression, and India has interpreted this commitment
                            as a potential danger to India’s security. The intensity of India’s
                            resentment of this alliance is a reflection of age-old communal tensions
                            between Hindus and Muslims, greatly exacerbated by the partition of the
                            subcontinent and the ensuing, bitter Kashmir dispute. There appears to
                            be no easy “out” to the dilemma, but with patience there may be a chance
                            eventually to persuade India that its oft expressed fears of the misuse
                            of United States military aid to Pakistan in aggressive action against
                            India are unfounded and indeed harmful to India’s aspirations for a
                            reputation of objectivity.</p>
                        <p>In spite of the conflict between certain U.S. and Indian policy
                            objectives, there are many lines of parallel action: to stand against
                            further Communist expansion; to limit Chinese Communist influence in
                            South and Southeast Asia; to limit Soviet influence in the Near East and
                            Africa; and to foster regional cooperation among the non-Communist
                            countries of both continents. India of course hopes to extend and
                            strengthen its ties with its smaller neighbors generally. While an
                            Indian “sphere of influence” would not necessarily be consistent with
                            United States aims, no serious problem is posed to present American
                            policy so long as India remains non-Communist and democratically
                            oriented. On the contrary, Indian influence contributes to the stability
                            of parts of Free Asia. This applies particularly to the land-locked
                            Kingdom of Nepal, where practically all free world activity is
                            physically dependent upon a cooperative attitude on the part of the
                            Government of India.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Nepal</hi>. Nepal, by virtue of its geographic
                            position relative to India and Communist China, merits attention. Since
                            1951, India has had a dominating influence over Nepalese politics.
                            However, long established Nepalese ties with Tibet and Nepalese dislike
                            of occasionally heavy-handed Indian “protection” have inspired Nepal to
                            seek closer relations with the Chinese Communists. During the past year
                            and a half relations between Communist China and Nepal have become
                            closer.</p>
                        <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0377"/>
                        <p>United States policy and operations toward the buffer state of Nepal
                            should take into consideration the objectives we have with regard to
                            India and Communist China. Since India looks upon all foreign influence
                            in Nepal with some suspicion, the United States must pursue its
                            objectives tactfully and carefully, not appearing to usurp India’s
                            special position. Similarly, the United States should regulate its
                            activity in Nepal so as not to encourage the Chinese Communists to
                            expand their operations there.</p>

                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">US-India Economic Relations</hi>. In the absence of
                            strong U.S. Indian political or military ties, economic relations
                            between the two countries assume a special importance. The United States
                            has relatively little “leverage” on India apart from India’s need for
                            greater foreign economic assistance. The present level of U.S.
                            assistance, though substantial, is small in comparison with India’s
                            total economic development expenditure and can exert little if any
                            influence on its policy outlook. The same applies to the present level
                            of Communist bloc economic assistance to India. It is not clear whether
                            any increase in magnitude would have any effect on India’s policy
                            outlook.</p>
                        <p>Success of the Government of India in attaining its present economic
                            goals, as reflected principally in its Second Five-Year Plan (1956–61)
                            would do much to assure that India will remain non-Communist in the
                            foreseeable future. Failure to achieve the Plan on schedule would tend
                            to weaken the moderate elements in India, and increase the chances that
                            extremist elements would eventually come to power. Such a development
                            could result in a setback to the attainment of United States objectives
                            in the area.</p>
                        <p>Present prospects are that, in the absence of greater foreign exchange
                            resources, the goals of India’s Second Five-year Plan will have to be
                            lowered. Our stake in India’s future economic and political development
                            requires that Indian economic problems be kept under continuing review
                            from the standpoint of the United States interests involved.</p>
                        <p>In this connection a special study has been prepared by an
                            interdepartmental working group. This study has been submitted to the
                            President. The Department, in consultation with the Departments of the

                        <p>India has agreed with the United States to buy for rupees $360 million
                            worth of surplus commodities, chiefly foodgrains with 20 per cent of the
                            sales proceeds to be reserved for U.S. uses. The balance is to be lent
                            to India for developmental purposes, and $55 million of this balance is
                            to be made available through private banking channels to private
                            enterprise for expansion purposes. Although the agreement provides for
                            shipments over a three-year period, in the first 10 months of the
                            program (by July 1, 1957) almost half of the agreed total of these
                            surplus commodities will have been delivered. This is proving especially
                            beneficial to India in that the sales of foodgrains to the public help
                            to counter inflation by absorbing the extra income generated by India’s
                            development projects.</p>
                        <p>In matters affecting commercial relations, the promotion of American
                            investment in India should be given priority, followed by trade
                            promotion. Financial difficulties and inflationary pressures have
                            created serious problems for India in the execution of its Second
                            Five-year Plan. Part of the answer could lie in foreign investment
                            whether in the form of direct capital participation or technical
                            licensing agreements.</p>
                        <p>Greater provision should be made for assisting American business
                            interests to enter the Indian market. Strong economic and commercial
                            ties between India and the Unites States will not only contribute to
                            India’s economic well-being and thereby keep it among the free world
                            countries but would also directly benefit U.S. business interests.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Communist Government in Kerala</hi>. The Communist
                            Party won its most significant electoral victory in India in March 1957,
                            when, in India’s second general elections, it gained control of the
                            Legislative Assembly of the State of Kerala. Communist Party members
                            were elected to 60 of the 127 seats in the Assembly. Having been joined
                            by 5 “independent” fellow-travellers elected with Communist support, the
                            Communist Party holds a slim majority upon which it hopes to consolidate
                            its newly-won position.</p>
                        <p>This victory of the Communists within a democratic, Constitutional
                            framework gives them an important foothold from which to expand in

                            parliamentary political party which may have a far-reaching effect on
                            their future capabilities. Their victory also introduces a new element
                            in the psychological battle for Asia which is clearly advantageous to
                            international Communism.</p>

                            on the issue of collective security, Pakistan’s being officially much
                            closer to that of the United States. In this context the main United
                            States problems are to prevent the outbreak of hostilities and to
                            maintain friendly relations with both countries while not weakening in

                        <p>The principal Indo-Pakistan dispute relates to Kashmir State and revolves

                            Kashmir has been a part of India since October 1947. Pakistan disputes
                            this contention and has the implied support of the <gloss

                            overriding interest of the United States in the dispute is to facilitate
                            a mutually-acceptable settlement. The manner in which it is achieved is
                            of considerable yet secondary interest. In the absence of a direct
                            agreement between the two parties, the United States must, and does,
                            fully support the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action to achieve a

                            amount of military assistance of major proportions. A considerable
                            amount of this aid has already been delivered, and some will continue to
                            be delivered for years to come. In the context of strained Indo-Pakistan
                            relations and of our desire to maintain friendly relations with India as
                            well as Pakistan, it is particularly important that the United States

                            Nevertheless India had signed a military sale agreement with the United

                            India’s requests under this agreement have presented no problem from
                            either the viewpoint of our national disclosure policy (for safeguarding

                            preventing an undue imbalance of power on the subcontinent. Such
                            requests should normally be met. Those few cases where Indian requests
                            raise disclosure problems should continue to be handled, as in the past,

                            for military supplies. To date India has not purchased such supplies
                            from the bloc, and this is one encouraging factor in U.S.-Indian

                            report described the economic difficulties arising out of India’s
                            expanded development program and particularly the anticipated shortages
                            of foreign exchange resources to carry forward the second Five-Year Plan
                            (1956–61) on schedule.</p>
                        <p>A part of the difficulties are caused by expanded private investment
                            activity, which has turned out to be greater than expected. A sharp
                            reduction in the Indian development program would doubtless have a
                            depressing and lasting effect upon the private sector in India. <pb
                                n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0382"/>The report estimated that the
                            foreign exchange gap for the Plan period, after taking into account
                            assistance from all available sources, including an assumed $300 million
                            of development and technical assistance from the United States under the
                            Mutual Security Program and an assumed $400 million from the
                            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, would total
                            $700–900 million.</p>
                        <p>More recently the Government of India has taken additional steps to
                            adjust to the serious situation which is developing. For example, it is
                            revising its tax structure to raise additional revenues, and by delaying
                            the initiation of new projects not yet underway, it is in process of
                            rephasing its development program to conserve foreign exchange
                            resources. Whether the Government of India further reduces the scale of
                            its development activity will be significantly affected by its judgment
                            as to the likelihood of further United States assistance.</p>
                        <p>Consistent with the policy directives of the National Security Council,
                            the United States should assist the Government of India at this time in
                            every practicable way, without however engaging its prestige in the Plan
                            objectives. It does not appear that United States aid resources of the
                            magnitude which the Indians believe necessary to carry out the Plan are
                            available at this time. The Department of State believes however that
                            the following measures constitute a feasible course of action within
                            present budgetary limitations for the United States to assist India in

                                required to carry out the Plan, as that gap was estimated in the May

                                which cannot otherwise be financed. The Indians heretofore had
                                estimated a continuation of United States Mutual Security Program
                                Developmental and Technical Assistance at a rate of $60 million a
                                year. In the future, with the establishment of the Development Loan
                                Fund, India in all likelihood will have to rely on this Fund for all
                                Mutual Security Program aid other than technical assistance. If
                                Indian project submissions prove sound and well documented,
                                development financing from the Fund might well run at a somewhat
                                higher rate than from present Mutual Security programs.</item>

                        <p>Although the Communist authorities in Kerala are, for tactical reasons,
                            currently pursuing a moderate policy towards American activities in the
                            State, there is no reason to believe that this policy will not change
                            when the Communists determine it politically advantageous to do so. They
                            may eventually demand the removal from their State of <gloss

                            activities in these fields cease. Unless the Government of India is
                            willing to oppose such moves by the Communists, the United States should
                            be prepared to withdraw <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> operations from Kerala. For the
                            present, however, no change should be made by the United States in the
                            level of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> activities in that State,
                            thus avoiding any situation which would benefit the Communists, by

                            to claim that they succeeded in obtaining more technical assistance than
                            did previous State administrations. By the same token, <gloss

                            anti-Communist propaganda has been increased to a marked degree.</p>

                                    <item>Travel and Conduct in Kerala: It is a basic policy
                                        objective of the Communist Party of India to use every
                                        available opportunity to subvert the United States position
                                        in India. The current policy of moderation and friendliness
                                        of the Communists in Kerala towards official U.S. personnel
                                        stationed in or visiting the area is obviously designed
                                        further to establish their respectability. Contact with U.S.
                                        officials provides the Communists in Kerala with a most
                                        valuable tool to further this objective. Following a further
                                        consolidation of their position or a change in policy
                                        towards the Government of India, the Communist authorities
                                        in Kerala may well adopt a policy towards U.S. personnel
                                        involving Communist-inspired altercations between U.S.
                                        citizens and the people of Kerala, and charges of U.S.
                                        subversive activities in Kerala and interference in internal
                                        affairs. The United States must avoid taking any action
                                        which (1) contributes to the Communist effort to gain
                                        respectability, or (2) might render the U.S. vulnerable to
                                        future Communist maneuvers against U.S. personnel in the
                                        area. The following sections are designed to meet this

                                    related to the same subject. In the first instance
                                    Krishnamachari met with various people including <persName

                                    discussed India’s plight with <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"

                                        >Dillon</persName> suggested that if India encouraged
                                    private investment then it would generate additional investment
                                    and stimulate a more positive attitude toward India on the part
                                    of the U.S. business community. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>

                                        >Herter</persName> stated that Congressional attitudes might
                                    be controlling and pointed to the unfortunate emphasis in the
                                    U.S. press on the differences between India and the United
                                    States. He did promise a sympathetic consideration of India’s
                                    problems within the limits of what realistically was available.
                                    Krishnamachari confessed that it was “difficulty” and
                                    “embarrassing” to have to raise the issues he had, but that was
                                    the principal reason he had come to the United States. (<hi

                        <p>The Finance Minister inquired when the President might be returning to
                            Washington since he hoped that he would have the privilege of seeing
                            him. The Secretary indicated that the President hoped that he would not
                            have to come back until the end of his vacation, which the Secretary
                            explained would not be for several weeks. The Secretary certainly
                            sympathized with the President’s wishes to have as complete a rest as
                            possible. However, the Secretary added, if the President should come
                            back before the end of his vacation, the Secretary would inform
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGL1">Mehta</persName>.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Krishnamachari stated that it was the Secretary’s recent press

                                    >Dulles</persName> stated:<p>“We have known for some time that
                                    there was a developing gap in the foreign exchange aspects of
                                    the second five-year plan. This has been giving concern in India
                                    and it gives concern to all of us who want to see that plan
                                    succeed. Now, there has been no formulation of any request from
                                    India. When it is made it will receive sympathetic
                                    consideration. Of course, we have some financial problems of our

                                n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0396"/>presume to have talks here on
                            that subject although Mr. Krishnamachari explained that he did not know
                            how far the Secretary’s press statement might indicate it appropriate
                            for him to proceed. The Secretary recalled his statement to the effect
                            that, if the Government of India presented a request for assistance, it
                            would be sympathetically considered. He stressed, however, that he had
                            also indicated that the United States also faced certain financial
                            problems. For instance, although the Executive had asked the Congress to
                            appropriate $500,000,000 for the new development loan fund in fiscal
                            year 1958 and to authorize an additional $750,000,000 for fiscal year
                            1959 and a similar amount for fiscal year 1960, the Congress had only
                            appropriated $300,000,000 for the current fiscal year and had only
                            authorized a total of $625,000,000 for next year. The Department did not
                            know when Congress might be willing to appropriate the remainder of the
                            authorized total. In addition, the Secretary said that he understood
                            that the Secretary of the Treasury had already pointed out to Mr.
                            Krishnamachari some of the financial difficulties facing the United
                            States Government such as current inflationary pressures, high interest
                            rates, mounting claims against the dollar, and the legal debt limit.
                            Indeed, if the British withdrew the entire $500,000,000 recently made
                            available to them, it would bring us right up to the ceiling.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary, however, would be very glad to have the views of the
                            Government of India regarding its general situation, its needs and the
                            minimum amount to carry through its Second Five Year Plan.</p>

                        <p>The Finance Minister then referred to several facets of India’s economic

                                    the most important problem remained that of financing “normal”
                                    imports. Unless additional funds could be made available, raw
                                    material imports might have to be cut by forty to fifty per cent
                                    and this would cause the private sector to suffer. Indeed, he
                                    had explained to the President of the Export-Import Bank that
                                    loans to private enterprise, which the Government of India would
                                    very much welcome, would cause increased demands for raw
                                    materials.</item>

                                <item>The private sector in India had increased very rapidly during
                                    the first year and a half of the Second Five Year Plan. The
                                    sector <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0397"/>required
                                    $100,000,000 to cover its outstanding commitments in foreign
                                    exchange and with another $100,000,000 would be able to complete
                                    its physical targets. Power projects, however, which were basic
                                    to continued expansion of the private sector, had had to be cut
                                    out of the Plan. This meant that further expansion of the
                                    private sector naturally would be limited. For the longer term
                                    expansion of this sector it was absolutely necessary to improve
                                    railroads and other transportation facilities.</item>

                                <item>In its planning India kept constantly in mind its capacity to
                                    repay obligations incurred. Its present debt, in relation to its
                                    resources, was certainly not large, thanks to the liquidation of
                                    the British debt which it was able to effect during the war
                                    years. India was also attempting to phase its debt commitments
                                    so that the servicing of them would reach its peak only ten
                                    years hence. Payments would then be spaced out for fifteen years
                                    after that period.</item>

                                <item>In conclusion, Mr. Krishnamachari indicated that if India

                                    seventy-five per cent of capacity. Actually, what India needed
                                    to fill its foreign exchange gap was $1,400,000,000. It did not
                                    expect to be able to obtain all this from the United States, but
                                    anything would be helpful.</item>

                        <p>The Indian Finance Minister then returned to the question of American
                            assistance. It has been said, he noted, that hitherto India has never
                            asked for aid from anyone. “Now, I can make a formal request.” The
                            Secretary interjected that this should only be done if the Minister knew
                            in advance that the request could be favorably acted upon. Nevertheless,
                            the Secretary continued, we can explore the possibilities without
                            waiting for such an assessment. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGL1"
                                >Mehta</persName> at this point noted that he had talked with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> several months ago and
                            that the latter had counseled him to wait in raising <pb n="376"
                                xml:id="pg_376" facs="0398"/>the question of American assistance for
                            India until the Congress had completed action on the then pending Mutual
                            Security legislation.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing inappropriate, the Secretary replied, in raising the
                            question informally at this time, for this is the time when we should be
                            considering what we are in a position to request from Congress. From a
                            political stand-point, the Secretary continued, there was no objection
                            to aid to India, for the United States would like to help India carry
                            forward its plan. Although the two governments might differ in their
                            approaches to several matters, it was important for India to demonstrate
                            economic progress under freedom and democracy. Indeed, the United States
                            believed that it had already been helpful in this respect. The Finance
                            Minister agreed with the latter statement and expressed his country’s
                            sincere appreciation for such American assistance.</p>
                        <p>In respect to India’s basic economic aspirations, the Secretary noted,
                            India and the United States are in agreement. We both want to see the
                            living standards of the Indian people raised and the country’s
                            industrial base developed. To the extent that this has been accomplished
                            in Communist countries, it has been only through the use of forced labor
                            and the denial of individual freedom. The pyramids, the Coliseum, and
                            other monuments are witnesses to similar use of slave labor in the
                            past.</p>
                        <p>We are, the Secretary warned, up against some hard facts, however,
                            because in the United States as in India we too have a democratic
                            society. There is growing opposition among the American people to our
                            Government’s assumption of additional commitments accompanied by a
                            growing demand for a reduction in taxes in order to ease the existing
                            inflationary pressures. The Secretary believed that this situation had
                            been reviewed for Mr. Krishnamachari at some length by the Secretary of
                            the Treasury. This, said the Secretary of State, is what he had in mind
                            in his press conference statement to the effect that we too had our
                            financial problems. Indeed, the Secretary did not think that it would be
                            possible for the United States Government to be able to provide sums of
                            the order of magnitude suggested by the Indian representative. We will,
                            however, be discussing among ourselves if, when, and how to go to the
                            Congress for help to India. The Secretary felt dubious at the moment if
                            the Executive Branch could gain the necessary support. He was also
                            uncertain what the Treasury and the Bureau of the Budget might do even
                            if the State Department decided that the matter should be taken up with
                            the Congress.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded that we would like to find ways to be helpful.
                            The United States’ interest in India’s economic development took
                            precedence over differences existing between the two countries.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary was interested to know that Mr. Krishnamachari was going to
                            New York to see what could be done to enlist the support of American
                            private finance. The Finance Minister explained that he would face some
                            difficulties because, always in the past having relied upon British
                            sources for needed capital, India had never cultivated foreign markets.
                            It is the normal state of affairs in the United States, the Secretary
                            explained, for private sources to make loans, noting the great progress
                            that such loans had enabled Canada and Venezuela to make.</p>
                        <p>The Indian Finance Minister entirely agreed, but noted that in Canada at
                            least there was some fear that American investment might have gone too
                            far. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName>, he continued, had
                            made some helpful remarks during the Finance Minister’s talk with him on
                            the role of private enterprise in economic development. In India the
                            Government itself had gotten over its original fears, born from its
                            colonial period, of foreign investment. Now it was unfortunately Indian
                            private businessmen themselves who were afraid of foreign competition
                            within India. Indian business was not unaware that foreign concerns
                            enjoyed a preferred position with the average Indian investor.</p>

                                facs="0400"/>stressed India’s economic needs and the interest of the
                            United States in helping that country overcome them. During this period
                            the United States Government has responded by a loan of $190,000,000 to
                            purchase wheat, by technical assistance grants in the amount of $56.8
                            million, by economic development loans and grants (in last three years
                            mostly loans) in the amount of $342.9 million, and by a $360,000,000 PL
                            480 program (with a very small grant element). During this entire
                            period, however, the Government of India has scrupulously refrained from
                            formally requesting assistance. Indeed, in the case of the 1950–51 wheat
                            deal, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> himself insisted
                            on its being in the form of a loan repayable in dollars, rather than as
                            a grant.</p>

                            sent their Finance Minister to Washington to seek substantial assistance
                            in the form of a long-term loan, repayable in dollars from the United
                            States.</p>

                        <p>A third basic decision still remains to be taken. It is whether, and if
                            the decision is in the affirmative, in what amount and in what forms the

                            This will presumably require further consideration of the whole problem
                            by the Secretary and eventually by the President himself. It will
                            require weighing the financial and other practicable difficulties
                            mentioned by the Secretary against the advantages to the United States
                            which might reasonably be anticipated to flow from assistance to India
                            and, conversely, against the disadvantages to the United States which
                            might be expected to occur if no assistance were forthcoming.</p>

                        <p>To assist in making the difficult evaluation suggested above it might be
                            helpful to restate the arguments for and against aid to India.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Fundamental argument for assistance</hi>. This is
                            simply that no American wants to see the Communists take over India and
                            that, if assistance given in time and in the right amount can
                            substantially contribute to forestalling this, it would be a reasonable
                            investment from the point of view of the national security of the United
                            States. Once a country, like China, comes under Communist control it is
                            lost to the free world; no amount of dollars can buy it back.</p>
                        <p>That there is danger of the Communists assuming control in India seems
                            clear from the fact that the Communists doubled their popular vote from
                            five percent in the 1951–52 elections to ten percent in the 1957
                            elections, that in the most economically depressed state of Kerala they
                            secured a working majority and are now in control of its Government,
                            that in Calcutta City—harassed with <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380"

                            elected two of the four members of Parliament from Calcutta and ten of
                            the twelve Calcutta members of the West Bengal Assembly, and that the
                            Communists are right now playing up economic grievances of the Calcutta
                            citizens so successfully that they can and do paralyze life in that
                            important city whenever it is to their interest to do so. It does not
                            seem too gloomy to forecast a Communist victory or at least a Communist
                            access to power in the populous province of Bengal in the 1961 elections
                            if economic progress is slowed down, instead of speeded up, between now
                            and then.</p>
                        <p>Nor does any American want to see India disintegrate through the play of
                            divisive forces based on ethnic, lingual, or religious differences. Yet
                            these lie very close to the surface in India (which only under British
                            rule was ever truly a single political unit) and could erupt if
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>, his Government, and
                            the Congress Party lost the respect of the Indian masses. One way for
                            this to be almost assured would be for <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> to prove himself incapable of fulfilling the
                            minimum economic aspirations of these masses. A large scale scrapping of
                            the second Five Year Plan, such as would be unavoidable in the absence
                            of increased external financing, would be taken as dramatic proof of
                            this incapacity.</p>
                        <p>Thus the basic argument for aid is that, if the Free World as a whole
                            (for not only the United States is involved) wants to keep India’s 380
                            million people, its considerable iron and coal resources, and its
                            strategic communications position out of the Soviet orbit, realizing
                            also that if India went so would go almost all of Asia, the Free World
                            must do its best to help the present Government of India do its best.
                            This best may not be very high in our eyes, but it must hold out some
                            prospect of improvement to politically active elements in India. It must
                            also be at least equal to China’s economic development into which it is
                            reported that the Soviets are committed to investing something like the
                            equivalent of $2 billion.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Fundamental difficulties involving assistance</hi>. It
                            is evident that available sources of US aid cannot provide the sums
                            needed by India in the time required. If India’s request is to be met,
                            special Congressional authorization would appear to be necessary since
                            no combination of Mutual Security assistance, Export-Import Bank loans,
                            PL 480 programs or other US available resources can provide funds
                            adequate to permit India to proceed confidently on her minimum program.
                            There is, on the other hand, strong public and official pressure to
                            reduce Government expenditures.</p>
                        <p>It is already abundantly clear that Pakistan will react adversely to any

                            Government will not wish to have Pakistan or any other government
                            dictate how the US should handle its relations with a <pb n="381"

                            have to be taken into account. Perhaps as the situation develops
                            assistance to India might be broadened to include presently projected

                            necessary to consider India’s needs on their own merits. After we decide
                            whether it is in our interest to meet these needs, we can consider how
                            this decision could most usefully be presented and exploited to achieve
                            our other goals in the subcontinent.</p>
                        <p>One might, as a lender, wish to make certain of the borrower’s long-term
                            ability to repay his obligations and still accomplish the objectives for
                            which the debt is being incurred. This raises the question of whether
                            India’s population growth is so great that the country can never hope to
                            expand its economy rapidly enough to keep ahead of it, i.e., to assure
                            an increasing per capita standard of living. Perhaps all that one can
                            say is that some economists believe that this is possible provided India
                            receives on credit enough capital to permit her to break what has been
                            called the “economic sound barrier”. This barrier, representing the rate
                            of capital accumulation, faces all underdeveloped countries before they
                            reach the point where capital accumulation from internal resources can
                            be sufficient to assure ever upward-spiraling industrial output.
                            Apparently the World Bank has enough confidence that this is possible in
                            India to be prepared to invest quite a few hundreds of millions of
                            dollars of its lenders? money in helping India crash the barrier.</p>
                        <p>The question has at times been raised of what may happen to India, and by
                            implication to United States interests in India, when <persName

                        <p>In short, our final decision would appear to hinge on the evaluation as
                            to whether the free world can take the risk of letting India sink or
                            swim on its own, with the limited aid that is now contemplated from both
                            the US and other free world sources.</p>
                        <p>Those who make this decision must weigh the risks of this course against

                        <p>They may also wish to consider whether, if the decision is to provide
                            increased aid, the United States and the free world will not receive the

                            <p>The report by an interdepartmental study group entitled “The Economic
                                Problems of India”,<note n="4" xml:id="d176fn4">See <ref

                                together with recommendations for action submitted by the Department
                                of State, was discussed by the Operations Coordinating Board on July
                                26, 1957, and referred to the Working Group on South Asia on July
                                30, 1957, for review and development of recommendations in order
                                that an agreed position can be developed prior to the visit to the
                                United States of the Indian Finance Minister the last week of
                                September.</p>
                            <p>The problem as outlined and analyzed in the report remains
                                essentially the same.</p>
                            <p>India’s development effort is going forward vigorously. The private
                                business sector especially has shown unexpected expansionist
                                activity. India’s total effort, however, requires more resources
                                than India has or is currently obtaining from foreign sources.</p>
                            <p>Since the report was prepared, therefore, the Indian foreign exchange
                                situation has deteriorated even further. On August 13, the Minister
                                of Finance announced that the minimum foreign exchange reserve
                                requirement of the Reserve Bank was lowered from $840 to $630
                                million, as permitted by law, and it is anticipated that additional
                                action will have to be taken shortly either to reduce or abolish the
                                minimum reserve requirement. Inflationary pressures also continued
                                and wholesale prices rose nearly two percent in July. Action taken
                                by the Government of India to deal with the problem has included
                                revision of its tax structure to raise additional revenues and
                                concerted efforts to cut down on less essential imports and expand
                                exports.</p>
                            <p>The estimate in the report is that the gap between foreign exchange
                                requirements of the Second Five Year Plan and foreign exchange
                                availabilities, after taking into account foreseeable assistance
                                from all available sources, would total $700–$900 million for the
                                entire period of the Plan (i.e., through March 1961). The <gloss
                                    target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> Staff has also made an estimate
                                of the <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> uncovered foreign exchange
                                requirement for the next two years alone, based only on the needs of
                                the “hard core” projects on which the Indian Government <pb n="385"
                                    xml:id="pg_385" facs="0407"/>is now planning to concentrate.
                                This estimate comes to $3–$500 million. Substantial additional
                                foreign aid, over and above that which can now be projected, appears
                                to be necessary if India is to salvage the “hard core” of the Second
                                Five Year Plan.</p>
                            <p>Any additional reduction in the Indian development program would
                                result in a slower rate of economic expansion and presumably less
                                relief to the Indian unemployment situation. A sharp reduction in
                                the development program would result in a loss of the momentum that
                                has been gained in both the public and private sectors. A failure to
                                achieve a rate of economic development acceptable to the Indian
                                people would tend to weaken moderate elements in India and increase
                                the chances that extremist elements would eventually come to
                                power.</p>
                            <p>It is in U.S. interest that India should substantially achieve the
                                broad aims of the Five-Year Plan in terms of increases in output and
                                employment, and should continue to make an effective assault upon
                                its development problems. The U.S. should not, of course, engage its
                                prestige in the success of the program. The U.S. should be prepared
                                to consider sound loans, PL 480 arrangements, and other measures
                                sufficient to give substantial help in achievement of the broad aims
                                of the Plan, including the private investment necessary for its
                                realization.</p>

                            <p>Although United States aid resources of the magnitude which the
                                Indians believe necessary to carry out the Plan are not available at

                                course of action within present budgetary limitations. It is
                                recognized however that the following recommendations will not cover
                                India’s projected requirements and that the Indian economic problem
                                should be kept under continual review by the U.S. Government.</p>

                                    million a year. In the future, with the establishment of the
                                    Development Loan Fund, India in all likelihood will have to rely

                                    is unlikely to be at a higher rate than in the past, in view of

                        <p>Following an exchange of greetings, the President recalled with pleasure
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>‘s visit of
                            last year, during the course of which the two had had an opportunity of
                            discussing at length the Indian development program. He asked the
                            Finance Minister whether he had been encouraged with respect to the
                            possibilities of private investment helping in the development program.
                            Mr. Krishnamachari said that the private banking institutions of course
                            were not prepared to make loans to India, but that there was some
                            interest in investment by industrial firms, although not nearly as much
                            as he had hoped. He said that India had opened a very large sector to
                            private enterprise. The State must do a great deal itself, but private
                            enterprise would have a substantial role to play in the Indian system. A
                            problem was, of course, that the shortage of foreign exchange affected
                            private enterprise as well as State operations.</p>
                        <p>The President commented generally on the Indian economic requirements,
                            stating that the United States was sincerely interested in helping. The
                            Minister would realize, of course, that the United States had taken on
                            substantial burdens in the last few years and we had many problems of
                            our own, such as the pressure of inflation, tight money, etc. He was
                            pleased that during his meetings in Washington the Minister had been
                            able to get to the State Department and other agencies information which
                            could be used by the United States Government to evaluate the situation,
                            and which might contribute to the preparation of recommendations to the
                            Congress. The President commented upon the problem of persuading the
                            public and the Congress that it was in our national interest to help
                            other nations with their economic problems. The Minister could be sure,
                            the President said, that the aspirations of India were supported by the
                            Administration, but what we would be able to do would depend in large
                            measure upon Congress. We were impressed <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388"
                                facs="0410"/>with India’s first five-year Plan. The President hoped
                            that the Indians would press forward with the second Plan, and would not
                            become discouraged. He observed that for people who kept working, things
                            seemed to work out. He recalled examples in the past where situations
                            for the free world seemed dark and gloomy, but with hard work they soon
                            improved.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said he was deeply touched with the kindness and courtesy he
                            had received in Washington. He was particularly grateful to the
                                Secretary.<note n="2" xml:id="d177fn2">H.M. Patel told <persName

                                was appreciative of the courtesy he had encountered, but was
                                compelled to conclude that no U.S. funds were immediately available
                                to India from existing resources. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                    >Dillon</persName> assured him that the matter would continue to
                                receive high priority attention. (Memorandum of conversation by
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BFP1">Bartlett</persName>; Department of
                                State, Central Files, 891.00/10–957)</note></p>
                        <p>The President said he felt that he had a substantial understanding of the
                            Indian problem, and had constantly pleaded for an understanding on the
                            part of others. Unlike the United States which gained its independence
                            at a time when it had vast untouched natural resources, India began with
                            a very substantial population with very strained resources. Obviously
                            the problems for India under these circumstances were infinitely greater
                            than those which the United States faced in the early period of its own
                            development. In considering United States cooperation with India, the
                            question often arose as to political differences. While there were
                            differences in our approach to international problems, the United States
                            was cognizant of India’s high moral standards, that the Indian
                            Government differentiated clearly between right and wrong, and that
                            India would be unwilling to give up its independence. The Minister
                            commented that our differences in international questions were really
                            not fundamental. India had special problems, as did the United States.
                            India, for example, could well understand “Little Rock”<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d177fn3">On September 24, President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> nationalized the
                                Arkansas National Guard and sent Federal troops to the city in
                                response to a crisis stemming from the desegregation of Little Rock
                                schools.</note> since India itself had an extremely difficult
                            problem in “human relations”. The important thing was that both
                            countries were trying to work out these problems.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said he thought one difficulty with which India might be
                            confronted with respect to the question of aid was that its request came
                            at the “tail end” of a 12 year period when the United States extended
                            aid in generous quantities. He could understand the reluctance of the
                            American people to continue this program indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>The President said that perhaps we were toward the end of a phase in our
                            aid program, but he thought it should be considered <pb n="389"
                                xml:id="pg_389" facs="0411"/>only as a phase. The American people
                            would realize that it was in their own national interest to help others.
                            He felt that the Indian success was not purely a national affair for
                            India, but that it would affect the whole free world. Friendly nations
                            must find better ways of working together and of perfecting means for
                            defending their way of life.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Krishnamachari observed that he was going to West Germany before
                            returning to India. He commented upon the tremendous progress in Germany
                            which had been facilitated by American aid.</p>
                        <p>He remarked, jokingly, that in some respects he wished the United States
                            had occupied India in 1947. The results of the German occupation seemed
                            to have enabled Germany to make an impressive economic recovery and
                            expansion. The President observed that Germany should be able to help
                            India and wondered if Mr. Krishnamachari would discuss this with the
                            Germans. The Minister replied affirmatively, but did not appear to be
                            greatly optimistic that Germany would be able to do much.</p>
                        <p>The President and the Minister discussed generally the question of Indian
                            economic potentialities. The Minister mentioned particularly that the
                            Indian production of steel would reach 5 million tons per annum after
                            the present plans are implemented, which will provide enough steel for
                            India’s internal needs with perhaps some for export. He said the very
                            great deposits of high grade ore in India and other favorable factors
                            would render it possible for India to produce steel at one of the lowest
                            costs in the world.</p>
                        <p>In a general discussion of Indo-Pakistan relations, Mr. Krishnamachari
                            emphasized his hope that the Kashmir question would not be permitted to
                            come to a head. He observed that no one in Pakistan was strong enough to
                            assume responsibility for a decision on Kashmir, and that if Kashmir
                            should be lost to India the Congress party would fall from power. His
                            hope had been that India and Pakistan would be able to solve this
                            problem so that they could work together on a broad basis. India should
                            be able to cooperate with Pakistan in common defense, customs, etc.
                            Politics, however, had rendered this impossible in the past. The
                            Minister mentioned Indian concern over arms to Pakistan, which had
                            required India to divert substantial amounts of money to its own
                            defensive requirements in the light of Pakistan’s increased capability
                            and in circumstances where it seemed that Pakistan’s intentions were
                            hostile to India.</p>
                        <p>The Minister asked again whether it would be possible for the President
                            to visit India. The President said he would sincerely like to visit
                            India, but his problem was that he had not been able to think of a way
                            to do this without necessitating a trip to many other countries which
                            had invited him. He had talked to the Secretary about this problem on
                            several occasions, as recently as last week. In <pb n="390"
                                xml:id="pg_390" facs="0412"/>the ensuing discussion the President
                            mentioned the possibility of his brother visiting India.<note n="4"

                        <p>I believe that it is desirable to reach an Executive Branch decision
                            concerning aid to India in the near future because of the impact of such
                            a decision on budgetary planning and mutual security Congressional
                            consultations. It would be helpful if a decision could be made before
                            November 13 when I am to submit final official budget estimates to Mr.

                        <p>I enclose a brief memorandum which has been prepared in the Department
                            setting forth our view that substantially increased aid should be
                            provided India during the next three years. This proposal has already
                            been discussed informally with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                                >Anderson</persName> and the Vice President, and we will make this
                            memorandum available to them prior to the proposed meeting on this
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>If an Executive Branch decision to provide India with such aid could be
                            reached in principle, we could then give more detailed consideration to
                            the method and timing of this aid and consult with interested allied
                            governments concerning the proposed aid.</p>
                        <p>I recommend, therefore, that you meet with the Vice President, the
                            Secretary of the Treasury, and myself in the near future to reach an
                            Executive Branch decision, in principle, concerning aid to India.<note

                                <item>India has embarked on an effective economic development
                                    program, reflected in the Second Five Year Plan. The private
                                    business sector is responding with unexpected vigor.</item>

                                <item>There is a gap of somewhat over $1 billion between the foreign
                                    exchange required to complete even a reduced Second Five Year
                                    Plan and the foreign exchange which will probably be available
                                    to India during the next three years from all other sources,
                                    including foreign exchange drawdowns, the World Bank, other
                                    developed countries, private investors, and PL 480. Further
                                    study of the Indian economic situation is unlikely to alter this
                                    basic conclusion, which has been reached independently by the
                                    United States Embassy in New Delhi, the World Bank
                                    representative in India, and the Department of State. If
                                    anything, this estimate of the gap is believed by these sources
                                    to be overly conservative.</item>

                                    Plan would hasten the disintegration of the Congress Party and
                                    threaten the continuance of democratic government. There is now
                                    no other coherent opposition force except the Communists, and
                                    they would stand to make important political gains from the
                                    collapse of the Congress Party. Success with the Plan would
                                    probably permit the Congress Party to retain power in the 1962
                                    elections and would provide the kind of environment in which a
                                    moderate conservative party could emerge when and if the present
                                    Congress Party breaks up.”</item>

                                <item>This estimate is emphatically endorsed by the Department of
                                    State and by the United States Embassy in New Delhi. In the last
                                    elections, the Communists came to power in the economically
                                    depressed Indian state of Kerala. It is feared that if the
                                    second Five Year Plan fails they may extend their power to the
                                    more populous and strategically situated province of Bengal.
                                    This could trigger off a chain reaction which would lead to
                                    growing extremism and separatism in other parts of the country.
                                    The chances of chaos and a Communist advent to power in the
                                    sub-continent would be vastly increased. Loss of this area to
                                    Communist control would undermine the West’s position throughout
                                    free Asia.</item>

                                <item>This is the risk that the United States would run in not

                                    outside sources, the Government of India will have to reduce its
                                    imports to such an austerity level that the momentum for
                                    economic development will be lost and the second Five Year Plan
                                    will fall considerably short of its goals.</item>

                                <item>These considerations led the National Security Council to
                                    decide in January that it was in the United States interest that
                                    India be able substantially to fulfill the second Five Year
                                    Plan, and that the United States be prepared to extend
                                    substantial assistance to this end.<note n="4" xml:id="d179fn4"

                                <item>If this policy is to be carried out, substantially increased
                                    United States aid will be required. That aid must be adequate to
                                    meet our objectives, if it is not to be wasted. To increase our
                                    aid to India somewhat, but not enough to meet the basic need,
                                    would be to choose the worst of the several alternatives
                                    confronting us.</item>
                                <label>8.</label>
                                <item>It is concluded that it would be in the United States interest
                                    to provide India with somewhere around $250 million annually in
                                    assistance over the period of the second Five Year Plan, i.e.,
                                    the next three fiscal years, over and above the approximate $100
                                    million annually which can probably be secured from the
                                    Development Loan Fund. There are various alternative means of
                                    providing this additional $250 million annually, each of which
                                    would have the same effect on the <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                        >FY</gloss> 1959 budget and all of which would require
                                    approval by this or the next session of the Congress. A choice
                                    between these different methods need not, therefore, precede a
                                    decision in principle concerning increased aid to India. This
                                    choice can be made, on the basis of more detailed consideration
                                    of the alternatives, once that decision has been reached.</item>
                                <label>9.</label>
                                <item>Once a decision in principle has been reached, it will also be
                                    desirable to undertake careful discussions with the governments
                                    of Pakistan, Turkey, and Iran. If necessary, of course, our
                                    decision could be reviewed in the light of those
                                    discussions.</item>

                        <p>The basic assumption upon which the study rests is that it is to the
                            interest of the United States that India maintain its independence and
                            its free institutions and achieve its long-range goals of internal
                            development. This thesis needs no emphasis here, beyond the general
                            statement that India is and can continue to be a great force for
                            stability in Asia, perhaps in the whole world. It will, indeed, some day
                            have to be the Free World defense in South Asia against Communist
                            Chinese imperialism, if Free World interests are to be safeguarded in
                            Asia. If properly led, and developed internally, it can undoubtedly play
                            this role. Conversely, failure in this regard will have wide
                            repercussions, adverse to United States and Free World interests.</p>

                                        probably increase the chances of Congressional approval.
                                        (This fact, incidentally, would not be lost on the Indian
                                        Government as it considered how to respond to our approach

                                    (i) initially this assistance would take the form of project
                                    loans from the Development Loan Fund and perhaps of a

                                    of providing this assistance, e.g., a request of the Congress
                                    for special legislation, might also be considered; (iii)
                                    whatever means of assistance were to be employed, they could not
                                    be exploited to the full without full Congressional support.
                                    Agreement to the settlement should not be a prerequisite to
                                    United States aid, since it will be in the United States’

                                    more favorable if there were some prospect of improved relations
                                    between India and Pakistan, and this could be frankly pointed
                                    out.” (Department of State, Central Files, 690D.91/11–657)</p>

                                        >Rountree</persName> suggested that the initial approach
                                    might be in the form of an informal call by the respective
                                    Ambassadors upon the Prime Minister of each nation. They would
                                    carry a Presidential letter stating that the United States, as a
                                    friend of both nations, wished to volunteer its services in
                                    solving the problem. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
                                        >Rountree</persName> noted that both Ambassadors <persName

                                    urged the Secretary to develop a negotiating plan to serve as
                                    the foundation of discussions between the Ambassadors and the
                                    Prime Ministers. Since a moratorium on the arms race was a key

                            writing you personally because I understand that the question of the
                            nature and the amount of the assistance to be extended to India will be
                            shortly before you for consideration and decision. I do this only
                            because I think the matter is of the utmost importance.</p>
                        <p>I have attempted to appraise the situation here as objectively as
                            possible, and I believe that we have come to a moment in history when it
                            is within our power significantly to influence the choice that a great
                            part of the world’s population will make between the democratic and
                            totalitarian way of life. If through adequate long term credits India
                            can be reasonably assured of a rate of economic progress under
                            democratic institutions which will, in part at least, meet the
                            expectations of her people, I think her choice of such democratic
                            institutions will be vindicated and that her continuance as a stable
                            democratic country will follow. I believe also that if this takes place
                            in India the rest of uncommitted Asia will follow her example. I am
                            satisfied that India is a good risk and that the money will come back to
                            us with interest.</p>
                        <p>It is not often that such an opportunity is presented to a nation. If we
                            meet it courageously and generously, I am sure that we and future
                            generations will be greatly rewarded. We have only to consider what our
                            failure to act decisively and in time in the case of China has cost us
                            in treasure and in lives, and what we would be willing to spend to
                            reverse the process there, to find the answer to what we ought to do in
                            India. We differ with India, of course, on many points of foreign
                            policy, but it seems to me that these are not significant when viewed in
                            the context of our overall objectives and our grand strategy in this
                            part of the world.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said the main purpose
                            of the meeting was to discuss the question of a loan to India. He
                            suggested Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>
                            might outline the Indian finance situation. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that India has put a levy
                            on capital of the order of 10% in some areas. The result is to scare off
                            private investment even though some of their private people, such as
                            Birla when he was here, make a great deal of sense in their plans and
                            propositions. He said India is talking about a $1.4 billion deficit over
                            the next three years. If we were to provide that kind of money we would
                            have to go to Congress for a <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0427"
                            />specific loan. Aid to India will be a very hard proposition to sell,
                            because their behavior has been very offensive on the Communist issue,
                            and because they have gone out of their way to insult us on many
                            occasions. Any special program for an individual country, and
                            particularly for India, might have a bad effect on the whole
                            Congressional effort. He said that Gaillard<note n="2" xml:id="d183fn2"
                                >Félix Gaillard, Premier of France.</note> and the government of
                            France are in deep trouble, and the requirements for aid are
                            substantial.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if Germany could not lend the Indians some money.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said the Germans
                            have shown some disposition to do something like this, and their
                            attitude is rather encouraging. He suggested the President talk to
                            Adenauer about this at the Paris meetings.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that the proposal
                            for a loan to India has implications all across the map. The impact on
                            Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan will be great—they will be deeply offended if
                            we give major aid to India while they are so much in need, when they
                            have been supporting us while India has been working against us.<note

                                specifically Pakistan, if India turned to the Soviet Union for
                                assistance. He stated that no final decision had been made on the
                                aid question and termed any probable assistance relatively modest.

                            Indian military program is quite extravagant. They are buying Canberra
                            bombers from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, saying they must do
                            so because we are providing bombers to Pakistan. (This is untrue, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said, and he said he
                            had so informed Bevan,<note n="4" xml:id="d183fn4">Aneurin Bevan,
                                British Labour Party leader and Member of Parliament.</note> who had
                            indicated <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> had told him just
                            the opposite.) Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> went on to say that India
                            has a very bad internal situation—the Communists are gaining power in
                            several of the provinces, and this scares off private funds. He did not
                            consider it likely that the Soviets would give massive loans to India.
                            What is likely to happen is disintegration with the Communists taking
                            over a piece at a time. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                                >Anderson</persName> said that if we gave the Indians the loan they
                            are seeking, we would simply be covering their trade deficit with
                            Germany and their purchase of bombers from Britain. He agreed that we
                            should talk with the Germans about their trade balance with India. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> recalled our efforts to shift the Indian
                            bomber program from Russia to Britain, and said that he felt the Soviets
                            would pick up the bomber program if Britain dropped it. India wants
                            bombers, not because Pakistan has them, but because Pakistan has none,
                            and they can thus threaten Pakistan.</p>

                        <p>The Vice President asked what a program might be that would not require
                            special legislation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                            thought it might be possible to prevail on the <gloss target="#t_EXIM1"
                                >Ex-Im</gloss> Bank for a bigger loan than they now plan, and it
                            could be a balance of payments loan for purchases in the United States
                            for the private sector. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                                >Anderson</persName> said that if we carried on aid to India at our
                            current level, gave them $200 million from the <gloss target="#t_EXIM1"
                                >Ex-Im</gloss> Bank, and they drew down their reserves and got some
                            aid from outside, perhaps Germany, they could squeak through. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> recalled that we had
                            given them grain under PL 480 for a three-year period, and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> brought out that they had used
                            this up in twenty-one months.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President surmised that if we were to do this, Turkey and
                            Pakistan would immediately be in for aid. If we do not, the cost will be
                            disintegration of India and its orientation toward the Communists. He
                            said that if we do not work out something in this matter, the propaganda
                            effect of such disintegration would be very heavy and adverse throughout
                            Asia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, in commenting on any
                            idea of special legislation, said that the danger of a spectacular
                            defeat in Congress is very great. He thought it was better to pick up
                            bits and pieces, slow down the military program, and get the <gloss
                                target="#t_EXIM1">Ex-Im</gloss> Bank to put up additional funds. The
                            President said he would be glad to meet with the people concerned at the
                            NATO session in Paris.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> summarized the outcome
                            of the meeting as follows: We will not go to Congress for a special
                            grant; we will try to break the problem down into parts; we will try to
                            get the Germans to cover the Indian trade deficit with them; we will try
                            to cover our deficit through the <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">Ex-Im</gloss>
                            Bank, perhaps $200 million, we will try to provide $50 million or so
                            from the development fund; we will talk with them about the bomber
                            question; and we will talk with them about their internal condition
                            which impedes the flow of private funds. The President confirmed this,
                            and said that we should discuss with the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> what we are doing.</p>

                        <p>The meeting was arranged at the request of the Indian Ambassador who had
                            only returned to Washington on December 19. The Ambassador opened the
                            conversation by inquiring about recent developments in connection with
                            United States economic assistance to India.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> explained that the
                            Executive Branch was continuing to consider the general problem and that
                            the Export-Import Bank was making a particularly intensive study of it.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had seen Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> yesterday. The latter had told
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> that he hoped to be in
                            a position to talk with the Indian representatives about mid-January.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> understood that the
                            Government of India had a group of experts who might be available to
                            discuss the matter in Washington and believed that the Executive Branch
                            might be ready to receive them about January 13. The discussions would
                            involve developing a coordinated approach to India’s needs not only with
                            the Export-Import Bank and the Development Loan Fund, but also with the
                                <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGL1">Mehta</persName> then outlined
                            briefly the sequence of newspaper stories that had appeared in the
                            Indian press while he was in that country, concluding that there was
                            real concern in his country over the prospects of assistance from the
                            United States and that he hoped we would be able to say something
                            officially and publicly in the near future. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied that we might perhaps be
                            able to say something to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> prior to the arrival of the Indian experts, but
                            that this would require careful preparation, particularly in view of the
                            fact that the Export-Import Bank, an independent agency of the United
                            States Government, was of course involved.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGL1">Mehta</persName> asked whether
                            thought had been given to seeking a special appropriation from the
                            Congress. In reply Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                            explained that certain Congressional leaders had been consulted <pb
                                n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0430"/>and that, although there were
                            differences of opinion among them, on balance the Executive Branch had
                            decided that it might be best to attempt to cover India’s needs for this
                            year from existing resources. This did not mean, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> continued, that we could not go
                            to Congress next year. For several internal reasons it was believed that
                            the general atmosphere might be better for Congressional consideration
                            next year. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGL1">Mehta</persName>
                            stated that he understood that every Government must, of course,
                            consider its own domestic political situation, pointing out that in
                            India certain political groups in opposition to the Congress Party were
                            criticizing the Indian Finance Minister for having come back from
                            Washington “empty-handed”. This group, which included the Indian
                            communists, would be only too happy to have American aid to India not
                                materialize.<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2"><persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
                                    >Rountree</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_MGL1"
                                    >Mehta</persName> on December 30 that disagreements between the
                                United States and India on a number of questions complicated the
                                problem of a request to Congress to enact special aid legislation
                                for India. (Memorandum of conversation by <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName>; <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>After again assuring Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGL1"
                                >Mehta</persName> that we would consider trying to get a message to
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> prior to the arrival of
                            the Indian experts, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                            stressed that it would be most important for the Indians to come
                            prepared to discuss the commodities which India might be able to buy in
                            the United States during the next fifteen months or so. He noted that
                            this might require some changes in timing of contemplated future
                            purchases in order to utilize all the funds within this period of time.
                            Whether the Export-Import Bank’s contemplated assistance could be termed
                            a “line of credit” was to some extent a question of wording. The
                            Export-Import Bank, of course, was not anxious to set a precedent which
                            could be seized upon by other countries, so that a method might have to
                            be worked out whereby funds would be made available for lists of
                            industries, for railroads, for highways, etc.</p>
                        <p>In reply to direct questions, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> explained that the Executive Branch was thinking
                            in terms of Export-Import Bank loans of between 150 and 200 million
                            dollars and projects under the Development Loan Fund which might total
                            between 50 to 75 million dollars. The amount of Export-Import Bank
                            loans, however, would depend upon whether India could suggest enough
                            commodities to absorb the amounts contemplated. This, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted, was a question for
                            negotiation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> also
                            confirmed that the Executive Branch would be talking to Congressmen
                            about the conversion of India’s Wheat Loan repayments from a dollar to a
                            local currency basis. He didn’t expect any real difficulty, however, for
                            the Executive Branch had the authority to do this. However, this was one
                                <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0431"/>reason why the Executive
                            Branch believed it might be better to postpone going to the Congress for
                            a separate appropriation for India during this session. Any assistance
                            under P.L. 480, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                            concluded, would be in addition to assistance from the sources
                            previously mentioned.</p>
                        <p>In connection with India’s foodgrain needs, the Indian Ambassador
                            confirmed that India would receive about 7 million dollars worth of
                            wheat from Canada under the Colombo Plan and was now negotiating with
                            Canada for commercial purchases of 100 million dollars worth of wheat
                            with payments deferred for five years. The Ambassador also stressed
                            worldwide shortage of rice. He stated that in India riceless days were
                            being instituted and that the Prime Minister was setting the example of
                            cutting down on rice consumption by not including any rice dishes in his
                            own menus.</p>
                        <p>Replying to a query whether he had talked with representatives of any
                            other government regarding India’s economic needs while he was in Paris,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> indicated that United
                            States representatives had discussed this question with the Germans. The
                            Ambassador then noted that the Indians were also talking to the Japanese
                            about it and that both India and Japan were now seriously pushing the
                            Orissa iron ore project. He also noted that Mr. K.B. Lall, a very senior
                            official in the Indian Ministry of Commerce, would be coming to the
                            United States to discuss possibilities of barter arrangements under PL.
                            480 and of expanding tea and jute sales in the United States. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that he was
                            extremely pleased to hear of these developments.<note n="3"

                            thing we would have to straighten out was the matter of the red tape
                            hampering our military aid program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHS1"

                            been in the U.S. some months back, we had given him certain assurances
                            and had sent him on his way back feeling fine. But when the Admiral saw
                            him in Pakistan two months later, there was a hassle over how the money
                            was to be made available.<note n="3" xml:id="d185fn3">These discussions
                                between <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> and

                                implementation of the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement between
                                the United States and Pakistan, which had been signed at Karachi on
                                May 19, 1954, and entered into force on that same date. It
                                stipulated that the United States would provide military aid and
                                training to the Pakistani armed forces. The text of the agreement is
                                in 5 UST 852.<p>Under the terms of an aide-mémoire given to the
                                    General on October 21, 1954, the United States agreed to meet
                                    deficiencies in the Pakistani Armed Forces by providing (a)
                                    screened equipment requirements for 5½ divisions of the Army;
                                    (b) 12 vessels including 6 destroyers and 6 minesweepers for the

                            counterpart funds to be used for direct military aid, or were they to be
                            used for economic aid? What proportion was to go to each? All this added
                            up to delay and confusion. The Pakistanis were bewildered and wanted to
                            know what was the matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> interjected that the

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> noted that the main
                            problem was the lack of competent staff for <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                                >FOA</gloss>, but that progress was being made along this line. He
                            added that Mr. <persName>Jack Bell</persName> was soon to go out there
                            as Chief of the <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> Mission, and that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJO1">Bell</persName> was very well qualified.
                            Replying to the Admiral’s inquiry, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1"
                                >Jernegan</persName> said that the present incumbent was
                                leaving.<note n="5" xml:id="d185fn5">Ralph R. Will.</note> The new

                            be expected to improve the situation.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName>
                            said, there was a lot of trouble over legislative provisions: troubles
                            with the program involving the use of surplus agricultural products as a
                            means of contributing aid; and limitations on the manner of granting
                            aid. As many as six different agencies, Commerce, State, Treasury,
                                <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>, Budget and Defense were
                            involved.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that the
                            point was that the President would tell some foreign official that they
                            could have 30 or 40 million dollars, and that then there was general
                            confusion as to how to implement the program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed to difficulties
                            on this score with respect to Yugoslavia and the promise of 250 tons of
                            wheat to that country.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that there
                            were three countries where he thought this problem was most acute;
                            Turkey, Thailand and Pakistan. If we are going to hedge our offers, he
                            said, we should make that clear from the very start to the foreign
                            officials concerned. Just before he left Pakistan, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said, instructions
                            were received by the Embassy regarding the use of counterpart funds
                            which was not what the Pakistanis wanted. All this, he emphasized, <pb
                                n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0434"/>was not doing us any good, and
                            only caused us to lose any good will we might have gained by instituting
                            the program in the first place.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> agreed. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that this was a

                                Ali</persName> in Karachi, but hardly saw him, since the
                            Governor-General was in bed.<note n="8" xml:id="d185fn8">
                                <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Mohammed Ali</persName> was the Prime
                                Minister of Pakistan; Ghulam Mohammed was the

                            and might drop off at any time. If he does go, there was certain to be a
                            struggle for power within the country. <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1"
                                >General Mirza</persName>, the Admiral understood, was the No. 2
                            strong man, but in the Admiral’s opinion the best man was <persName

                                corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> said that he did not know
                                <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">General Mirza</persName>, but that the
                            specialists in the Department think that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName>, who definitely expects to be
                            Prime Minister one day, is more competent than <persName
                                corresp="#p_AKGM1">General Ayub</persName>. The Admiral said that
                            that very well might be, but as far as honesty and directness is
                            concerned, <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> was no match
                            for <persName corresp="#p_AKGM1">Ayub</persName>. Further discussion
                            prompted the Admiral to recount that during the recent government crisis
                            in Pakistan involving Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Mohammed
                                Ali</persName>, the Governor-General was prepared to name <persName
                                corresp="#p_AKGM1">Ayub</persName> as Prime Minister, but that it
                            was <persName corresp="#p_AKGM1">Ayub</persName> himself who persuaded
                            the Governor-General to keep <persName corresp="#p_ACM1">Ali</persName>.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> said that, as a
                            matter of fact, both Generals <persName corresp="#p_AKGM1"
                                >Ayub</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName>
                            had persuaded the Governor-General to keep <persName corresp="#p_ACM1"

                        <p>Commenting further, <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral

                        <p>The Admiral emphasized that Pakistan was a potential ally of great
                            importance, and that meanwhile from the military point of view, they
                            have a trained armed force which no other friendly power can match, not
                            even the Turks.</p>

                            Jilani.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked if <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> discussed recent Pakistan military maneuvers with
                            anyone while the Admiral was in Karachi. The Admiral replied that he
                            heard of the maneuvers and that they were successful; that he thought
                            Brigadier General <persName corresp="#p_SBGWF1">Sexton</persName>,
                                <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, had attended; but that he had
                            not discussed this subject as such with anyone. The Admiral explained
                            that his time in Karachi was short and that most of the talks were with
                            the American Ambassador and his staff, US-<gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> personnel and Pakistan officials concerning mutual
                            problems and understanding, mainly in the area of U.S. assistance
                            programs. The Ambassador then wanted to know if the various
                            ramifications of the assistance programs were found in order and if, on
                            the U.S. side, we had made up our minds as to the details of the
                            program. He said that Pakistan had now signed both agreements under our
                            Laws PL 665<note n="2" xml:id="d186fn2">The Mutual Security Act of 1954,

                            latter was signed yesterday, 17 January. He said that he was very happy
                            that Pakistan was the first country to sign both agreements; especially
                            so, since it was sometimes difficult for the people not acquainted with
                            our legal processes, to intelligently comprehend the “ins and outs” of
                            the working mechanisms. The Ambassador also wanted to know if we, the
                            U.S., had settled on the military assistance program as a whole.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> then scanned
                            a paper before him which was a brief of Pakistan military assistance
                            program situation as of now, and then informed the Ambassador that this
                            year’s program seemed to be well in hand and well on the road to
                            complete resolution. The Admiral informed the Ambassador that the U.S.
                            did have a complete program <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0436"/>of
                            military assistance for Pakistan and that we were working from that
                            program; that the present information was available both to Pakistan
                            officials and U.S. officials in Pakistan. The Admiral explained that
                            this complete program was not necessarily the final version since
                            desirable changes as time went by might be suggested by either the U.S.
                            or Pakistan and would, of course, be adopted if agreed to by both.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then brought up the subject of completion of a Pakistan
                            Armory (arms and/or ammunition factory). He wondered if this subject had
                            been discussed; and in particular in the light of possible U.S.
                            assistance in this regard if this Armory seemed advisable. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that the subject
                            had been mentioned while he was in Karachi; that no military discussions
                            were held; that he understood a Survey Team was to go to Pakistan
                            shortly to look into this matter and report; this matter was being
                            considered but no decisions had been made. The Ambassador and the
                            Attaché both confirmed their understanding that a U.S. Team was shortly
                            to look into this matter.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said that he understood from the newspapers at the
                            time of <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s visit
                            to Karachi, that <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>
                            had made statements to the Press to the effect that Pakistan had a most
                            important part to play in <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>.<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d186fn4">Pakistan was an original member of the

                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> explained that
                            he really did not remember making such a statement; that his only
                            contact with the Press was for a very short period at the airport upon
                            arrival; that if he did make such a statement in substance, it no doubt
                            was in reply to questions asked by newsmen and not an “off the cuff”
                            declaration of Pakistan’s importance to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss>. The Admiral said that often his answers to questions
                            appear out of context and that for example, immediately after his return
                            to Washington he was quoted widely in the newspapers as having again
                            advocated a blockade of Communist China. The fact of the matter was that
                            he made no such comment or recommendation. The Ambassador smiled and
                            said, yes, he understood how things were twisted from time to time.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> then
                            explained that it had been gratifying to see Pakistan sign the <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Pact and that, of course, her
                            membership was important to all.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then gave a brief of his ideas concerning <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. He said that apparently there were
                            two schools of thought as to security against Communist encroachment.
                            First, there were those peoples and countries who tended to accept the
                            Communist word and who avoided defensive measures and mutual security
                                <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0437"/>arrangements since they
                            believed or feared such actions would antagonize the Communists. These
                            people might eventually feel it better to join than to resist. Then, on
                            the other hand, there were those people and countries like Pakistan, who
                            believe in appropriate defensive measures and believe and hope for sound
                            mutual security arrangements. The Ambassador expressed concern that
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, so far, had not provided
                            definitive security arrangements. He thought that <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, so far, lacked strength in that
                            there had been no clear cut agreements as to when action would be taken;
                            how it would and could be taken; and to what extent <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> members would be supported by the
                            rest of the Free World. He seemed to think there was danger in words
                            without conviction and in security arrangements which did not clearly
                            indicate a will to resist if need be. He said that the U.S. and the Free
                            World were well organized and in sound condition in Europe and, through
                            recent arrangements in the Middle East, in that locality also. However,
                            he pointed out that we, the U.S. and the rest of the Free World, were in
                            very bad shape in Southeast Asia and the Far East. He was firmly

                                >Admiral Radford</persName> was silent for a moment, and then
                            explained that whereas he understood the Ambassador’s concern, the
                            Admiral felt that the problems stated by the Ambassador were properly
                            problems on the political and diplomatic levels and that the military
                            were only advisers. The Admiral stated that the military problems were
                            relatively simple when compared to political, diplomatic, and economic
                            problems. In the military area we could always see what it would take
                            and how a job would have to be done. It was true that the execution of
                            the military decisions might involve many complex problems, but in that
                            area we pretty well knew what could and could not be done and how.
                            Militarily speaking, we had built up strength around the world; that
                            strength was still growing; the use of that strength is something else
                            again. The Admiral concluded that he too hoped the Bangkok meetings of
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> would be fruitful.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said he had fears concerning the Asia-Afro
                            conferences and he pointed out that Burma seemed to be drifting toward
                            Communism. In particular, he said that at one time he had thought the
                            Prime Minister of Burma<note n="6" xml:id="d186fn6">U Nu.</note> would
                            eventually <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0438"/>come around and join
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, whereas now it seemed
                            fairly clear that the Prime Minister and Burma were drifting toward the
                            Communists. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>
                            said, yes, that he too had hoped Burma would join <gloss

                        <p>The Ambassador expressed his appreciation for the conference, said his
                            “goodbye’s” and departed.</p>

                                telegram 921, January 8, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HHA1"
                                    >Hildreth</persName> offered some general comments regarding the
                                question of using Pakistani counterpart funds generated under Public
                                Laws 480 and 665 for military purposes. He complained that
                                Washington, although it had no greater information than the country
                                team and was at some remove from the problem, “should consider
                                itself in position to settle issues of Pakistan military counterpart
                                requirements once and for all by making allocation of funds part of
                                aid agreements now ready for signature.” The Ambassador emphasized
                                that there was obviously no disagreement between the country team
                                and Washington on the central point that the heart of the U.S.
                                problem in Pakistan was how to coordinate the military program with
                                economic development so that “we end up with military establishment
                                useful United States objectives this area and substantially within
                                ability of Pakistanis to support.” He also pointed out that a
                                “squeeze play” might be shaping up, whereby the Pakistanis would
                                endeavor to secure the maximum possible commitment of counterpart
                                funds for economic development and then produce a large additional
                                bill for military requirements as a commitment which the United
                                States was bound to honor. Accordingly, <persName corresp="#p_HHA1"
                                    >Hildreth</persName> recommended that the Pakistanis be reminded
                                that the funds generated by the U.S. economic aid programs
                                represented the total U.S. contribution to Pakistan for the fiscal
                                year and that there was no possibility of finding any additional
                                funds to cover military requirements. (<hi rend="italic"

                                Secret. <persName corresp="#p_HHS1">Hensel</persName> was in
                                Pakistan as part of a tour of several Asian and Middle Eastern
                                nations. The trip, which lasted from February 6 to March 10, was
                                undertaken in order to assess the defense needs of the countries
                                visited and evaluate U.S. military aid programs. A handwritten

                                equipment was coming into Pakistan just about as rapidly as Pakistan
                                could absorb it and, therefore, did not feel that there was any real
                                resentment on the part of the Pakistani over our slowness in
                                carrying out our promised programs.</item>

                            <item>The major problem being encountered by the Country Team was the
                                division of money between economic aid on the one hand and direct
                                forces support and defense support on the other hand. General
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SBGWF1">Sexton</persName> felt that the
                                Pakistani needed increased pay to its officers and men, better
                                subsistence and better housing and he was constantly struggling for
                                such aid against suggestions the money should be spent for
                                additional irrigation which the country obviously needs badly. The
                                members of the Country Team felt that the conflict between these
                                types of expenditures had not been adequately resolved at the
                                Washington level and that they had no real <pb n="419"
                                    xml:id="pg_419" facs="0441"/>guidelines as to the relative
                                importance of increased military strength and increased economic
                                capability to decide the priority of such claims on our aid.</item>

                            <item>There is no doubt that Pakistan needs direct forces support. I
                                have seen military encampments where the men are living in tattered
                                and torn tents which compare very unfavorably with some of the
                                ramshackle huts built, particularly in the Middle East, by the
                                various Arab and Pakistani refugees. Furthermore, I am advised that
                                practically the entire Pakistan Army is under canvas of that type.
                                On the other hand, the country needs irrigation very badly. Most of
                                the land is barren desert with a few green spots very conspicuous
                                because of their infrequency. This was very noticeable in the flight
                                from Iran to Karachi and from Karachi to Peshawar.</item>

                            <item>It was perfectly obvious that no member of the Country Team had
                                any clear idea of the part Pakistan was expected to play in the
                                defense of the Middle East or whether that role would be developed
                                into an important one. There was continual reference to the fact
                                that <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> favored
                                increased military strength in Pakistan, but no one seemed to know
                                precisely why except that Pakistani obviously make reliable fighting
                                soldiers. At the same time, it seems quite clear that Pakistan
                                regards the Indian threat as much more serious to Pakistan than the
                                Russian or Communist China threats. The Pakistani Army is now
                                deployed along the Indian border and all tactical and strategic
                                planning by the Pakistani center on Indian problems as having first
                                priority. If Pakistan is to be expected to supply forces for
                                fighting outside its borders, it seems probable that Pakistan will
                                not regard itself as having any excess until it has at least four,
                                and more probably five, fully equipped and well trained divisions.
                                Furthermore, if Pakistan is expected to supply troops outside its
                                borders, someone will have to provide the necessary transportation
                                and logistical support. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that such
                                transportation and support could be provided within time to permit
                                the Pakistani to participate in the defense of the Zagros mountain
                                passes. If it is thought that Pakistan can contribute to the defense
                                of Southeast Asia, it should be remembered that practically all of
                                the military strength of Pakistan is concentrated in West Pakistan
                                and that the transportation of forces from West Pakistan into
                                Southeast Asia would require a trip around the entire country of
                                India and back up into the Southeast Asia territory.</item>

                                developed which will outline the military role expected of Pakistan
                                and permit us all to move in that direction.</item>

                                        Document 185</ref>.</note> Such aide-mémoire mentions (and
                                commits the U.S. to) a program of $171 million over three years and
                                promises to use the United States’ best efforts to accelerate that
                                program. This is one of the rare—if not the only—instance in which
                                we have disclosed to a recipient country the precise amount in
                                dollars of our programmed aid. While I think this disclosure was a
                                mistake and I have not yet been able to discover the theory in aid
                                of which the disclosure was made. I am afraid the commitment to
                                Pakistan is rather firm and cannot be modified in time or amount
                                without causing dissatisfaction. Nevertheless, in view of such
                                commitments, we must face rather squarely the amount of money we
                                intend to provide for Pakistani aid during fiscal year 1956 and make
                                such amount known to Congress.</item>

                                    corresp="#p_HHA1">Hildreth</persName> recapitulated the main
                                elements of Pakistan’s present constitutional crisis which began in
                                September 1954 when the Pakistani Constituent Assembly passed a bill
                                designed to curtail the powers of the Governor-General. Ghulam
                                Mohammed then proclaimed a state of emergency, dismissing the
                                Constituent Assembly. A Pakistani Federal Court was subsequently
                                empowered to decide whether Ghulam Mohammed’s action was legal.
                                Regardless of the decision made by the court, the Embassy was
                                convinced that the present government would take whatever action was
                                necessary in order to confirm its hold on power. In concluding this
                                lengthy analysis of the crisis, the Ambassador offered the following
                                    assessment:<p>“In sum, Embassy convinced of following points: 1)
                                    Present regime has will and strength to stay in power,
                                    regardless outcome of Federal Court decisions; 2) promulgation
                                    of new constitution desirable, in any event, and will probably
                                    occur regardless of court decision; 3) precarious state Governor
                                    General’s health makes early action to clarify succession
                                    imperative; 4) desirable for Pakistan and United States stake in
                                    Pakistan that regime maintain itself by methods which have at
                                    least appearance of legitimacy, and that new constitution be
                                    adopted by method which does not set Pakistan off too sharply
                                    from community of democratic nations; 5) this last condition can
                                    be most effectively met if government secures favorable decision
                                    from court; difficulties in event of unfavorable decision such
                                    that if government warned in advance, it might be justified in
                                    forestalling action by promulgating constitution at once.” (<hi

                                reported that the Commonwealth Relations Office was satisfied that

                            <item>After more than two years of recurrent crises, political power in
                                Pakistan has been openly assumed by a small group of British-trained
                                administrators and military leaders centering around
                                Governor-General Ghulam Mohammed and his two principal associates,
                                Generals <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Iskander Mirza</persName> and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AKGM1">Ayub Khan</persName>. The regime
                                favors a strong central government, economic development through
                                austerity measures and foreign aid, and close alignment with the US.

                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>We believe that the present regime will remain in power at least
                                through 1955 and probably considerably longer. Its firm control of
                                the armed forces will almost certainly enable it to discourage or if
                                need be defeat any attempt to challenge it, and it is unlikely to
                                allow itself to be ousted by political maneuvering or legal
                                challenges to its authority. Although East Pakistani provincialism
                                will continue to pose serious problems, we do not believe that
                                separatism will become a major threat. (Paras. 15, 22, 28)</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>At least for several years, however, the regime will probably be
                                handicapped by a lack of organized political and popular support and
                                even more by the thinness of its top leadership. Moreover, within
                                the ruling group there are differences of view which could <pb
                                    n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0446"/>become serious. The death
                                of the ailing Ghulam Mohammed—which might come at any time—would
                                probably not lead to the fall of the regime, but it would severely
                                test the ability of <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName>
                                and <persName corresp="#p_AKGM1">Ayub</persName> to keep their
                                associates in line and their opponents under control, and might
                                compel them to rely more openly on the armed forces. Should

                                    corresp="#p_AKGM1">Ayub</persName> in turn be removed from the
                                scene, a many-sided struggle would probably follow. This might give
                                rise to another, basically similar, authoritarian regime or it might
                                result in serious internal disorganization and perhaps a weakening
                                of Pakistan’s present alignment with the US. (Paras. 16, 23–26,

                                only 1,500–3,000, poses little threat to the government. (Para.

                            <item>Presently programmed US economic assistance will alleviate
                                Pakistan’s immediate economic difficulties. In time, given
                                substantial foreign aid and a settlement of the canal dispute with
                                India, Pakistan has fairly good prospects of increasing agricultural
                                production, and possibly of achieving self-sufficiency in the
                                important field of textiles. At best however, Pakistan is unlikely
                                to do much more than keep its head above water and will probably be
                                a recurrent petitioner for economic assistance for a number of
                                years. Cessation of US aid during this period would necessitate
                                substantial readjustments in economic policy, probably including
                                reductions in development and defense expenditures. (Paras.

                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Under the present or any similar regime, Pakistan will almost
                                certainly continue to cultivate close ties with the US, if only
                                because of Pakistan’s urgent need for US economic assistance and its
                                desire for US military and diplomatic support to strengthen its
                                position against India. Pakistan’s present regime will probably
                                cooperate with US efforts in the further development of
                                anti-Communist defense arrangements in both the Middle East and
                                Southeast Asia. It is not likely, however, to commit any more than
                                token forces outside Pakistan territory unless its armed forces are
                                considerably strengthened, its economy improved, and its fear of
                                India greatly reduced. In the event of a general war, Pakistan would
                                recognize that its interest and obligations lay with the West, but
                                unless directly threatened, it would probably seek specific Western
                                protection before overtly departing from nonbelligerence. (Paras.
                                40–41, 43, 53)</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>Although a settlement of the Kashmir dispute remains highly
                                improbable, Pakistan’s relations with India are unlikely to worsen
                                critically under the present regime. In fact, prospects are
                                reasonably good for an eventual settlement of the canal waters
                                dispute and various lesser controversies. Even if present tensions
                                abate, however, Pakistani-Indian relations will be marred for many
                                years by underlying animosities. (Paras. 44–45)</item>

                            <item>Pakistan has strained its economic resources to build up its
                                military capabilities, primarily for defense against India. However,
                                these capabilities are seriously limited by logistical shortcomings
                                and by deficiencies in equipment and technological skills which
                                would require a long-sustained and costly effort to overcome. We
                                believe that the present leadership would be favorably inclined
                                toward US peacetime development of air bases for US use, but actual
                                agreement to such development, and the extent of the rights which
                                Pakistan would give the US for use of bases, in peace or war, might
                                depend on the regime’s current assessment of Indian, Soviet and
                                domestic political reactions, and the extent of US aid and
                                guarantees Pakistan might expect to receive. (Paras. 48,

                        <p>In conference with the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary yesterday,
                            Wednesday, March 30, among several subjects covered, the Prime Minister
                            raised the question of military aid, saying apparently his people and
                            mine were at loggerheads over the number of men the United States would
                            support and the size of divisions. I replied, “yes” that was so, and
                            quickly reviewed with complete frankness the talks General <persName
                                corresp="#p_SBGWF1">Sexton</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BBGR1"
                                >General Brown</persName> and I had with <persName

                            recently, and also the conversation <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426"
                                facs="0448"/>I had had with <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1"

                            covered in despatch no. 608<note n="2" xml:id="d191fn2">In despatch 608,
                                March 31, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HHA1">Hildreth</persName>
                                reported that <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AKGM1">Ayub</persName> had informed him
                                that they did not want any support for military aid to come out of
                                economic funds or counterpart funds because that only made the rest
                                of Pakistan angry at the proportion of funds the military was
                                receiving. The Ambassador countered that there was no money to
                                accomplish what had already been agreed upon as desirable objectives
                                unless the United States used counterpart funds. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HHA1">Hildreth</persName> told <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AKGM1">Ayub</persName> that the Department believed
                                he was “trying to squeeze too hard” and that if he did not settle on
                                a program at the present time, he would be risking the cooperation
                                that he had received up to date. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>

                            despatch.</p>
                        <p>In summary, I told them that there was disagreement and I expected there
                            would be more of them, but I had told <persName corresp="#p_AKGM1"
                                >Ayub</persName> and I was telling them that I thought it was time
                            we stopped chasing our tails and somebody made some firm decisions as to
                            a limit on both manpower and dollars and how much of the dollars would
                            be diverted from economic aid through using counterpart funds to achieve
                            the military goal. Admittedly, <persName corresp="#p_AKGM1"
                                >Ayub</persName> would probably be disappointed but in order to stop
                                <persName corresp="#p_AKGM1">Ayub</persName> and the Finance
                            Minister scrapping and in order to stop ourselves scrapping I was
                            advising our Defense Department to set a definite limitation in answer
                            to these questions. I told the Prime Minister that all that had been
                            promised him while he was in the States would be forthcoming, but it
                            might not achieve what <persName corresp="#p_AKGM1">Ayub</persName>
                            wanted, and, as the money was not available to achieve what <persName
                                corresp="#p_AKGM1">Ayub</persName> wanted, I thought it was in the
                            interests of both our countries to get on with what could be
                            accomplished instead of constantly holding up getting the program
                            started in the hopes that it could be expanded.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister, harassed with many other problems, seemed almost to
                            find relief in my decisiveness and indicated that he was no more
                            interested than I was in arguing with his military people about the size
                            of the division. He seemed resigned to the fact that if our military
                            people could not agree on the size of the divisions that Pakistan would
                            still get what was promised in the way of dollars, but would not come up
                            with as many divisions as <persName corresp="#p_AKGM1">Ayub</persName>
                            wanted if the size of the divisions were going to be as large as
                                <persName corresp="#p_AKGM1">Ayub</persName> wanted.</p>
                        <p>I then went on and commented that some of our people could not make sense
                            out of the Pakistan military requests for some things from the U.S.,
                            such as uniforms, which our people, particularly General <persName
                                corresp="#p_SBGWF1">Sexton</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BBGR1">General Brown</persName>, thought they could make
                            right here in Pakistan, thus saving the dollar exchange for things that
                            they could not make here. Furthermore, this policy, in addition to
                            saving dollar exchange, would give employment and better economic
                            conditions in Pakistan. The Prime Minister seemed to wholeheartedly
                            concur in this line of reasoning and I went on and commented that <pb
                                n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0449"/>we are not without some
                            suspicions that there was an inclination in some Pakistan military
                            circles to favor procurement of some stuff outside rather than making it
                            here because there was more chance for a rake-off. I was careful to say
                            we were not certain of this but, on the other hand, we were not free
                            from suspicions. I, furthermore, told him that our military people both
                            in Pakistan and in the U.S., from what I had seen in papers going over
                            my desk, felt that the Master General of Ordnance was very poorly
                            equipped to deal with his job.</p>
                        <p>All the above was reported to General <persName corresp="#p_SBGWF1"
                                >Sexton</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BBGR1">General
                                Brown</persName> a few minutes ago and they expressed great pleasure
                            and satisfaction that I had spoken as frankly as I had and on the
                            subjects I covered with the Prime Minister and emphatically stated their
                            belief that if the Master General of Ordnance was gotten out of the
                            picture it would save tremendous sums of money for both Pakistan and the
                            United States.</p>

                        <p>In response, <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, on June 25,
                            summarized the United States commitment to Pakistan under the program.
                            Of the total $34.2 million in military aid allocated to Pakistan for
                            fiscal year 1954, he explained, $7.9 million had been delivered as of
                            March 31, 1955, and the military departments expected to complete
                            delivery of the fiscal year 1954 program by December 1956. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> stated that under the present

                            allocation of military equipment, approved by the Secretary of Defense,
                            Pakistan was in the third priority. As a result, he noted, <pb n="430"
                                xml:id="pg_430" facs="0452"/>some delay in the delivery of certain
                            military equipment had been experienced. “The Pakistan government is
                            having economic difficulties in raising the additional troops required
                            to properly use all this equipment,” he added. “An increase in priority
                            which would result in an acceleration of deliveries would add to these
                            difficulties and would establish a requirement for increased economic
                            aid.” <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> thus concluded this
                            memorandum with the recommendation that deliveries to Pakistan be
                            continued at the scheduled rate and under priorities as presently

                                position,<note n="6" xml:id="d195fn6">On June 21, a new Pakistan
                                Constituent Assembly was elected.</note> with reasonable prospects
                            of retaining power, though this will certainly be diluted by need to
                            strike bargain with non-Muslim League elements and to broaden base of
                            Cabinet. Their position by no means as strong as it was, and any
                            vulnerabilities will be vigorously exploited by opposition.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, we consider obvious slow-down in delivery
                            schedule reported DA 983570, and protraction of total army program over
                            5 years or more as predicted <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> study
                            bound to have unfortunate consequences. It is too early yet to assess
                            long-term prospects following Assembly elections, but it seems entirely
                            possible that if these facts become generally known this might seriously
                            impair ability of group to influence Assembly. At the least it is
                            certain to be serious embarrassment to them and will probably
                            disillusion them with US. If they ride out opposition attacks and retain
                            control in spite of them, their disposition to cooperate with US will
                            probably diminish considerably.</p>
                        <p>These developments appear particularly untimely at juncture when
                                <persName corresp="#p_AKGM1">Ayub</persName> has just been persuaded

                                <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> referred to

                                    and asked for Defense’s comments. Mr. <persName

                                    military or internal security purposes’. He emphasized that
                                    Defense felt that we need to know what we are buying and what we
                                    are getting for our money; that in this case we will not be
                                    spending this money for purely military purposes and we should
                                    recognize it as such. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                                        >Hoover</persName> then remarked that while he had not been

                                    beginning, it had been his impression from his talks with people
                                    in Defense that the military felt that two countries in the
                                    Middle East were particularly well suited to military investment
                                    on the part of the United States. These two countries were
                                    Turkey and Pakistan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                                        >Anderson</persName> agreed entirely and said that in the

                                    absorbed for military purposes. The very time required for
                                    training soldiers to use this equipment prevented its effective
                                    use for military purposes at such a rapid rate. It was agreed to

                            interpretation of US approval may be placed on such actions. Conclusion,
                            in light our appraisal is that (1) we should encourage <persName

                            effective implementation of the <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss>
                            Program here is essential to the success of United States
                            politico-military objectives throughout the Middle East. These
                            considerations are important and I believe should be taken fully into
                            account. In my personal capacity as Ambassador to Pakistan I am even
                            more concerned, however, with the impact of the Program’s implementation
                            on the effectuation of our policy objectives within Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>I believe in this connection that the carefully considered opinions of

                            of the effects of elections to the Constituent Assembly on the position
                            of the pro-United States group which aligned Pakistan with the free
                            world have been borne out by events to date. This group remains in a
                            central position, but their effective power has been reduced. And they
                            are vulnerable to attack in the event the <gloss target="#t_MDA1"
                                >MDA</gloss> Program should fall appreciably short of
                            expectations.</p>
                        <p>These views are reinforced by consideration of the position in the new
                            Government of those most directly involved in the Washington
                            conversations of last October which defined the scope and timing of the
                                <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> Program. <persName

                        <p>These men have been among the most powerful friends of the United States
                            in Pakistan. I believe that their continuance in positions of power, and
                            their continued friendliness toward the United States are important to
                            our policy objectives here. I am deeply concerned with the effect on
                            their position and on their feeling toward the United States of the
                            indicated retardation and protraction of the <gloss target="#t_MDA1"

                        <p>I do not know the basis on which the funding arrangements and delivery
                            schedules reported by the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Chief
                            have been decided, nor the level on which they have been reviewed and
                            confirmed. I cannot believe, however, that these several items which
                            added together seem to amount to a repudiation of a written commitment
                                <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0459"/>entered into at the

                            objectives from the Middle East through Southeast Asia, which would
                            inevitably result from this apparent breach of faith should it become
                            known, I have on my responsibility requested the <gloss

                            concerning these developments from Pakistan Defense officials pending
                            the arrival of authoritative guidance from Washington. I now urge in the
                            strongest possible terms that the whole problem be reviewed in
                            Washington at a responsible level, with the object of bringing

                            he also “had certain knowledge” that Shah of Iran felt same way and so

                            strengthened by vigor with which some Army men still advocate settling

                        <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0469"/>
                        <p>I believe that none of us is anxious to see this program expanded beyond
                            the level necessary to meet our commitment nor to an extent which will
                            impose an undesirable burden on the Pakistan economy. On the other hand,
                            we have made, as you are aware, a written commitment to the Pakistanis,
                            which has as we see it three aspects: time, money and force goals. Your
                            letter recognizes the time and money aspects of the commitment but as I
                            understand it, the Defense Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have
                            not recognized that we were committed by the aide-mémoire to bring five
                            and a half divisions up to a strength near a level of combat
                            effectiveness. Accordingly, the Defense Department has thought of our
                            commitment to meet deficiencies as being defined in terms of the cost,
                            $171 million, of the material specified in the report of the Joint
                            Military Survey Team.</p>
                        <p>However, from Karachi’s telegram 499<note n="3" xml:id="d204fn3"><ref
                                    target="#d199">Document 199</ref>.</note> and from earlier
                            messages it appears that the Country Team and the Pakistanis also had
                            believed the deficiencies we were undertaking to fill were to the extent
                            of equipment needed to bring the five and a half divisions up to a level
                            of combat effectiveness rather than simply what had been specified in
                            the Survey Team Report. The Pakistani concept of the commitment was
                            originally much more extended than that of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss>, but I understand the latter has done a good deal to
                            reduce inflated Pakistani notions as to what these divisions required
                            and that it was eventually agreed between the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> and the Pakistani military that Pakistan’s divisions
                            should have tables of organization and equipment no greater than those
                            of United States divisions.</p>
                        <p>Since the receipt of Karachi’s telegram 499, the Country Team has
                            informed Pakistani leaders that the United States commitment was for
                            $171 million only. This view was received fairly understandingly by the
                            top non-military figures in the Government, but most unfavorably by
                                <persName corresp="#p_AKGM1">General Ayub</persName>,
                            Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army, who continues to have the
                            loyalty of the 150,000 man Army and who is an extremely powerful figure
                            in the country. In fact, he may be strong enough to bring about, if he
                            chooses, a general feeling of disappointment and frustration towards the
                            United States by asserting that we have failed to keep our promise to
                            Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>Should the Pakistanis become persuaded that the United States had not
                            kept its word, and certain political and journalistic elements <pb
                                n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0470"/>in the country are only too
                            ready to accept this view, we would have suffered a serious setback in
                            terms of our objectives for Middle East Defense and the political
                            stability of Pakistan. In view of the current Soviet efforts to increase
                            their influence in the Middle East, I think it is very important we do
                            everything we can to keep the confidence of countries like Iraq and
                            Pakistan which are committed to our side. In addition, Pakistan, as you
                            know, plays a significant part, through its membership in the Manila
                            Pact, in planning for Southeast Asia defense.</p>
                        <p>Karachi’s telegram 630<note n="4" xml:id="d204fn4"><ref target="#d201"
                                    >Document 201</ref>.</note> contains some suggestions by the
                            Country Team on what might be supplied to bring the Pakistani divisions
                            more nearly to a state of combat effectiveness. I understand this
                            problem will be further explored by a three-man team from the Department
                            of Defense now visiting Karachi. For the reasons mentioned above, I hope
                            the Department of Defense will give most careful consideration to
                            supplying some additions to the assistance program for the Pakistan
                            Army. However, replies to Karachi’s 499 and 630 should, I think, be
                            delayed until we have a clearer concept as to what the situation
                            requires. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HHA1">Hildreth</persName> is

                            Pakistan. It appears that the present dissatisfaction with our <gloss
                                target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> program in that country stems from the
                            adoption by the Pakistan Government of an interpretation of the October
                            1954 aide-mémoire which differs from the interpretation held by the
                            Department of Defense.</p>
                        <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0473"/>
                        <p>The aide-mémoire is subject to various interpretations, as the wording is
                            ambiguous. In one paragraph it states that the U.S. proposes a program
                            estimated at $171 million to be delivered over a three-to-four year
                            period and in another paragraph states “the present program is designed
                            to meet deficiencies in the Pakistan Army, Navy and Air Force as
                            follows,” then the force bases are listed.</p>
                        <p>The Pakistan Government interprets this aide-mémoire as committing the
                            U.S. Government to filling, in 3½ to 4 years, all of the equipment
                            deficiencies in the 5½ division Army portion of the Pakistan force bases
                            without regard to the $171 million figure mentioned in the aide-mémoire.
                            The Department of Defense interprets the aide-mémoire as committing the
                            U.S. Government to program and deliver $171 million worth of military
                            end items over a three-to-four year period and within funds made
                            available by the Congress and, consistent with the priority of
                            requirements upon the U.S., to continue to meet U.S. screened
                            deficiencies in the 5½ division force bases. The Department of Defense
                            now recognizes that the figure of $171 million was based on an initial
                            estimate and will not meet screened deficiencies in the Pakistan force
                            bases. The provision of additional equipment may be required in the
                            future to meet these screened deficiencies.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the problem of arriving at an accurate estimate of the
                            U.S. screened deficiencies for the Pakistan Army, there is presently
                            underway in the Department of the Army a study to determine the
                            feasibility of adopting tables of equipment for the Pakistan Army
                            commensurate with the probable mission and employment of these forces.
                            This problem is illustrated by the fact that only on 14 November was the
                            Chief of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Pakistan able to convince
                            the Pakistanis to reduce the size of their infantry division from about
                            25,000 to about 17,500, and the size of their armored division from
                            about 19,500 to 15,000. Until such a table of equipment is adopted for
                            Pakistani units, the dollar cost of supplying the remaining equipment
                            deficiencies cannot be determined.</p>
                        <p>Approximately $25 million of the initial $171 million remains to be
                            programmed in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957. As you are aware,
                            the Department of Defense presented on 18 November a proposed program
                            for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957, in a joint session with
                            State, <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, and the Bureau of the
                            Budget, which provided a total of approximately $108 million for
                            Pakistan. This program consisted of $65.4 million for equipment, $40.6
                            million for Direct Forces Support and $1.9 million for training, and is
                            in the context of a world-wide <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957
                                <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> program.</p>
                        <p>It would appear that final determination of actual programming for
                            delivery should await completion of action and review of the
                            “Interdepartmental Coordinated Survey of Pakistan” directed by the <pb
                                n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0474"/><gloss target="#t_OCB1"
                                >OCB</gloss> on 20 July 1955, in order that a realistic estimate of
                            Pakistan capabilities to support their forces in the long run can be
                            made. Otherwise, by providing assistance in excess of the amount that is
                            programmed in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 under the $171
                            million program, we may be increasing in 1957 the investment we will
                            have to protect, through maintenance, in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1958 and thereafter.</p>
                        <p>Future programs, and it is assumed that there will be a continuing
                            program after the completion of the current program of $171 million,
                            will further address themselves to the problem of equipping the approved
                            force bases in accordance with the tables of equipment now being
                            developed for the Pakistan Army.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AKGM1">Ayub Khan</persName> has accused us of not
                            keeping our word as implied in the 1954 aide-mémoire. It is unfortunate
                            that the initial estimate fell short of actual Pakistani needs, and that
                            there were two interpretations of this aide-mémoire. However, the
                            development of firm tables of equipment upon which to judge actual
                            Pakistani requirements for equipment and the additional assistance
                            planned for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 will combine to give
                            us a clear concept of what the deficiencies are and what remains to be
                            done to assure that our commitment to Pakistan will be met. Thus, we
                            will be in a position to assure <persName corresp="#p_AKGM1">Ayub
                                Khan</persName> that Americans can, in fact, be trusted. I agree

                            Navy programs at indicated levels will permit satisfactory progress.
                            Army program at $30 million will leave deficiencies in five and one half
                            divisions US committed to fill totaling more than $300 million.

                            one half years. In fact, program would never be completed, since
                            equipment delivered early years of program would become obsolete before

                        <p>Tedul 22. It is becoming increasingly apparent that our difficulties in
                            many parts of the world are result of our not fulfilling <pb n="460"
                                xml:id="pg_460" facs="0482"/>military commitments to foreign
                            governments, both large and small, which they had entered into with us
                            in good faith.</p>
                        <p>The Pakistan case is typical. A three year commitment for end items and
                            direct forces support, now estimated to cost $350 million, was entered
                            into in September 1954. With the period almost half gone, in early 1956,
                            we have delivered only $21 million of hardware and little if any direct
                            support. The same situation appears to exist in many other
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a brief description of the overall problems connected with
                            Defense spending and a suggestion that Secretary <persName

                        <p>The Vice President opened the conversation by asking President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> what topics were now of special
                            interest to him. President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName>
                            said first of all he wished to raise the question of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s recent statement on
                                neutralism<note n="2" xml:id="d213fn2">The text of the President’s
                                statement is printed in Department of State <hi rend="italic"

                            caused some difficulties in Pakistan. At the time Pakistan joined the
                            Baghdad Pact, the Government had met considerable opposition. They were
                            now being asked, “Are you sure the U.S. Government wants you in this
                            Pact?” <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> did not think that
                            the U.S. Government wanted to exclude Pakistan from such arrangements
                            and wished to point out that the Government of Pakistan had joined the
                            Baghdad Pact for the security of Pakistan, which to his mind is bound up
                            especially with the security of the area extending from Basra to the
                            Straits of Ormuz (i.e., Persian Gulf). At every opportunity he was
                            asking U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> officials what
                            arrangements they were planning for the security of that area. As far as
                            logistics were concerned, he thought that the U.S.S.R. could attack with
                            substantial forces at D Day plus 35 and, therefore, there must be a
                            defense plan to assemble defensive forces at D plus 30. In spite of all
                            his efforts, the President said he could not get the answer to the
                            question, “What forces will you make available to defend the area?” from
                            either American or British authorities.</p>
                        <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0486"/>
                        <p>The Vice President asked Colonel Watson to respond to this question.
                            Colonel Watson stated that the Joint Chiefs of Staff foresee no Soviet
                            aggression in this area as a separate action. It would only occur if
                            there were a global war. He thought that estimates of Russian
                            capabilities had overlooked the defensive capacity of U.S. strategic and
                            tactical armed forces and that the Russian capacity is exaggerated.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> asked whether
                            the U.S. could put in ground troops quickly enough. Colonel Watson
                            replied that special troops with special weapons could be quickly made
                            available and that the planning of the Baghdad Pact countries on the
                            military side was just getting under way.</p>
                        <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s remarks
                            were taken from context and that our position would be further
                            clarified. The Vice President then referred to the grand concept of the
                            area to be defended in the event of Russian aggression. He considered
                            that the Middle East and the European complex was equally involved and
                            that it was a prime objective of U.S. policy to prevent the area from
                            being overrun. Colonel Watson pointed out that the maintenance of ground
                            troops by the countries immediately involved, sufficiently strong to
                            stop the Russians, would break the economies of the countries in
                            question. President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> said
                            that if the U.S. joined the Baghdad Pact, Pakistan’s worries would be
                            over.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The Vice President then asked President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1"
                                >Mirza</persName> if he had considered the other type of attack,
                            erosion through subversion. President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1"
                                >Mirza</persName> by inference indicated that his greatest concern
                            in this context was with Tehran. The Iranian Army was not highly
                            regarded by <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName>; the officer
                            class was corrupt and by and large worthless. The soldiers, however,
                            were good and possibly some improvement was being made through the U.S.
                            military assistance group. The system under which Generals were paid a
                            lump sum for feeding the troops was very bad. He had told the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MZS1">Shah</persName> about this. He thought the
                                <persName corresp="#p_MZS1">Shah</persName> was shaping up well as a
                            leader. <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> was planning to
                            visit Iran in November and Turkey in July. His object was to cement the
                            Baghdad Pact countries as closely as possible.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> said
                            that he was especially concerned with Russian infiltration into
                            Afghanistan. The Afghans had obtained weapons from the Czechs and the
                            U.S.S.R. did not have to come out into the open. They were, however,
                            supporting the Afghans on the Pushtoonistan question, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> was especially worried about the
                            road program which is envisaged to encircle Afghanistan, tapping the
                            Russian military headquarters just across the Oxus. A road is also being
                            built from Fala to Zahedan, where <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465"
                                facs="0487"/>the Iranians are especially weak. He suggested the Vice
                            President impress upon the State Department and on the Pentagon that the
                            Afghan problem is of much greater significance than it has been in past
                            years and of considerable military importance.</p>
                        <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> asked what we
                            could do to ease the situation.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> replied that he
                            thought the situation justified increasing the Pakistan Army by one
                            infantry division to build up the total to five infantry divisions and
                            one and a half armored divisions…. He would leave no stone unturned to
                            come to an arrangement with the Afghans when he visits the King. He
                            would try to keep Pushtoonistan in cold storage for a five or ten year
                            period in agreement with the Afghans. He would try to establish a joint
                            border commission to settle cases of difficulties between the tribes. He
                            assured the Vice President that he would make every effort for a
                            peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President then turned the subject of the conversation to
                            neutralism. He said that this concerned the American leaders very
                            greatly, and asked what posture President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1"
                                >Mirza</persName> thought the U.S. should adopt. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> replied that despite his
                            personal dislike for the neutralists and particularly Nasser,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d213fn3">Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egyptian Prime Minister.</note>
                            he would, if he were responsible for U.S. policy, continue to give
                            economic aid to the neutrals if the aid in question was of any
                            importance to the masses. He would not help the neutrals as much as the
                            countries aligned with the U.S., but he saw no objection to extending
                            aid for projects designed to raise standards of living and remove the
                            masses from the threat of communism. He felt the same way about aid to
                            India. He would not stop American aid to India, if he had the say,
                            despite the fact that Pakistan’s relations with India are not good. If
                            questioned on this point by opposition groups in Pakistan, his answer
                            would be that his interest was in the aid that his country was given. He
                            agreed that America must take the world as a whole and not drive
                            neutrals into the communist camp by withholding aid.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, he would urge that we turn a deaf ear to Indian
                            protests concerning the aid that America was giving to Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President asked what President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1"
                                >Mirza</persName> thought was the effect of the new propaganda
                            “look” of <persName corresp="#p_BMNA1">Bulganin</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and of the Commie Chinese.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> replied that he
                            wondered whether there was a real change in policy until he read the
                            text of Mikoyan’s speech at the 20th Congress of Soviets. Examination of
                            this speech convinced him that the Soviets had changed their methods but
                            not their objectives which are no different in the <pb n="466"
                                xml:id="pg_466" facs="0488"/>present regime from those of their
                            predecessors. The Russians were very busy inviting Pakistanis to see
                            Russia.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President asked what the U.S. should do insofar as cultural and
                            trade contacts were concerned. President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1"
                                >Mirza</persName> implied that these were difficult to control.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that there was a great liking for China and the
                            Chinese in Pakistan. The Chinese were effective and intelligent people
                            with wonderful manners. They were very adept in “getting round” the
                            Pakistanis. The Pakistanis were very interested in visiting China and
                            would undoubtedly continue to do so. He was watching the Commie trend
                            very carefully and was not frightened. He pointed out that most of the
                            Commonwealth countries were busily trading with China, and as far as
                            Pakistan was concerned, they were glad to have the Chinese market
                            especially for their exports of cotton. They were also ready to do
                            business with the Russians, although he had blocked the establishment of
                            a Russian trade delegation in Dacca which would simply become another
                            communist cell.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President observed that President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1"
                                >Mirza</persName> appeared to regard these contacts as good business
                            but that he understood that they had no effect on Pakistan’s basic
                            foreign policies. He wondered about the exchange of persons program.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> replied that
                            there would not be much to this with Russia but that there was more
                            activity insofar as China was concerned. He said he had recently talked
                            with a mullah who had visited China and the mullah observed that
                            conditions looked good on the surface but as far as the Muslim religion
                            was concerned, the Chinese were keeping it alive for the older
                            generation and that Islam would be dead in China when the younger
                            generation came along.</p>
                        <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> observed that
                            it was his impression that President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1"
                                >Mirza</persName> felt it was in the U.S. interests not to be
                            bashful about standing in clearly with our friends and allies and that
                            we need not fear the effect on local governments of appearing too
                            friendly. President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> said
                            that his views were very clear on this and he agreed with the Vice
                            President. However, many of his Ministers did not agree with him. He
                            pointed out the attitude of the Egyptian Ambassador who had tried to
                            explain to <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> how to deal
                            with the U.S. According to the Egyptians, the best way was to accept aid
                            from the communists and then U.S. assistance would come forward in
                            greater volume. The Vice President and President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> both agreed that in the long run
                            such a policy would not work out, as it violated fundamental moral
                            issues.</p>
                        <p>At this point, the President called for Acting Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CII1">Chundrigar</persName>, Minister of Finance,
                                <persName corresp="#p_ASA1">Amjad Ali</persName>, and Acting
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs Rahimtoolah to join the gathering.</p>
                        <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0489"/>
                        <p>The Vice President asked whether our aid was moving fast enough, and
                            requested an outline of Pakistan’s economic problems.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CII1">Chundrigar</persName> pointed out that
                            Pakistan was still faced with three major problems; first, the need to
                            obtain materials for its industrial plants and to expand its industries;
                            secondly, its need for basic raw materials such as foodstuffs; and
                            third, the need to have aid move swiftly. He then raised the question of
                            Pakistan’s need for assistance in atomic energy needs.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CII1">Chundrigar</persName> said
                            that Pakistan’s problems insofar as atomic development are concerned are
                            twofold. First of all, India was establishing a $14,000,000 reactor,
                            having received half the cost from Canada for the foreign exchange
                            components of this installation, and a gift from the U.S. of $250,000
                            for heavy water. This was a striking contrast with the assistance
                            proferred by the U.S. to Pakistan, which was only half the cost of a
                            small reactor ($350,000) of no particular use to the Pakistanis.
                            Pakistan needed some help in a big way. Vice President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> agreed that this posed a
                            difficult political problem for the Pakistanis in view of Indian
                            neutralism and Pakistan’s alignment with the free world. Acting Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_CII1">Chundrigar</persName> continued
                            that Pakistan’s difficulties were compounded by U.S. action in setting
                            up the regional center in the Philippines. East Pakistan could use a
                            package power station such as that planned for the regional center at
                            Manila. Such an installation would help solve the power problem of East
                            Pakistan which was very serious, as shortages of power in East Pakistan
                            hampered the future of their jute market.</p>
                        <p>The Finance Minister continued by pointing out that the proposed atomic
                            center in Manila might be divided between Thailand, the Philippines and
                            East Pakistan, the three <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> members
                            concerned. If the installations were located in the three countries,
                            students could circulate, and the process would be a useful liaison for
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Turning to problems of aid, the Finance Minister pointed out the long
                            time required to make decisions. After Congressional appropriations in
                            July, allotments were generally delayed until November, and it was
                            difficult to finalize action in Pakistan on specific programs until late
                            winter or early spring. He pointed out that last year discussions for
                            the PL 480 program started in November, and while grateful for the
                            immediate shipments of rice and of wheat, the 1956 fiscal program had
                            still not been finalized so that it was necessary to fall back on mutual
                            security funds for necessary shipments of wheat.</p>
                        <p>The Finance Minister continued by pointing out the value of a buffer
                            stock of cereals in this part of the world. If such a stock were
                            established and the U.S. helped with storage facilities, the U.S. could
                            thereafter avoid continuous storage expenses which would be borne <pb
                                n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0490"/>by Pakistan. A stock of between
                            500,000 and 1,000,000 tons of wheat would be very valuable insurance
                            against panics in the local cereal markets, and it would be good public
                            relations to have a food base in Asia in contrast to airplane bases. He
                            thought arrangements could be made whereby grain could be moved and
                            stored each year and released only as needed. In response to a question
                            from the Vice President, the Finance Minister thought that the presence
                            of such a stock would go far to alleviate panic conditions, as generally
                            speaking the fear of shortages led to hoarding which exaggerated
                            difficulties such as the Government was now facing both in East and West
                            Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President asked about prospects of capital development and the
                            interest of private capital in Pakistan. The Finance Minister indicated
                            that the Pakistanis were attempting to attract American capital and had
                            been successful particularly in the case of the oil companies, with
                            Standard Vacuum and Hunt both exploring here. There was also interest
                            expressed by the Sun Oil Company in exploration. The Export Import Bank
                            was not functioning in Pakistan, but Pakistan had obtained lines of
                            credit totalling about $60,000,000 from the I.B.R.D.</p>
                        <p>Acting Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CII1">Chundrigar</persName>
                            pointed out that both Standard Vacuum and Burmah Shell had put up oil
                            refineries in India, and that an oil refinery in Pakistan would be very
                            useful for refining imported crude oil, if not for the eventual refining
                            of crude oil which very likely would be discovered in Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President thought that the Pakistanis should make special
                            efforts to attract private capital.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Prime Minister responded that Pakistan was a poor country and
                            that the U.S. businessmen think in large terms.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President then asked what he might say when he returned to
                            America which would be most helpful to Pakistan. The following points
                            were made by the President and the various Ministers: <list>

                                    suggested that the Vice President might talk privately about the
                                    military situation, especially Pakistan’s need for an additional
                                    division.</item>

                                    food which he thought should be rushed to Pakistan. He pointed
                                    out that rice had recently moved up in price from 15 to 50–70
                                    Rupees per maund.</item>

                        <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0491"/>
                        <p>The Vice President then asked what questions might arise when he talked
                            to reporters at the airport before his departure. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CII1">Chundrigar</persName> thought he would very likely
                            be questioned regarding neutralism, with particular reference to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s recent
                            statement, and that there would be questions about Kashmir.</p>
                        <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> then
                            suggested that visits by leading Pakistanis to Thailand and the
                            Philippines would be extremely valuable as both these countries needed
                            the moral support of their allies at this time. The President said he
                            was considering a trip to Indonesia and that President Soekarno was
                            coming to Pakistan in January. Vice President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> thought this was a good thing,
                            and that Pakistan would do well to cultivate the Indonesians with whom
                            they were joined by religious bonds.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> then said that we
                            frequently expressed ideas of “defensive armament”. He wondered what was
                            meant by this. He thought that after the results of the Korean war, we
                            had given up ideas that defense alone was of any value.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President observed that one must emphasize defense in public
                            statements as a political matter, but as far as what one did was
                            concerned, actions would be both defensive and offensive.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Watson pointed out that defensive armament was a political and
                            not a military concept.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> then reverted to
                            his interest in light bombers to permit the possibility of retaliation,
                            which might have an especially salutary effect on Afghanistan. He
                            recalled that in 1951 when conditions between India and Pakistan were
                            tense, the presence of six Halifax bombers had been known to the
                            Indians, and in all likelihood had prevented India’s attacking Pakistan.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> thought that a
                            light bomber squadron<note n="4" xml:id="d213fn4">President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> told the Chargé on the
                                evening of July 9th that he had just read a presentation made by
                                “his people in Washington” asking for two squadrons of light
                                bombers, and that he was “horrified” by the manner in which this
                                request had been put forward. A.Z.G. [Footnote in the source
                                text.]</note> would be very helpful in deterring Afghan aggression
                            as well as threats from India, although he stated that so far as war
                            with India was concerned, it would be both criminal and suicidal from
                            Pakistan’s point of view.</p>
                        <p>At this point, the conversation was broken off as it was necessary for
                            the Vice President and his party to return to the airport.<note n="5"

                                        >Mirza</persName> had obviously forgotten the previous
                                    conversation and said bluntly he had put pressure on <persName

                                    conversation saying to Prime Minister “When Nasser invitation

                                    that only acceptances were from Communist countries, and yet
                                    when invitation comes from West for conference in London you
                                    hesitate and are inclined not go. What goes on as far as foreign

                                <item>I told <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> that

                                    conversation with … me, had said he “felt previous governments
                                    had been very inept, negligent and stupid in not explaining the
                                    foreign policy to the people and pointing out the reasons and
                                    advantages for it and that he intended correct this”. I told

                                        >Mirza</persName> said “Well when is he going commence?”
                                        <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> then stated he
                                    had drafted a letter to Prime Minister on foreign policy which
                                    he had not yet sent but was waiting for proper provocation and
                                    proper time send it to him. I seized opening he gave us and said
                                    we would be very much interested in seeing his views. He left
                                    room and came back with four page memo and let <persName
                                        corresp="#p_RJP1">James</persName> and me each read a copy.
                                    It was a stinging reaffirmation of a very strong pro-West,
                                    pro-Free World, anti-Communist foreign policy. It emphasized

                                    future elections. He waxed firm and eloquent as usual on the
                                    theme he did not care whether or not he was President but what
                                    he would not stand for was a change in <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                                        >GOP</gloss> foreign policy. Said he had told <persName

                                    him to the hilt except if he washed out on form foreign policy
                                    or meddled with military and if <persName corresp="#p_SHS1"
                                        >Suhrawardy</persName> doublecrossed him in these respects
                                    he, <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName>, too could

                                    would have a revolution on his hands. President showed every
                                    indication that he intended to be in control of country but
                                    would back <persName corresp="#p_SHS1">Suhrawardy</persName> so
                                    long as <persName corresp="#p_SHS1">Suhrawardy</persName> did
                                    not cross him on foreign policy. Said people long had been
                                    accusing him of wanting to be a dictator but he had already
                                    shown time and again that if he could avoid military government
                                    he would go to great ends to do so. <persName corresp="#p_RJP1"
                                        >James</persName> interrupted to comment he had advised his

                                    seeking to find constitutional way out had taken greatest risk
                                    in his career in making <persName corresp="#p_SHS1"

                                    action. I commented that I felt that his record since he had
                                    been in office showed his desire avoid dictatorship and that I
                                    had advised my government that in taking <persName

                                    had taken only and last resort he had to get constitutional

                                >Suhrawardy</persName> attitude toward Commonwealth disturbing and
                            request you see him earliest to discuss situation along following
                            lines:</p>
                        <p>It unfortunately true that friends often conceive of their respective and
                            mutual interests in different lights and that serious misunderstandings
                            result. In present instance we, like Pakistani, are deeply concerned at
                            action taken by British and French in resorting to military force
                            against Egypt. We feel however long friendships which have existed
                            between us and vast mutual interests dictate highest order statesmanship
                            in dealing with problem which has arisen as result this difference
                            between us. It extremely important that unfortunate development not be
                            cause for break in Free World solidarity nor result in hasty actions
                            which would have far reaching effects.</p>
                        <p>Present instance serious though it is should not lead to any weakening
                            defense capabilities of Free World against Soviet imperialism. We of
                            course do not intend permit in any way slackening our support for mutual
                            security arrangements which include British and/or French. As far as
                            Pakistan concerned we would accordingly consider it a most serious
                            setback to security of Free World if Pakistan should withdraw from
                            Commonwealth, Baghdad Pact or <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"

                        <p>We realize that pressures of popular opinion in Pakistan may make
                            position Pakistan Government difficult. We have every confidence however
                            that high statesmanship of leading members of Pakistan Government will
                            find means to bring true interests of Pakistan home to people of
                            Pakistan.</p>

                                unstable, plagued by serious differences of interest and outlook
                                between the two parts of the country, by a dearth of responsible
                                leaders, by weak political institutions, and by widespread
                                frustration and discontent, particularly in East Pakistan. (Paras.

                                influence over the government, thus assuring a modicum of stability.

                                a year. However, Pakistan will almost certainly fail to realize a
                                substantial part of the plan goals by 1960 and, despite probable
                                progress in raising food grain production levels, will probably
                                remain subject to food shortages resulting from floods and droughts.

                                likely to lag, Pakistan will probably require a lower annual level
                                of economic assistance (exclusive of military aid) in <gloss

                                period following 1958, the probable rising expenditures for the
                                development program and the increase in annual costs of an enlarged

                                in US economic assistance. It is likely that Pakistan will be
                                dependent on larger-scale economic assistance by <gloss

                                will require continuing US matériel and direct forces support, not

                                active interest in regional defense matters, at least in the absence
                                of greatly increased US support. It would probably be unwilling to
                                grant military bases to the US in peacetime, and almost certainly
                                remain unwilling to commit more than token forces for use under

                                <item>One major drawback is continuing difficulties with India, and

                                    stated frankly “When Pakistanis speak of ‘defense’ they speak of
                                    defense against India”. Danger of explosion is always present.
                                    In addition dispute with India causes diversion of resources and
                                    attention from internal problems and Soviet enemy. Pakistan now
                                    carrying crushing burden of defense expenditures which it
                                    considers necessary for protection against India.</item>

                                <item>I was deeply impressed by positive attitude present Pakistani
                                    leaders. They appear determined to make success of their nation
                                    despite obstacles mentioned above. Sense of activity and drive
                                    for sake of Pakistan as nation especially striking in contrast
                                    to Iran. I consider this vitality one of Pakistan’s greatest
                                    assets.</item>

                                <item>Pakistanis opened our discussions on premise of full
                                    acceptance ME proposal. Concluding remarks of President were “We
                                    shall be with you in fair weather or foul; we hope you will be
                                    with us”. Prime Minister stated “You are taking us for granted
                                    as we are taking you for granted”. Pakistan’s effort directed at
                                    interpreting ME proposals in widest sense possible. They pressed
                                    hard to determine whether proposals designed to cope with
                                    internal Communist subversion. I replied US ready to strengthen
                                    area governments against possibility of subversion but provision
                                    of joint resolution re US Armed Forces would not come into play
                                    if Communist government attained power as result internal
                                    causes. To use troops in such circumstances would violate
                                    concept of sovereignty and right of peoples to choose freely
                                    their own form of government. We also made clear resolution
                                    directed only at attack or subversion by international
                                    communism. (Pakistanis tried several times to interpret it to
                                    cover possible attack from India.)</item>

                                    case other Baghdad Pact members, Pakistanis urged we join Pact
                                    and stressed evils neutralism. I thought Pakistanis went quite
                                    far in offering try to reach understanding with Afghanistan.

                            reception accorded him. (Prime Minister has autographed picture of

                            his drawing room.) I said <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>
                            under his mask of charm was most dangerous Communist of all and in past

                        <p>Prime Minister declared at our first meeting that Pakistan would not use
                            opportunity of visit by Mission to plead for more aid. This position
                            characterized attitude throughout. Pakistanis were not waiting in line
                            with long list of demands. In discussion their economic needs they
                            placed particular emphasis on annual shortfall in food production which
                            is reflected in annual severe drain on US aid funds and Pakistan’s
                            exchange reserves. In addition fertilizer factories, Minister of Finance
                            stressed need for food reserve and hope that US would approve three year
                            surplus agricultural program (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HHA1"
                                >Hildreth</persName> strongly endorsed this request). Minister also
                            brought up need for shipping for trade to Persian Gulf and between East
                            and West Pakistan. Prime Minister stressed requirement for housing;
                            steel and concrete for strategic roads; and flood control in East
                            Pakistan. (Data on number projects given Mission March 29.)</p>
                        <p>Finance Minister raised question private investment, pointing to

                            domestic investment opportunities. He also referred to Pakistan’s

                            orderly transition from government by small bureaucratic clique to
                            effective parliamentary system conducted by political parties supporting
                            foreign and domestic policies in line with US aims. Imposition
                            President’s rule would lead many to conclude that representative regime
                            cannot exist in same system with expanded Pakistan military strength.
                            Embassy realizes potential danger exists in East Pakistan from Communist

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SHS1">Suhrawardy</persName> declared
                            that food was the most important economic question facing Pakistan.
                            Pakistan was short of basic foodstuffs, although he was making every
                            effort to increase production. Pakistan had to have one million tons of
                            wheat this year. He had instructed his Finance Minister,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d221fn2"><persName corresp="#p_ASA1">Syed Amjad
                                    Ali</persName>.</note> who had been in Washington for some time,
                            to ask for 1½ million tons so that there might be a reserve to tide
                            Pakistan over until the next crop was in sight. He described that
                            inclination of Pakistani foodgrain producers to withhold current crops
                            from the market until a second food crop appeared assured.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister characterized the foodgrain request as having top
                            priority over all other requests he was making. Pakistan could perhaps
                            get along somehow without the other things he was asking for, but the
                            United States should not withhold foodgrains from Pakistan if it wished
                            to see Pakistan avoid starvation, revolution, inflation and chaos.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister declared that Pakistan fully appreciated US aid, but
                            that there was no getting around the fact that developmental aid had an
                            inflationary impact on the domestic economy. Two alternative means of
                            combatting such inflation existed: greater production and/or the import
                            of consumer needs. He was doing what he could to increase production.
                            (His implication was that the US <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0504"
                            />should contribute to combatting inflation by making available import
                            commodities such as foodgrains.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHS1">Suhrawardy</persName> also reiterated
                            Pakistan’s interest in obtaining an atomic reactor. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> had said that India was getting
                            on in this field, and yet Pakistan did not have a single atomic
                            reactor.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said that he understood that Pakistani representatives had
                            discussed military assistance proposals with Defense officials on July
                                10.<note n="2" xml:id="d222fn2">At this meeting, actually held on
                                July 11, Pakistani officials requested a commitment from the
                                Department of Defense for additional military aid, including four
                                light bomber squadrons with accompanying radar equipment. They also
                                indicated that they would soon provide Defense with a complete list
                                of equipment which the Pakistani Government believed was necessary
                                as part of “phase two” of the U.S. military assistance program.

                            understanding, Defense officials had promised to consider the Pakistani
                            request.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHS1">Suhrawardy</persName> responded that in
                            order to provide adequately for Pakistani needs it would be necessary
                            that the Defense Department receive guidance from the Department of
                            State. He hoped that the Department of State would use its influence
                            with the Department <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0505"/>of Defense
                            in order to obtain the agreement of the latter to the Pakistani request.
                            He wanted a submarine if the Defense Department agrees that it would be
                            a good thing for Pakistan to have. Arguing that his motives were similar
                            to those of the US in wanting a nuclear bomb deterrent to Soviet
                            aggression, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHS1">Suhrawardy</persName>
                            stressed that he wanted light bombers as a deterrent against possible
                            Indian aggression.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had observed with concern the tendency of a
                            number of states in the Middle East to give too much emphasis to the
                            buildup of their military forces. For example, Egypt had sacrificed much
                            in order to obtain large amounts of military equipment, which it had
                            done from the Soviet Union. Where was the equipment now? A great deal of
                            it was in the possession of the enemy of Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHS1">Suhrawardy</persName> replied that
                            Pakistan did not fit in this category; he wanted only useful weapons.
                            Pakistan was taking good care of its tanks, although the tank force was
                            at present static. Pakistan did not want new tanks, however. Bombers
                            were essential. A submarine was also most important. One of its most
                            important uses would be to provide opportunities for training. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> responded that he
                            would be glad to consider the possibility of training Pakistanis in
                            submarines in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Recalling his earlier claim that <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> had been deterred from attacking Pakistan in 1950
                            by Pakistan’s possession of bombers, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHS1"
                                >Suhrawardy</persName> noted that four or twelve or eighteen bombers
                            in Pakistan’s hands today would enable Pakistan to deter but not to
                            compete with or attack India. He reiterated that the US must have
                            confidence that Pakistan would not misuse such equipment.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that the US does have great confidence in
                            Pakistan’s non-aggressive intent. Otherwise, he declared, the US would
                            not be doing what it now is in the way of supplying arms.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHS1">Suhrawardy</persName> expressed
                            dissatisfaction that light bombers which had originally been programmed
                            for 1954 were now being programmed for 1959. He emphasized that Pakistan
                            realized bombers were expensive to maintain, and that this was the
                            reason Pakistan wished to begin with only a few of them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> observed that one
                            consideration involved was that in the judgment of our military experts
                            Pakistan would not be ready to absorb bombers for some time. Mr. Husain
                            responded that when programming bombers was first deferred, Pakistan was
                            told it was because bombers are offensive weapons. He declared that the
                            Pakistan Air Force had now absorbed fighters and that bombers were the
                            logical next step.</p>

                            of military assistance by observing that the Department of State would

                            Defense.</p>

                            in splinter parties, sectionalism and in individuals jockeying for power
                            and its material rewards, it may be useful consider briefly broad
                            background against which last crisis was played out.</p>
                        <p>The economic situation remains serious with the workers standard of
                            living tending to decrease. Pakistan statistics are uncertain yet little
                            doubt but that food prices have gone up from 10–15 percent in past year
                            while no comparable wage increase occurred. Other characteristics of the
                            Pakistan economic situation too well known warrant detailed review in
                            summary analysis (no progress in agricultural productivity which is sine
                            qua non for Pakistan self-sufficiency; shortage of capital and foreign
                            exchange for development, incipient inflation, disproportionately high
                            military expenditures and population growing faster than national
                            income). Only reason why Pakistan able keep going is US aid. This only
                            realized small thinking elite, including officer corps, since effect on
                            masses restricted to helping preserve present inadequate South Asian
                            standard of living rather than bring about noticeable amelioration.</p>
                        <p>It is against this unsatisfactory background that <persName

                                corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName>, probably the most able Pakistan

                            longer be maintained. Purpose of this message is not to go into the
                            issues, real or alleged, which surround the crisis, such as one-unit or
                            joint vs separate electorates which have been reported on in detail. In
                            essence generally democratic but also demagogic <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHS1">Suhrawardy</persName> let himself be carried away
                            either by design or accident in his public attacks against President

                            to a point of no return and President in turn by availing himself of
                            letter of the constitution and refusing to convene assembly so that vote
                            could determine whether his opponent commanded a majority, provided
                            further grist for mill those who accused him of authoritarianism.</p>
                        <p>Now replacing <persName corresp="#p_SHS1">Suhrawardy</persName> in role
                            of <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName>’s personal opponent is
                            Sardar Nishtar, President Muslim League. In this struggle for power the
                            decent but rather colorless Muslim League Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CII1">Chundrigar</persName> participates only in a
                            secondary role. It is of course importance of role played by Nishtar
                            which raises questions in foreign policy field. While policies of direct
                            importance to us are maintained and while President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> remains as Western oriented as
                            ever, key role of … Nishtar tends weaken structure underlying official
                            government posture assurances. New government thus affected by Islamic
                            bias against <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and indirectly against
                            West which Muslim Leaguers have brought into coalition. Furthermore
                                <persName corresp="#p_CII1">Chundrigar</persName> cannot put up as
                            effective resistance as could <persName corresp="#p_SHS1"
                                >Suhrawardy</persName> to Pakistani emotionalism during flareups
                            such as occurred over <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-French Suez
                            action. While it is unlikely above will go so far as to result in
                            attempt to improve relations with Syria and Egypt, it is apparent that
                            the “quality” of the new government’s support for current foreign
                            policies has somewhat deteriorated.</p>
                        <p>The internal prospects of the new government are none too bright on the
                            tactical plane. The situation in the Assembly has become even more
                            complex and less predictable with the formation of the new five man
                            party of <persName corresp="#p_ACM1">Chaudhri Mohamad Ali</persName>,
                            probably with tacit consent <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1"
                                >Mirza</persName>, which could draw off Punjabi strength from either
                            Muslim League and/or Republicans. The alliance between Republicans and
                            Muslim League is none too strong in Karachi and does not exist in Lahore
                            where major strain on coalition likely develop. Here Defense Minister
                            Daultana will probably be key figure in maneuvers to get share of power
                            for self as well as Muslim League.</p>
                        <p>From longer range viewpoint, situation worse re East Pakistan which is
                            seriously antagonized by “raw deal” to “their boy” <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHS1">Suhrawardy</persName>, inadequate representation

                            more than West. Some in government conscious of these major difficulties
                            which faced in East Pakistan. So far, however, this reflected
                            principally in inconclusive consideration of creating a deputy Prime

                            Until now major development under new government has been exploitation
                            for political purposes of so-called $10 million import license scandal
                            under small business program (<gloss target="#t_Toica1">Toica</gloss>

                            much which has happened during last few weeks, tends further to retard
                            development of healthy Pakistan resting on sound democratic government.
                            Of course political, economic and social conditions which would create
                            an immediately explosive situation in a politically more advanced
                            society could last indefinitely in Pakistan. Experience in other lesser
                            developed countries demonstrates, however, the unwisdom of excessive
                            reliance on fatalism and amorphism of such societies be they Muslim or
                            not. While no direct threat looms on Pakistan horizon and while the army
                            with its excellent morale and fine equipment can be relied on as a safe
                            anchor to windward for the foreseeable future it would appear to be at
                            least questionable statesmanship to rely primarily on this element of
                            the framework of the Pakistan state. Whether or not it “may be <hi
                                rend="italic">later</hi> than it seems” is a moot question. The bold
                            fact stands out as the <persName corresp="#p_CII1">Chundrigar</persName>
                            government takes over with little confidence, that over-all situation in
                            Pakistan is deteriorating while military programs may be proceeding
                            satisfactorily. Military strength, without a sound economic and
                            political base, does not constitute real strength in South Asia or
                            elsewhere. It is time to rethink our approach to the Pakistan problem.
                            Our rationale for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 will attempt
                            start along this path. A more comprehensive review, however, is called
                            for, which should give greater weight to developing Pakistan as a strong
                            viable ally of the US rather than concentrating on building of a
                            military force which may not have vis-à-vis Communist bloc a value in
                            proportion with its cost both to Pakistan and to US. That such changes
                            must of course be brought about with tact and prudence so that in the
                            process existing elements of strength and friendship will not be
                            alienated is of course obvious.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Bill</hi>: You may have realized better than I
                            did when I left Washington that in Pakistan we have an unruly horse by
                            the tail and are confronted by the dilemma of trying to tame it before
                            we can let go safely. That takes some doing and I have the uneasy
                            feeling that far from being tamed this horse we assumed to be so
                            friendly has actually grown wilder of late.</p>
                        <p>The enticements which we have managed from our unfavorable position don’t
                            seem to have worked well enough and I believe the time is overripe for
                            us to reappraise our situation as best we can while still in motion and
                            put some new methods into action. To do this we whose hands are on the
                            tail need an assist from Washington.</p>
                        <p>I wonder if we have not collectively developed certain generalizations
                            about Pakistan and then proceeded to accept them as gospel truth without
                            sufficient periodic scrutiny. For example, I was told that Pakistan
                            constitutes a cornerstone of U.S. policy in this part of the world, that
                            Pakistan is the anchor of the Baghdad Pact, and of <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, that the Paks are strong, direct,
                            friendly and virile, and that Pakistan constitutes a bulwark of strength
                            in the area, etc. What concerns me is that all this is in real danger of
                            being wiped out if something is not done to arrest the current
                            deterioration in many aspects of Pakistani life.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Political</hi>. The recent governmental crises in
                            Pakistan have highlighted the increasingly byzantine and sterile
                            characteristics of political activities here. As the new government
                            takes over<note n="2" xml:id="d224fn2"><persName corresp="#p_NMFK1"

                            it looks as if things would become worse before they improve. When I
                            left home <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHS1">Suhrawardy</persName> were partners and our great
                            hope here. Now they are bitter political enemies and the weakling
                                <persName corresp="#p_NMFK1">Noon</persName> is Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Economic</hi>. Economically deterioration is steadily
                            developing and this notwithstanding the aid which the U.S. has invested
                            in Pakistan. As matters now stand the rate of deterioration is tending
                            to accelerate, what with continuation at a constant or increasing level
                            of unproductive expenses (military and government operating costs) and a
                            decline in the productive part of the budget. Unfortunately, I <pb
                                n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0510"/>fear that our past generosity
                            in helping out our friends has too often permitted them to avoid
                            “grasping the nettle” and facing their problems with the required spirit
                            of urgency and determination. While statistics can be misleading,
                            particularly in Pakistan where they are most unreliable, I am
                            nevertheless convinced that the cost of living is increasing with an
                            appreciable decline in the standard of living of Pakistani wage earners
                            in view of the lag in their paper income. Also there can be no doubt but
                            that large portions of both the business and governmental communities
                            are corrupt and that this has had its effect on the energies and
                            determination of the entire population.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Psychological</hi>. Psychologically, also, I find the
                            Pakistani situation disturbing. It is only among the very small upper
                            crust (senior army officers, top group of politicians, leading
                            businessmen, and a few other elements here and there who are directly
                            connected with the benefits of American assistance) that a state of mind
                            is found which corresponds to the cliché depicting the Pakistanis as the
                            only strongly pro-U.S. and pro-western oriented people in this part of
                            the world. As to the remaining vast majority of Pakistanis, while I have
                            not encountered an inclination towards communism or the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, there is an underlying yearning for
                            “friendship with all.” On the part of what we might call the middle
                            group or the intelligentsia, i.e. vocal educated elements without vested
                            interest in the present regime—and this even includes a significant
                            proportion of civil servants—there is an appalling contempt for the
                            governing clique which is viewed as selfish, corrupt, and intent only on
                            advancing their own political or cash fortunes. At least until the
                            elections are held there is slight prospect for improvement and a real
                            danger of further deterioration. The situation of strength which we have
                            accepted as synonymous with Pakistan has too large a component of
                            wishful thinking.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Militarily</hi>. The first conclusion which I have
                            reached is that Pakistan’s military establishment must be appreciably
                            trimmed. No “Holcomb costing analysis” is needed to formulate this
                            recommendation. Such an analysis would be useful to help determine <hi
                                rend="italic">how much</hi> the armed forces should be cut but not
                                <hi rend="italic">whether</hi> they should be reduced. At the
                            present time Pakistan military expenses absorb approximately 65% of the
                            government’s tax revenues. The drain on the economy is such that U.S.
                            aid, as important as it is, only serves to maintain precarious living
                            standards, and, while this is important, it is difficult for the man in
                            the street to appreciate a benefit which has to be measured in almost
                            negative terms!</p>
                        <p>I fear that it would not be too difficult to make a rather convincing
                            case that the present military program is based on a hoax, the hoax
                            being that it is related to the Soviet threat. Instead it <pb n="489"
                                xml:id="pg_489" facs="0511"/>is my view that the <gloss
                                target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> forces are in betwixt and in
                            between—they are unnecessarily large for their prime purpose of assuring
                            internal security and likewise unnecessarily large for dealing with any
                            Afghan threat over Pushtunistan (barring of course larger Soviet aid
                            than that currently being rumored). However, concentration on India is
                            such that a considerably larger Pakistan arms program would not yield a
                            division for use to the west within the Baghdad Pact area.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. in appraising its own interests via-à-vis either India or
                            Pakistan should recognize as its basic premise the indivisible character
                            of its relations with and interest in the entire subcontinent. I am
                            convinced that a portion of the military strength built up in Pakistan
                            would be of little use to us should perchance worst come to worst and
                            India go communist. Likewise, and even though India is undoubtedly less
                            vulnerable to events in Pakistan, the larger country would hardly profit
                            from a complete breakdown of the embryonic structure of political
                            democracy in Pakistan. Therefore, we cannot afford to participate in or
                            close our eyes to an arms race between Pakistan and India.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendations</hi>. Consequently, and as a <hi
                                rend="italic">first concrete step</hi> I recommend that I be
                            instructed to approach President <persName corresp="#p_MMGI1"
                                >Mirza</persName> personally and most confidentially and express our
                            serious concern to him. In particular, I should recognize the
                            commitments made by the U.S. in the aide-mémoire of October 1954. I
                            should point out that the U.S. is not trying to renege; the U.S.,
                            however, believes that when these commitments were entered into in good
                            faith their full consequences were not, and could not, be appreciated.
                            Certainly no pact or agreement between such staunch and loyal friends as
                            the U.S. and Pakistan can be permitted to become a mutual “suicide
                            pact.”</p>
                        <p>The object of this démarche would be to lead President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MMGI1">Mirza</persName> into taking the initiative for a
                            costing and evaluation study so as to set the outer limits of the
                            Pakistan military program, both in military and financial terms. As I
                            have cautioned in several telegrams, it is extremely important that in
                            seeking to extricate ourselves from the present worrisome situation we
                            not unintentionally render the situation acute by appearing to be
                            withdrawing our support from those elements which, for whatever motive,
                            and however imperfect, are currently our closest friends and supporters.
                            Thus it is imperative that the review of the Pakistan military

                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">second immediate measure</hi> has already been
                            initiated by the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>: a review of the
                            U.S. aid program so as to eliminate secondary or marginal projects and
                            concentrate on those of greater benefits to the Pakistan economy.</p>
                        <p>My <hi rend="italic">third recommendation</hi> calls for a generally more
                            critical and somewhat tougher attitude towards our friends. This policy
                            is already <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0512"/>partially operative,
                            as when I asked that the $10,000,000 special machinery project be
                            stopped because within the Pakistan Government itself the economic
                            validity of many of the items in the project was being publicly
                            questioned.</p>
                        <p>One of the most disturbing attitudes I have encountered in the highest
                            political places here is that the United States <hi rend="italic"
                                >must</hi> keep up and increase its aid to Pakistan, and conversely,
                            that Pakistan is doing the U.S. a favor in accepting aid, in addition to
                            the Pakistan pro-western posture in the Baghdad Pact and <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>, when actually these postures are in part dictated by
                            Pakistan hatred for India.</p>
                        <p>I don’t expect gratitude can be bought here any more than anywhere else,
                            but I do believe that the U.S. is entitled to a reasonable degree of
                            respect. Finally, we are trying for quality rather than quantitative
                            solutions.</p>
