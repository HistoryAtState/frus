                <head>About the Series</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the U.S. Government. The Historian of the
                    Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the preparation of
                        the<hi rend="italic"> Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of the Office
                    of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of the General
                    Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of State
                    Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series which was signed by
                    President <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George H.W. Bush</persName> on October
                    28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of
                    State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.). </p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions
                    and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should
                    include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major
                    foreign policy decisions and actions of the U.S. Government. The statute also
                    confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles of
                    historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions
                    made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the
                    published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching
                    a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a
                    defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume meets all regulatory,
                    statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and editing.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the <hi rend="roman">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    Series</p>
                <p>The Foreign Relations statute requires that the published record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all records needed to
                    provide comprehensive documentation of major U.S. foreign policy decisions and
                    significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires that government
                    agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government en<pb n="IV" facs="0005" xml:id="pg_IV"/>gaged in foreign policy formulation, execution,
                    or support cooperate with the Department of State historians by providing full
                    and complete access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions
                    and by providing copies of selected records. Most of the sources consulted in
                    the preparation of this volume have been declassified and are available for
                    review at the National Archives and Records Administration (Archives II) in
                    College Park, Maryland.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and the memoranda of conversations
                    between the President and the Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the
                    files of overseas diplomatic posts. The records that constitute the Department’s
                    central files for 1981–1989, which were stored in electronic and microfilm
                    formats, will eventually be transferred to the National Archives. Once these
                    files are declassified and processed, they will be accessible. All of the
                    Department’s decentralized office files from this period that the National
                    Archives deems worthy of permanent preservation will also eventually be
                    transferred to the National Archives where they will be available for use after
                    declassification and processing.</p>
                <p>Research for <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes is undertaken
                    through special access to restricted documents at the Ronald Reagan Presidential
                    Library and other agencies. While all the material printed in this volume has
                    been declassified, some of it is extracted from still-classified documents. The
                    staff of the Reagan Library is processing and declassifying many of the
                    documents used in this volume, but they may not be available in their entirety
                    at the time of publication. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the
                    Reagan Library include some of the most significant foreign affairs related
                    documentation from White House offices, the Department of State, and other
                    federal agencies including the National Security Council, the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff.</p>
                <p>Some of the research for volumes in this subseries was done in Reagan Library
                    record collections scanned for the Remote Archive Capture (RAC) project. This
                    project, which is administered by the National Archives and Records
                    Administration’s Office of Presidential Libraries, was designed to coordinate
                    the declassification of still classified records held in various Presidential
                    libraries. As a result of the way in which records were scanned for the RAC, the
                    editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series were not always
                    able to determine whether attachments <pb n="V" facs="0006" xml:id="pg_V"/>to a
                    given document were in fact attached to the paper copy of the document in the
                    Reagan Library file. In such cases, some editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have indicated this ambiguity by stating that
                    the attachments were “Not found attached.”</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to time in Washington, DC.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the Declassification and
                    Publishing Division. The original document is reproduced as exactly as possible,
                    including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the footnotes.
                    Texts are transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions for the
                    publication of historical documents within the limitations of modern typography.
                    A heading has been supplied by the editors for each document included in the
                    volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the
                    original text, except that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected.
                    Other mistakes and omissions in the documents are corrected by bracketed
                    insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman type.</p>
                <p>Words or phrases underlined in the original document are printed in italics.
                    Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the original text, and
                    a list of abbreviations and terms is included in the front matter of each
                    volume. In telegrams, the telegram number (including special designators such as
                    Secto) is printed at the start of the text of the telegram.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type).</p>
                <p>The amount and, where possible, the nature of the material not declassified has
                    been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of text that were omitted.
                    Entire documents withheld after declassification review have been accounted for
                    and are listed in their chronological place with headings, source notes, and the
                    number of pages not declassified.</p>
                <p>All brackets that appear in the original document are so identified in the
                    footnotes. All ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the sources of the document and its
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important docu<pb n="VI" facs="0007" xml:id="pg_VI"/>ments and policies and indicates whether the President or his major policy
                    advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p>The numbers in the index refer to document numbers rather than to page
                    numbers.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation </p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, monitors the overall
                    compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all aspects of
                    the preparation of the series and declassification of records.</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee does not necessarily review the contents of individual
                    volumes in the series, but it makes recommendations on issues that come to its
                    attention and reviews volumes as it deems necessary to fulfill its advisory and
                    statutory obligations.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 13526 on Classified National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this volume, which began in 2014 and was completed in
                    2015, resulted in the decision to withhold no documents in full, and to make
                    minor excisions of less than a paragraph in 12 documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and editorial notes presented here
                    provide a thorough, accurate, and reliable <pb n="VII" facs="0008" xml:id="pg_VII"/>record of the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> administration’s policy toward the Soviet Union from
                    January 1981 until January 1983.</p>

                <p>This volume tracks the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                    administration’s efforts to construct a new framework for U.S. relations with
                    the Soviet Union after the collapse of détente. It commences with <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Ronald Reagan</persName>’s election on November 4, 1980,
                    and concludes with his approval of National Security Decision Directive 75,
                    “U.S. Relations With the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>,” on January 17,
                    1983. The main principles guiding the selection of documents were whether they
                    shed light on high-level diplomacy between Washington and Moscow or the
                    formulation of U.S. policies toward the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>At the outset of the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                    administration, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Alexander
                        Haig</persName> sought to be the “vicar” of foreign policy. He took the lead
                    on Soviet matters, flanked by State Department officials <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Walter Stoessel</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Lawrence Eagleburger</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Richard
                        Burt</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> clashed with
                    White House officials, jousted with Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Caspar Weinberger</persName>, and refused to send copies
                    of his memoranda of conversation with Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Andrei Gromyko</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_PR_2">Richard Pipes</persName>, the chief Soviet adviser on the National Security
                    Council staff.</p>
                <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> decided to restore the
                    status of the President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs which he had
                    previously diminished to avoid the internal conflicts that plagued three
                    previous administrations. <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                    appointed <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">William Clark</persName> on January 4,
                    1982, to <pb n="X" facs="0011" xml:id="pg_X"/>succeed <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Richard Allen</persName>. On June 25, he accepted
                        <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s resignation and asked former
                    Secretary of the Treasury <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George Shultz</persName>
                    to be the next Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>With his new team in place that summer, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> signed off on the terms of reference for a comprehensive
                    strategic review of U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union, National Security Study
                    Directive 11–82, “U.S. Policy Toward the Soviet Union.” The result, National
                    Security Decision Directive 75, which <persName corresp="#p_PR_2">Pipes</persName> drafted, begins: “U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union will
                    consist of three elements: external resistance to Soviet imperialism; internal
                    pressure on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to weaken the sources of
                    Soviet imperialism; and negotiations to eliminate, on the basis of strict
                    reciprocity, outstanding disagreements.”</p>
                <p>The documentation leading up to NSDD–75 offers a wide-angle view of Cold War
                    flashpoints during the period January 1981–January 1983. These include: the
                    Soviet occupation of Afghanistan; the potential Soviet invasion of Poland; the
                    possibility that the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                    administration would act to delay Soviet construction of a Siberian gas pipeline
                    to Western Europe; the implications of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s
                        (<gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>) 1979 “Dual Track Decision” to
                    deploy Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missiles while also seeking arms
                    negotiations; and the implementation of a strategic modernization program for
                    the United States. For a sharper focus on these issues, readers should consult

                <p>Three objectives that generated consensus among <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> and his advisers were to impel the Soviet Union to
                    withdraw military support for Cuba and Nicaragua (which were, in turn, funneling
                    arms to anti-government forces in El Salvador), lean on Cuba to withdraw from
                    Angola, and rein in Syria from its proxy campaign in the Lebanese Civil War.

                <p>Additionally, there were three cases of Soviet human rights abuses that drew and
                    sustained President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s attention:

                    <p>2. Summary: After initial surprise over the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> landslide victory, Soviet officials are venting their
                        frustrations over Soviet relations with the <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> administration and intensely watching personalities
                        in the new administration for clues to future behavior. They are saying that
                        a workable relationship can be developed but they emphasize the importance
                        of negotiating at least a modified version of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. They hope for early contact with members of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> foreign policy team as
                        part of the process in deciding how to deal with it. Our refusenik and
                        dissident contacts are unhappy over the election’s outcome, fearing the new
                        administration will lessen the U.S. commitment to human rights. End
                        summary.</p>
                    <p>3. After an early <gloss target="#t_TASS_1">TASS</gloss> report explaining
                        the President’s defeat at the polls in terms of the state of the U.S.
                        economy and U.S. foreign policy, the Soviet press has settled on the line
                        that the primary cause was the President’s foreign policy and the decline of
                        detente. This has the convenience of allowing Soviet propagandists to
                        recycle all of their criticisms already made about the <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> administration as well as validating
                        those criticisms for the Soviet public. We have not seen any <pb n="2" facs="0033" xml:id="pg_2"/>public assessment of future relations with
                        the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> administration other than
                        bland comments to the effect that a person often speaks differently as
                        President than as a candidate and that a country’s foreign policy depends on
                        “objective conditions” not personalities.</p>
                    <p>4. The public criticism of President <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>’s foreign policy are the iceberg tip of much stronger
                        private expressions of displeasure. Soviets who some weeks ago said they
                        hoped <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> would win now feel
                        free—in classic Soviet style—to express in full their frustrations over the
                        past four years. Comments that the administration’s foreign policy was
                        “erratic,” that “<persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> betrayed us,”
                        etc., have been repeatedly made to us and other foreigners in Moscow by
                        Soviet officials.</p>
                    <p>5. At the same time, Soviets who deal with U.S. matters are intensely
                        studying and probing for the implications of the election. While most
                        concentrate on possible personalities in the future executive branch—who
                        will <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> choose as Secretary of
                        State, Secretary of Defense, National Security Advisor<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">On December 11, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> nominated <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Caspar
                                Weinberger</persName> to be Secretary of Defense; on December 16, he
                            nominated <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Alexander Haig</persName> to be
                            Secretary of State; and, on December 23, he appointed <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Richard Allen</persName> as Assistant to the
                            President for National Security Affairs.</note> and where will other
                        foreign policy appointees fit in the republican ideological spectrum—others
                        are beginning to ask quite sophisticated questions about the new Senate,
                        committee changes in the House, and how the conservative American mood
                        demonstrated by the election will affect relations with the Soviet Union,
                        the U.S. posture abroad, and military expenditures.</p>
                    <p>6. For at least a partial answer, the Soviets will be looking intensely at
                        the President-elect’s early appointments. The implications of those
                        appointments as interpreted here may do much to set the initial Soviet
                        approach to the new administration. The Soviets also hope to make contact
                        soon with the new group. The importance of Governor Harriman’s trip to the
                        Soviet Union four years ago as an emissary of then President-elect <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> has been pointed to.<note n="4" xml:id="d1fn4">Reference is to Averell Harriman’s September 1976 trip to
                            Moscow on behalf of <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> to
                            meet <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>.</note> Some here
                        are wondering if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> will use
                        a similar device to establish early contact. In contrast to the generally
                        optimistic “wait and see” approach, we have one report, from an American
                        journalist, that <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> has said it
                        may be necessary to give Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                        “some black eyes” to teach him realities.</p>
                    <p>7. The Soviets we or our friends have talked with have expressed most
                        interest in the new administration’s approach to arms control. Some are
                        already thinking outloud about modifications in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II that could meet Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s oft-stated intention to renegotiate <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. They naturally emphasize that new
                        talks would require concessions on both sides, but they repeat their
                        standard formula that they are <pb n="3" facs="0034" xml:id="pg_3"/>willing
                        to meet the new administration half-way and respond to any initiatives. We
                        have heard nothing thus far about possible implications for the Afghanistan
                        issue and U.S. sanctions.</p>
                    <p>8. Two groups which seem unhappy with the outcome of the election are the
                        refuseniks and dissidents. Those we have talked with retain a great deal of
                        good feeling toward President <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>
                        because of his strong stand on human rights. They are concerned that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> will not pursue with
                        equal tenacity that policy which they feel has benefited them.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">DISCUSSION</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> has requested an
                        appointment for January 22 to deliver an “urgent” message from <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. We have queried Soviet
                        Minister-Counselor <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>, who
                        tells us that the message is basically a congratulatory one and that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> only needs 5 or <pb n="4" facs="0035" xml:id="pg_4"/>10 minutes. He also tells us that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> mentioned his desire to
                        call on you when he saw you at one of the Inaugural events. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> would not wish to give the message
                        to anyone else, and <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>
                        pressed for Thursday on grounds that it was customary, and important, that
                        you receive the message from your “most important counterpart” without
                        delay.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> is obviously anxious to be
                        among the first ambassadors to call on you, both for prestige reasons and to
                        take soundings on your attitude toward dealing with the Soviets. One option
                        would be to refuse to receive him until sometime next week, in order to
                        reflect our attitude toward the despicable way in which Soviet propaganda
                        has handled the hostage release question. One disadvantage of that, however,
                        is that the longer you wait to receive <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> the more difficult it will be to limit the first
                        meeting to a courtesy call and the greater the danger of having him try to
                        open up a substantive dialogue. You will no doubt wish to have a substantive
                        conversation with him at some point, in order to outline the general
                        approach which the Administration intends to take toward US-Soviet
                        relations. But as you presumably would not wish to have that meeting for
                        some time yet, there would be an advantage to getting the courtesy call out
                        of the way quickly. There is the additional factor that, in good times and
                        bad, our Ambassador in Moscow has generally been able to see <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> promptly when he has instructions,
                        and <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> normally is received
                        promptly here if he is bearing a message from Moscow. We believe it is in
                        our interest to continue that practice whenever practical. On balance,
                        therefore, we believe it desirable for you to receive <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> on Thursday, or possibly Friday.
                        The meeting could be very brief and very formal, limited to your receiving
                        and reading the <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> letter.</p>
                    <p>If you do receive <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>, we
                        recommend that he be told to use the C Street Diplomatic Entrance, as all
                        other ambassadors do. During a period of sensitive negotiations some years
                        ago, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> permitted
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> to drive into the
                        basement and use his private elevator, and this practice has been continued
                        ever since. As there is no sensitivity to your receiving him, and as our
                        Ambassador in Moscow has never enjoyed any comparable privilege, this would
                        seem to be an appropriate time to terminate the practice.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">OPTIONS</p>
                    <p>1. That you agree to receive <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>

                    <p>2. Summary: During Charge’s courtesy call January 20 on First Deputy Foreign
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>, latter commented
                        “unofficially” (but entirely predictably) on Soviet attitude toward
                        strategic arms control and complained that Secretary Muskie’s January 17
                            protest<note n="2" xml:id="d3fn2">A record of Muskie’s conversation with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> was transmitted in
                            telegram 13001 to Moscow, January 17. (Department of State, Central
                            Foreign Policy File, D810076–1089)</note> of Soviet media reports that
                        US was planning military intervention in Iran was an example of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> administration efforts to
                        inflame US public opinion by publicizing “artificial” issues. Charge made
                        clear that he was not empowered to speak for the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> administration, but countered
                            <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>’s contentions. Charge
                        stressed that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan remains a major issue in
                        US-Soviet relations <pb n="6" facs="0037" xml:id="pg_6"/>and that unfounded
                        and pernicious charges against the US in the Soviet press are a real issue
                        and raise serious questions regarding Soviet intentions. He also pointed out
                        that the Soviet Government cannot avoid responsibility for such articles on
                        the specious ground that Soviet press is not under its control. Despite the
                        contentious issues discussed and frank words exchanged, the meeting took
                        place in a calm and, indeed, cordial atmosphere. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. First Deputy Foreign Minister received the Charge January 20 for a
                        courtesy call. Following initial pleasantries, when Charge made it clear
                        that he was not authorized to speak for the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> administration and <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> suggested that entire conversation be considered
                        unofficial, <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> asked how
                        Charge viewed prospects for US-Soviet relations. Charge replied that he
                        believed <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> administration would
                        pursue a businesslike approach in dealing with the Soviet Union and would be
                        seriously interested in effective and reciprocal measures to control
                        strategic weapons. If agreements can be reached in the future, the strong
                        political position of the President and the new composition of the Senate
                        suggests that ratification should not be a serious problem. However, Charge
                        added, we must recognize that very serious problems exist in our
                        relationship which can only be alleviated by a change in Soviet policies and
                        practices. Noting the frequent Soviet criticism of US policy as lacking
                        steadiness and consistency, Charge remarked that without passing judgment on
                        these criticisms, he was confident that the Soviets would have no basis for
                        them under the incoming administration.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> responded by saying that
                        he took note of comment that if President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> signs an agreement it will be ratified, but asked
                        does that mean that the one already signed does not exist. Can a new
                        President ignore what has already been signed, what has been worked out
                        between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>? What was
                        signed between <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> was not in the personal interests
                        of the two men, but reflected the national interests of both countries.
                        These interests do not change on November 4, indeed they do not change every
                        three or four years. We can not seriously consider new agreements if the
                        past is any precedent.</p>
                    <p>5. Charge commented that the Soviets must clearly understand—since it is a
                        principle of international law and of the laws of both our countries—that a
                        treaty is not binding unless it is ratified. In Charge’s personal view the
                        final funeral of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II was the Soviet
                        invasion of Afghanistan. This remains a great problem in our relations and
                        prospects for an improvement in US-Soviet relations will be limited until
                        this problem is resolved. There are many people who attach a great deal of
                        importance to Afghanistan and it is difficult to exaggerate its influence
                        not only on American policies but on the American people <pb n="7" facs="0038" xml:id="pg_7"/>as a whole. Soviets must take into account US
                        point of view on this issue if they want to improve our bilateral
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> noted use of the word
                        invasion but did not make a major issue of it. He repeated that our
                        conversation was not official and proceeded to make the following
                        comments:</p>

                        was signed. Over one-half million U.S. soldiers were in Vietnam, bombs were
                        being dropped over North Vietnam. At that time we received in Moscow the
                        President of the U.S.A. and signed the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I Treaty. What was that? Foolishness on our part? No, we
                        looked into the future. The U.S. administration was also farsighted. The
                        documents are there. We also had a problem among our own people and the
                        question arose as to how we could receive Nixon when the events in Vietnam
                        were in the forefront of world attention. Public opinion must be considered,
                        but it also must be led. We speak now of Afghanistan, but what do you think?
                        Is <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II in the best interest of both
                        the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>? Do you really think
                        we need it more than you? After all, <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> said he wanted the treaty ratified, but that does not
                        seem to be the opinion of the new people and the new President’s closest
                        advisors. Everybody that has looked at that treaty closely has recognized
                        that it is in the interest of the U.S.</p>
                    <p>7. Charge told <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> that in his
                        opinion the situation in Vietnam in 1972 and the situation in Afghanistan
                        are not analogous. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>
                        interjected that he agreed fully that there was no comparison, but obviously
                        for different reasons than ours. Charge said that the Soviets must
                        understand the atmosphere in the U.S. as we on our part try to understand
                        the situation in the Soviet Union. As the Soviets say, facts remain
                        facts—namely, that the U.S. Senate will not ratify the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty as it stands. Furthermore, the
                        Soviet action in Afghanistan is considered an issue relevant to the question
                        of whether major US-Soviet agreements are desirable. That is a reality.
                        Also, in 1972 we signed the Declaration of Principles for US-Soviet
                            relations.<note n="3" xml:id="d3fn3">See <ref target="frus1969-76v14#d233">

                        Soviet actions in places such as Angola, Ethiopia, South Yemen, and, of
                        course, Afghanistan were inconsistent with obligations assumed in this
                        declaration.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> repeated that the
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> administration publicly
                        stated that <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II responded to U.S.
                        national interests and should be ratified despite Afghanistan. In the Soviet
                        view, the first blow to <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II was the
                        “Cuban brigade” story.<note n="4" xml:id="d3fn4">Reference is to the

                        but public opinion was influenced.</p>
                    <p>9. Charge pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>
                        that President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s public
                        statements make clear that his view of the merits of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II is not identical with that of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> administration.<note n="6" xml:id="d3fn6">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s statements during the 1980 Presidential

                            treaty.” (“<persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Urges Bar on
                            Arms Pact Unless Soviet Withdraws Troops,” <hi rend="italic">New York
                                Times</hi>, January 26, 1980, p. 10)</note> He added that in his
                        view this is not a rejection of the goal of arms control. It is clear,
                        however, that ratification of this agreement is simply not possible. The
                        Soviets must think of the future, not in terms of discarding everything in
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II but of negotiating a better
                        treaty. Charge then took the opportunity to ask <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> for his interpretation of Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s recent comments on
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II in the latest issue of
                        “Kommunist” (see Moscow 837).<note n="7" xml:id="d3fn7">In telegram 837 from
                            Moscow, January 20, the Embassy sent a summary of <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s article in <hi rend="italic">Kommunist</hi>. (Department of State, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            D810029–0647)</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> claimed that he had not
                        read the article, not even the excerpts that appeared in “<gloss target="#t_TASS_1">TASS</gloss>.” However, he said that the Soviet
                        leadership will not “recarve” (perekraivat’) <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. It is better to hold on to whatever you have in your
                        hand. The <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty was carefully
                        negotiated by two U.S. administrations and after all these years we still
                        don’t have an agreement in force. We go around in circles. It seems that
                        every time a new group comes into power, you throw everything away. I am not
                        optimistic that something better awaits us, he concluded.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> then picked up the
                        theme of American public opinion and complained about Secretary Muskie’s
                        strong protest to <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> on Soviet
                        media treatment of the U.S. hostages negotiations. He commented that public
                        opinion is not as objective a factor as the U.S. claims it is. In fact
                        public opinion is formed. For example, Muskie told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> the other day that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was trying to impede the hostage
                        negotiations and of the serious consequences of this. American public
                        opinion was not aware of this issue until the American leadership decided to
                        push its “imaginary” version of events to the forefront of public attention.
                        The American Embassy in Moscow and American journalists here seized on the
                        opportunity to highlight items in the Soviet media and press on this
                        subject. The Soviet side did not publicize the <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>/Muskie exchange and the Soviet press was silent on
                        this. The Soviet Embassy in Washington sent in its telegram on the subject
                            <pb n="9" facs="0040" xml:id="pg_9"/>and that was that. However,
                        Brzezinski seized the opportunity to defame the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as playing with the fate of the American hostages. What
                        purpose does it serve to incite hostile feelings toward the Soviet Union on
                        the part of the American public?</p>
                    <p>11. Charge responded that the issue was not fabricated by US but created by
                        Soviets. The allegations appearing in the Soviet press and media that the US
                        was preparing for a military attack or intervention in Iran were completely
                        baseless. Giving publicity to such reports when everyone knew that we were
                        at the final stages of negotiations on the hostage issue was particularly
                        serious. In Charge’s view, the Soviet action could only serve to elicit
                        negative and emotional reactions from the American public, since we know
                        that such allegations do not appear in the Soviet press by chance. It is
                        difficult to understand the purpose of these charges, unless they were aimed
                        at affecting our negotiations. Why did the Soviet Government go to such an
                        extreme? The U.S., the Soviet Union and all governments have a deep interest
                        in upholding the principle of diplomatic immunity, and this makes the Soviet
                        action all the more incomprehensible.</p>
                    <p>12. There followed a protracted exchange on the role of the Soviet press and
                        media with <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> reiterating the
                        Soviet line that we were making a very serious error in assuming that a
                        Soviet journalist represents official Soviet Government views and that any
                        commentary has the approval of the Soviet authorities on high. Charge
                        rebutted <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>’s argument in
                        categoric terms pointing out that <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> is the
                        official organ of the Central Committee of the <gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss>, that <hi rend="italic">Izvestiya</hi> is the official
                        organ of the Soviet Government, that the state controls the electronic
                        media. Naturally, in following Soviet policy we pay close attention to what
                        information the Soviet media select to highlight—as in this case concerning
                        the hostages. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> referred to
                        the initiative the Soviet Government had taken vis-a-vis Iran on behalf of
                        the hostages and asked how we could reconcile the Soviet Union’s official
                        position on this issue with recent U.S. accusations that the Soviet
                        Government sought to hinder the negotiations for the release of the
                        hostages. Charge repeated that we had to take seriously what the Soviets
                        write and say in their media, and that he was distressed that, even after
                        Secretary Muskie’s demarche to <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>, the Soviet media continued to peddle absurd and
                        potently unfounded allegations such as the charge that the U.S. somehow
                        instigated the Iraq-Iran conflict. Such actions place a heavy burden on
                        U.S.-Soviet relations. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>
                        brought the subject to a close by repeating lamely that we really make a
                        mistake in confusing Soviet journalism with official policy.</p>
                    <p>13. Comment: The conversation, which lasted 75 minutes and was conducted in
                        Russian, took place in an amicable personal atmosphere despite the sharp
                        content of the exchanges. We find nothing surprising <pb n="10" facs="0041" xml:id="pg_10"/>in the positions <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> took, all of which are standard fare, and all of
                        which we are likely to hear repeated in the future.</p>

                        would like to thank you for your message of congratulations on my
                        appointment as Secretary of State. I can assure you that I share your hopes
                        for strengthening the peace and that as Secretary I will work for the
                        development of relations between our two countries on the basis of restraint
                        and reciprocity.</p>
                    <p>If these goals are to be realized, I believe it is essential from the start
                        that our two governments fully comprehend each other’s concerns and
                        intentions. For this reason I would like in this initial correspondence to
                        address two issues which I consider of immediate importance.</p>
                    <p>The first deeply affects American opinion and thus the entire climate of our
                        relations. I refer to the treatment by the official Soviet media of events
                        surrounding the release by Iran of the 52 American diplomatic personnel
                        illegally held captive in Tehran for over a year. The attitude of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> throughout our efforts to deal with the
                        hostage crisis has already contributed to strains in our relations.
                        Continued distortion of the facts concerning the hostages and of our policy
                        toward <pb n="11" facs="0042" xml:id="pg_11"/>Iran can only raise further
                        doubts in this country concerning Soviet intentions.</p>
                    <p>The second is a matter of utmost potential seriousness—the situation in
                        Poland. I wish to make clear at the outset that there will be no change in
                        the US position of noninterference in Poland’s internal affairs. We are
                        prepared to do what we can to help Poland resolve its serious economic
                        difficulties. And we are convinced that, if left to themselves, the Poles
                        are fully capable of solving their problems themselves. Nor do I wish to
                        leave any doubt as to the seriousness with which the US would view efforts
                        by the Soviet Union to influence developments in Poland through military
                        pressure or direct intervention. This administration fully supports the
                        conclusions of the December 12 North Atlantic Council communique.<note n="2" xml:id="d4fn2">The text of the December 12, 1980, Final Communiqué of
                            the North Atlantic Council is printed in Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, February 1981, pp. 50–52. </note> Any
                        intervention in Poland would fundamentally alter the entire international
                        situation, and the US with its allies would be compelled to act in a manner
                        which the gravity of the situation would require.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Minister, I cannot in this initial letter address all of the issues
                        between us. At an appropriate time I would hope it would be possible to
                        exchange views on a wider range of subjects, particularly the problem of
                        Afghanistan, and the need for an early and complete Soviet withdrawal from
                        that country. The points I have raised are those which I believe deserve
                        immediate attention.</p>
                    <p>I would hope you would be prepared to address them in that spirit.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                    <p>The US–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> Understanding resulting from
                        the 1962 Cuban missile crisis consists of a Soviet undertaking not to
                        introduce “offensive weapons” into Cuba and a US pledge not to invade Cuba.
                        The Understanding applies to nuclear weapons and to missiles, bombers, and
                        other delivery systems capable of launching a strategic nuclear attack. In a
                        1970 clarification, the Soviets further agreed not to establish a naval base
                        or military/naval facility in Cuba.<note n="3" xml:id="d5fn3">Reference is
                            to <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s concern in
                            October 1970 that the Soviets were constructing a submarine base in
                            Cienfuegos and <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s
                            assurance that they would not. See <ref target="frus1969-76v12#d228">

                                Soviet Union, January 1969–October 1970, Document 228</ref>.</note>
                        This applies principally to the servicing in or from Cuba of submarines and
                        surface combatants capable of carrying nuclear weapons that can be used for
                        strategic attack and to facilities in Cuba for servicing such vessels.</p>
                    <p>The 1962 Understanding is subject to varying interpretations, because it was
                        never formalized in a single document subscribed to by both sides. Over the
                        years, the Soviets have persistently tested its limits. They have carried
                        out visits to Cuba of varying duration and using varying combinations of
                        naval task forces. They are assisting Cuba in constructing a naval facility
                        at Cienfuegos, the specific purpose of which is unclear, and have delivered
                        to Cuba increasingly sophisticated, but apparently non-nuclear weaponry,
                        most recently MIG–23 aircraft. The <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> Administration conducted a vigorous round of
                        diplomatic exchanges with the Soviets in the fall of 1979 on the issue of
                        the MIG–23’s. The Soviets asserted that the aircraft represented <pb n="13" facs="0044" xml:id="pg_13"/>only a modernization of earlier MIG
                        versions, denied that they were “offensive weapons,” and reaffirmed the
                        Soviet adherence to the 1962 Understanding.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Brigade</p>
                    <p>In August 1979, US intelligence confirmed the existence of a 2,600–3,000 man
                        combat unit in Cuba. Archival searches indicate that the unit, or precursor
                        elements, have been in Cuba since the early 1970’s and possibly as far back
                        as 1962. However, in recent years, our intelligence indicated, the Soviets
                        had upgraded the training and equipment of the brigade.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> publicly called the
                        unit’s presence “a matter of serious concern” and said that the United
                        States would not accept the maintenance of the “status quo” with respect to
                        the brigade. The Administration raised the matter privately with the
                        Soviets, who told the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> that the brigade
                        was “a training center,” assured us that the unit would not be enlarged or
                        given additional capabilities, and did not pose any threat to Cuba’s
                        neighbors.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> then informed the
                        American public of these Soviet assurances, and announced five measures to
                        firm up our posture in the region (increased surveillance of Cuba, assurance
                        that no Soviet unit in Cuba will be used to threaten US or Hemispheric
                        security, establishment of a Caribbean Task Force Headquarters in Key West,
                        expanded military maneuvers in the Caribbean, and increased economic
                        assistance for the region). The matter was then closed. The net effect was
                        that the US has, in fact, accepted the status quo with regard to the
                        brigade.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Assessment of the Understandings</p>
                    <p>The US–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> Understandings do not
                        specifically address the presence or level of Soviet ground forces in Cuba,
                        although some unilateral statements could be cited as relevant to Soviet
                        ground troops.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, we have basic reasons for putting down markers about the limits
                        of US tolerance over Soviet/Cuban activities staged in and from Cuba. The
                            <hi rend="italic">intent</hi> of the 1962 Understanding was to prevent
                        Cuba from becoming a threat to the security of the US—and to countries
                        friendly to us in the Hemisphere. It is this basic intent which needs to be
                        reasserted in light of Cuba’s military and subversive actions in recent
                        years, and Cuba’s increasingly close military collaboration with the Soviet
                        Union. The weakness of the <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>
                        Administration’s policy was that the US allowed the Soviets to exploit the
                        ambiguities in the Understandings, while not doing the same thing
                        ourselves.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Our Options</p>
                    <p>We could unilaterally, and without reference to any specific new Soviet or
                        Cuban activity, renounce the Understandings. Renunciation <pb n="14" facs="0045" xml:id="pg_14"/>would certainly lay down a clear marker to
                        the Soviets, Cubans and others, but we should weigh carefully both the
                        advantages and disadvantages of the terms of the Understandings. Also,
                        absent a clear Soviet or Cuban provocation, this action would give away an
                        important element of leverage in our overall relations with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>I recommend instead a new approach which seeks to use the Understandings to
                        advance US interests. The basic strategy would be to insist on a strict and
                        consistent interpretation of the Understandings, formulated and presented
                            <hi rend="italic">very clearly</hi> to the Soviets and Cubans and
                        leaving no doubt about the US reaction to any further testing of these
                        specific limits. Elements of this approach could include the following:</p>
                    <p>(1) A clear and firm presentation to the Soviets of the US intention,
                        beginning immediately, to oppose any Soviet actions in Cuba which we deem
                        inconsistent with our strict interpretation of the Understandings.</p>
                    <p>(2) An equally clear and frank presentation to the Soviets of the limits of
                        US tolerance over the growing Cuban and Soviet military/subversive
                        activities in this Hemisphere as well as in other regions, both within and
                        apart from the context of the Understandings.</p>
                    <p>(3) A clear message to the Soviets that breach of the above considerations
                        will prompt US denunciation of the Understandings and the taking of other
                        measures.</p>
                    <p>(4) An equally clear message to the Cubans about the limits of tolerance of
                        their adventurist activities in the Hemisphere and elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>In terms of <hi rend="italic">US-Soviet</hi> relations, maintenance of the
                        Understandings on a new basis of strict interpretation has the chief
                        advantage of sending a clear signal that the years of unresisted Soviet
                        probing are over; henceforth Soviet moves will incur prompt and demonstrable
                        costs.</p>
                    <p>In terms of <hi rend="italic">US-Allied/Hemispheric relations</hi>, the US
                        would be perceived by some as once again insisting on strict and fair
                        observance of international obligations incurred by other states,
                        particularly on the part of our adversary, the Soviet Union. Others would
                        see it as an effort by the new Administration to pick a fight.</p>
                    <p>In terms of <hi rend="italic">US-Cuban relations</hi>, Castro would be fully
                        aware that Cuban actions prejudicial to US security interests, in this
                        Hemisphere and elsewhere, will no longer go unpunished.</p>
                    <p>Finally, an approach based on maintenance of the Understandings <hi rend="italic">based on our strict interpretation</hi> provides us a form
                        of leverage over and linkage to Soviet behavior elsewhere, including those
                        strategic areas where Cubans are also acting as Soviet surrogates. In the
                        final analysis, a Soviet/Cuban breach of (a) our strict interpretation or
                        the Understandings and/or (b) Soviet actions elsewhere (e.g. Soviet
                        intervention in Poland), would then permit us to move <hi rend="italic">at
                            that point</hi> toward actual denunciation of the Understandings.</p>
                    <pb n="15" facs="0046" xml:id="pg_15"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                    <p>On balance, my current view is that maintaining the Understandings with
                        strict interpretation offers at least the possibility of giving the Soviets
                        pause before they exceed our limits and, equally, gives us a “hanging sword”
                        countermeasure to take when and as these limits are exceeded, in the
                        Caribbean or elsewhere. In any event, renunciation of the Understandings
                        should not be undertaken lightly since we would have to weigh all of the
                        consequences, including the absence of the present Understandings’
                        prohibition of the introduction of “offensive weapons”. This would require
                        careful attention in order not to recreate conditions similar to those of
                        the 1962 crisis.</p>
                    <p>In view of the importance of this matter, I would suggest that <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Cap Weinberger</persName> and I review the matter and

                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Moscow “Relaxed” About Relations with U.S.</hi>: [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] Aleksandr Bessmertnykh,
                        minister-counselor at the Soviet embassy in Washington, told a [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] source that Moscow
                        is “in a very relaxed mood over the new U.S. administration,” and though the
                        Kremlin expects there to be “some period of drift” in Washington’s policy
                        toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, the situation is not
                        “totally bad” for the time being. He added that within six months Moscow
                        expects the U.S. to take steps to improve relations. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> also commented that it will be
                        “extremely important” for the U.S. to overcome the <pb n="16" facs="0047" xml:id="pg_16"/>tendency of “paying too much attention to perceptions of
                        what is happening in Moscow . . . in contrast to the realities of the
                        situation,” and that “what is going on behind the scenes is more important
                        to Moscow than what is seen to be happening or is being said.” In
                        introducing the subject of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II
                        negotiations, the counselor mentioned that they could be a hindrance to

                        equality between the superpowers, in which case Moscow would be willing to
                        re-negotiate. (S)</p>

                    <p>On January 28, 1981, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Alexander Haig</persName> held his first news conference since his
                        confirmation. “I think it’s clear that we have been witnessing an
                        unprecedented—at least character and scope—risk-taking mode on the part of
                        the Soviet Union, not just in this hemisphere but in Africa as well,” he
                        stated. “We have seen in that process the exploitation of the Cuban proxy,
                        and I can assure you that this is the subject of utmost concern to this
                        Administration, it is a subject which will be high on the priority of our
                        national security and foreign policy agenda. I would suggest also that an
                        additional subject related intimately to this, in the conduct of Soviet
                        activity and in terms of training, funding, and equipping, is international
                        terrorism.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, February

                    <p>On January 29, President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Ronald
                            Reagan</persName> held his first Presidential news conference. Sam
                        Donaldson of American Broadcasting Company News asked: “Mr. President, what
                        do you see as the long-range intentions of the Soviet Union? Do you think,
                        for instance, the Kremlin is bent on world domination that might lead to a
                        continuation of the cold war, or do you think that under other circumstances
                        détente is possible?” <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                        responded: “Well, so far détente’s been a one-way street that the Soviet
                        Union has used to pursue its own aims. I don’t have to think of an answer as
                        to what I think their intentions are; they have repeated it. I know of no
                        leader of the Soviet Union since the revolution, and including the present
                        leadership, that has not more than once repeated in the various Communist
                        congresses they hold their determination that their goal must be the
                        promotion of world revolution and a one-world Socialist or Communist state,
                        whichever word you want to use. Now, as long as they do that and as long as
                        they, at the same time, have openly and publicly declared that the only <pb n="17" facs="0048" xml:id="pg_17"/>morality they recognize is what will
                        further their cause, meaning they reserve unto themselves the right to
                        commit any crime, to lie, to cheat, in order to attain that, and that is
                        moral, not immoral, and we operate on a different set of standards, I think
                        when you do business with them, even at a détente, you keep that in mind.”

                    </list>
                    <p>Your 1730 meeting today with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> raises the more general point of how this
                        Administration will conduct relations with the Soviet Union. We would like
                        to share some brief thoughts with you:</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>—As you know, their man in Washington has become a, if not <hi rend="italic">the</hi>, key conduit for our communications with
                            Moscow.</p>
                        <p>—Not only does it tend to undermine the position of our embassy and
                            officials stationed in Moscow, but it allows the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to control the circuit.</p>
                        <p>—This tends as well to give them more access to us than vice-versa, a
                            pattern which only exacerbates an imbalance already there owing to the
                            fact that our society is so much more open than theirs.</p>
               </quote>
                    <p>Given this background, we would suggest that you make it clear from the
                        outset that <hi rend="italic">under your tenure US-Soviet relations will be
                            conducted on the basis of strict reciprocity in form as well as
                            substance</hi>. The Soviets should be made to understand not only that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> will no longer enjoy
                        special status, but also that whatever status he does enjoy will depend upon
                        equal treatment for his opposite number in Moscow. Such a point could be
                        underlined by your declining any future meetings <pb n="18" facs="0049" xml:id="pg_18"/>with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        until our Ambassador has had his first session of comparable duration and
                            seriousness.<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2">NOTE: It should be made clear to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that we do not
                            expect reciprocity until we have an Ambassador of our own in Moscow. The
                            caveat on future meetings with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> might therefore not arise for a little while.
                            But <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is the right occasion to make the point.
                            [Footnote is in the original.]</note>
               </p>
                    <p>There is another consideration as well. We question whether, over the
                        long-term, it is wise to have <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> remain in Washington. His position as dean of the
                        diplomatic corps affords him a status which is unfortunate from our
                        perspective. His contacts are all too broad and well-established.</p>
                    <p>In short, it is difficult to see how we benefit from having this often
                        devious and always dangerous diplomat accredited to Washington. Getting him
                        replaced in the next year or two should be a serious goal for us. By
                        demonstrating to his masters that he no longer will enjoy special treatment
                        or status, we may be taking an important first step to bring about his
                            removal.<note n="3" xml:id="d8fn3">In telegram 602 from Moscow, January

                        priority issues but complained that those I had raised—the hostages <pb n="19" facs="0050" xml:id="pg_19"/>in Iran, Poland, and Afghanistan—did
                        not fall within that category.<note n="3" xml:id="d9fn3">See <ref target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.</note> On Iran, he justified the
                        Soviet record by pointing to Moscow’s support for international law—for
                        which, he complained, we had never said a “kind word.” His remarks on Poland
                        were rather sharp. He accused the US and other Western powers of attempting
                        to influence the Polish situation; he declared that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> and other American radio broadcasts constituted open
                        interference in Polish internal affairs; he implied that Western
                        interference was not limited only to radio broadcasts. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s remarks on Afghanistan followed
                        the familiar Soviet line. The US, he said, could contribute to a political
                        settlement by facilitating the opening of a dialogue between Pakistan and
                        Afghanistan.</p>

                        Furthermore, he was told that events since the early ’70’s—in Africa, Cuba,
                        Afghanistan—have caused great difficulties for us and that you were elected
                        by the American people to speak out on these matters. It will be necessary
                        for us to move toward greater reciprocity in our relations. I referred

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Cuba as a Factor in the US-Soviet Regional
                        Relationship</p>
                    <p>Cuba has been a sore spot in the US-Soviet relationship since the 1962
                        missile crisis, which delineated Soviet military frontiers there and laid
                        the foundations for a future Soviet Caribbean presence. Soviet relations
                        with Cuba in the interim have become something of an anomaly. Moscow is
                        committed to keeping a communist regime in Cuba, and to this end it broadly
                        underwrites Castro economically and militarily, but it remains ambiguous
                        about the nature and extent of its commitment to Cuba’s military security.
                        In this ambiguity, and the ways in <pb n="21" facs="0052" xml:id="pg_21"/>which the Soviets maintain it, lies the source of greatest ongoing concern
                        to US policy.</p>
                    <p>Upwards of 6,000 Soviet military personnel may now be in Cuba: military
                        advisors, technical personnel, and a Soviet brigade. With the resolution of
                        the 1962 missile crisis, in which the Soviets agreed to dismantle offensive
                        (i.e., nuclear) weapons bases and systems in return for a conditional
                        assurance by the US not to invade, the issue of Soviet troops in Cuba
                        temporarily subsided. But the issue of the use of Cuba to enhance Soviet
                        strategic capabilities repeatedly has arisen since then: e.g., in 1970, with
                        the start of construction of a facility that appeared to support Soviet
                        nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines; in 1978, with the delivery to
                        Cuba of MiG–23 aircraft that are potentially nuclear-capable; and in 1979,
                        with the identification of the Soviet brigade.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have also projected their military presence into the region in
                        other ways: there have been 20 deployments of Soviet naval vessels to the
                        Caribbean since 1969, 19 of them stopping in Cuba; TU–95 reconnaissance
                        aircraft have been deployed to Cuba to collect intelligence on US naval
                        operations along the Atlantic coast.<note n="6" xml:id="d10fn6">

               </p>
                    <p>With the souring of US-Soviet relations in recent years, Moscow no longer saw
                        prospects for a normalization of US-Cuban relations, as it did in the
                        mid-1970s. If the outlook should become more favorable, it would undoubtedly
                        back Cuban demands for the end of the economic blockade and of US air
                        surveillance of Cuba and a return of Guantanamo. The Soviets are interested
                        in US-Cuban normalization partly as a means of lessening, however slightly,
                        their economic burden in Cuba and also of enhancing Cuba’s international
                        image, but they might also fear the consequences for their political ties
                        with Havana of an increased US presence. Furthermore, the Soviets may
                        believe they have some leverage in Cuba that could be usefully exploited
                        against the US: <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> implied last

                        of direct Soviet military aid. Through Cuba, however, and possibly through
                        other channels, the Soviets in the last several years have given aid<note n="8" xml:id="d10fn8">

                        other <pb n="22" facs="0053" xml:id="pg_22"/>Central American insurgencies.
                        Both Cuba and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> want to foster
                        revolutionary change in the region, and it is likely that the Soviets at
                        least acquiesce in Cuban inputs of materiel. At the same time, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is careful to avoid open identification
                        with Cuban military assistance efforts.</p>
                    <p>Moscow’s general line toward guerrilla movements in Central America, which it
                        sees as the wave of the future, is one of encouraging leftist groups in each
                        country to unite as a means of mounting effective opposition to existing
                        rightist regimes. In backing local communists and other leftists, it has
                        implicitly endorsed the belief of these groups that violence is their only
                        road to power. Moscow may anticipate that some of the communist parties
                        eventually will play key roles, but at this stage, it does not insist that
                        communists be at the forefront of these coalition movements. In some
                        instances—Nicaragua, for example—it has avoided identification with local
                        communists and has fully backed the new leadership in the expectation that
                        its political course will veer steadily leftward.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the Soviets have expanded the web of official relationships
                        established with Nicaragua’s ruling FSLN junta last spring when several
                        cooperation agreements (economic, planning, agricultural,
                        cultural/educational, party ties, etc.) were signed in Moscow. They have
                        established contacts with Nicaraguan trade unions, signed a radio/TV
                        agreement and begun<note n="9" xml:id="d10fn9">

                        the feasibility of a major hydroelectric project. They have also established
                        a direct air link with Managua.</p>
                    <p>In El Salvador, the Soviets may well have supported the formation of the
                        United Revolutionary Directorate (DRU), the umbrella organization that
                        directs the insurgency. If the ruling junta were to decide to accommodate
                        the left, however, Moscow probably would encourage the DRU to cooperate in
                        the expectation that the left would emerge as the main political force.<note n="10" xml:id="d10fn10">

                    <p>Moscow rates the leftist configuration in Guatemala as in a politically
                        immature stage, but it may in the future see exploitable opportunities if
                        the leftist groups are able to rally behind a single leadership as they have
                        in El Salvador. Moscow probably has similar, though more distant, hopes for
                        the leftists in Honduras.</p>

                        the Soviets. As it was, they did not want to underwrite a regime which,
                        however friendly, had been unable to attract enough economic assistance from
                        noncommunist sources to sustain itself. (The Soviets had made clear that
                        they would not take on the Jamaican burden even to further the Marxist
                        cause.) In Grenada, the East Europeans have joined the Soviets in supplying
                        a modicum of economic and other forms of assistance to bolster the Marxists,
                        but the Soviets are likely to doubt the viability of the regime.</p>
                    <p>Moscow has made overtures to the government-controlled labor movement in
                        Guyana, and it tries to cultivate the Burnham regime even at the expense of
                        the local communists whenever the prospects look promising. Its main avenue
                        of penetration in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, given the lack of an
                        official Soviet presence, is to work covertly with local communist parties
                        against the pro-US regimes. Moscow limits itself to financial subsidies and
                        tactical advice, but these activities include supporting the resort to
                        violence by the local parties.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Extension of Soviet Influence by Other Means</p>
                    <p>Moscow is actively pursuing cooperation in the economic, technical, cultural,
                        and other spheres. With the exception of Cuba, however, it generally has
                        been unwilling to make long-term, costly commitments of economic aid to
                        underwrite new clients. Its economic and technical assistance has been
                        limited to a few countries (Costa Rica, Mexico, Nicaragua, and to some
                        extent, Guyana and earlier, Jamaica). Domestic Soviet economic stringencies
                        and the traditional reluctance of most countries of the region to become
                        closely associated with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> have been
                        restraining factors.</p>
                    <p>Soviet aid might be more attractive in the future as these countries attempt
                        to assert greater independence vis-a-vis the US and their other traditional
                        Western suppliers of arms and economic assistance, but whether the Soviets
                        will become more generous is questionable. In other spheres, such as
                        educational and cultural cooperation, the Soviets prefer a slow but steady
                        expansion which is intended to lay the basis for closer political ties.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Implications for US Interests</p>
                    <p>The growth of Soviet ties with these countries tends to complicate US
                        relations with them. Some states, for example, may have second thoughts
                        about supporting the US on political issues of marginal or secondary
                        interest to them (e.g., denial measures on Afghanistan) if they believe
                        trade and aid opportunities with the Soviet Union would <pb n="24" facs="0055" xml:id="pg_24"/>be jeopardized. Substantial Soviet economic
                        and technical assistance, linked to political and military objectives, could
                        thus create new challenges to US interests in the region.</p>
                    <p>Moscow is well aware of US sensitivities, but it will not abandon the gradual
                        buildup and intensification of its own activities in the region. Still it
                        probably will continue to avoid provocative initiatives that could
                        complicate its dealings with Washington, especially when it is attempting to
                        shape a relationship with the new Administration.</p>
                    <p>In extending military assistance to Central American insurgencies, the
                        Soviets will use indirect channels to minimize the risk of provoking the US.
                        While this assistance apparently is on a small scale, it could eventually go
                        beyond the transfer of light arms and involve military advisors and more
                        sophisticated equipment. In Nicaragua, for example, the Soviets might be
                        tempted to send military advisors, perhaps in return for access privileges
                        for Soviet naval forces, but they would test each step carefully for the US
                        reaction before proceeding to the next.<note n="12" xml:id="d10fn12">

                    <pb n="25" facs="0056" xml:id="pg_25"/>
                    <p>3. Begin text:</p>
                    <p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                    <p>I have carefully studied your letter of January 24 transmitted through the US
                        Embassy in Moscow and take note of the wish expressed therein to work for
                        development of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.
                        This corresponds to our intentions too.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, there exists quite a number of questions in Soviet-American
                        relations, including the ones which deserve priority attention and on which
                        it would be advisable to exchange views. It can only be regretted that such
                        questions, judging by your letter, have not yet fallen within the field of
                        vision of the new administration.</p>
                    <p>As to certain specific questions touched upon in your letter I would like to
                        say the following. Right after the incident when the US Embassy personnel
                        were seized in Tehran, the Soviet Union in clear and unambiguous terms came
                        out against actions of that type, in favor of the strict observance of the
                        Vienna Convention provisions concerning respect for diplomatic immunity and,
                        accordingly, in favor of the immediate release of the detainees. This was
                        also the position we adhered to during the discussion of this question in
                        the U.N. Security Council at the end of 1979 as well as in the following
                        period. The U.S. Government is also fully aware of the fact that it was from
                        these same positions that we addressed ourselves directly to the Iranian
                        leadership.</p>
                    <p>This, however, is now passed over in silence. Neither your letter nor the
                        public statements of representatives of the administration contain a single
                        kind word addressed to the Soviet Union in connection with the position it
                        adopted. Instead, clearly tendentious assessments are being given to what
                        was reported in the Soviet news media in connection with the release of the
                        American diplomats. Moreover, this is being done in such a way as to
                        entirely distort in the eyes of public opinion the position held by the
                        Soviet state on this matter. One cannot help asking the question of why all
                        this is being done and whether any thought is being given as to how we
                        should regard such distorted interpretations.</p>
                    <p>Now about Poland. First of all I must say in a totally definite way that the
                        internal affairs of this sovereign socialist state cannot be a subject of
                        discussion between third countries, including between the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>. If one is to speak, however, of outside attempts to exert
                        influence on the internal situation in Poland, then it is necessary to state
                        that such attempts do in fact take place and that they are being undertaken
                        precisely on the part of the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> and other
                        Western powers. In this regard it is sufficient to mention at least the
                        provocative and instigatory transmissions of the “Voice of America” and
                        other US Government controlled radio stations broadcasting to Poland.
                        Constituting open interference in the internal affairs of Poland, those
                        broadcasts are, <pb n="26" facs="0057" xml:id="pg_26"/>in addition, aimed at
                        arousing among the Polish population unfriendly sentiments with regard to
                        the Soviet Union. There are also facts which indicate that the interference
                        of Western powers in Polish affairs is not limited to radio broadcasts
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>Here again a question arises: What purpose then is being served by the
                        attempts of the American side to introduce the “Polish theme” into the
                        Soviet-American dialogue and to make at the same time inappropriate
                        “warnings” addressed to the Soviet Union?</p>
                    <p>As far as Poland is concerned we, for our part, are guided by the provisions
                        of the joint statement—which, I believe, you are familiar with—adopted at
                        the beginning of last December in Moscow at the meeting of the leaders of
                        the Warsaw Treaty states.<note n="5" xml:id="d11fn5">Reference is to the
                            closing statement of a Warsaw Pact summit held in Moscow that concluded
                            on December 5, 1980. In telegram 19286 from Moscow, December 5, 1980,
                                <persName corresp="#p_WT_1">Watson</persName> reported to Washington
                            that “judging from the communique issued this evening the Warsaw Pact
                            summit was called to pressure the Kania regime into a firmer stand and
                            to make clear that ‛fraternal assistance’ is standing in the wings. Thus
                            the threat of outside military intervention seems abated for the
                            moment.” (Department of State, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            D800581–0422)</note> This document spells out the collective position of
                        the Warsaw Treaty countries, including the Polish People’s Republic itself,
                        whose leaders participated in that meeting.</p>
                    <p>Since you, Mr. Secretary, did not bypass in your letter the Afghanistan
                        aspect either, I would like to present briefly our position in this respect.
                        Its essence is that there must be a cessation of the armed incursions into
                        the territory of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and of all other
                        interference in its internal affairs, and firm guarantees must be given that
                        this will not be resumed. Doing so would also eliminate the reasons that
                        brought forth the necessity of introducing into Afghanistan a limited
                        contingent of Soviet troops at the request of the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> Government in accordance with the existing norms of
                        international law.</p>
                    <p>Concrete paths leading to the achievement of a political settlement of the
                        situation around Afghanistan were set forth in the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> Government statement of May 14, 1980. Later, on more than
                        one occasion, including quite recently, the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> Government has confirmed its readiness to start working on
                        the appropriate agreements between Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as
                        between Afghanistan and Iran. The United States for its part could, no
                        doubt, contribute to the cause of a political settlement if it were to
                        facilitate the beginning of a dialogue between Afghanistan and Pakistan and
                        did not attempt, as is the case now, to raise obstacles thereto.</p>
                    <pb n="27" facs="0058" xml:id="pg_27"/>
                    <p>In conclusion I would like once more to confirm our readiness for an exchange
                        of views on a wide range of issues. I hope that subsequently in our exchange
                        of views a proper place will be accorded to the questions on the resolution
                        of which depend, in the first instance, the prospects for the development
                        both of Soviet-American relations and of the international situation as a
                        whole.</p>

                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> on January 29,
                        Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        expressed readiness to exchange views on matters deserving priority
                        attention but complained that those the Secretary had raised—Soviet
                        treatment of the hostage situation, Poland, and Afghanistan—did not fall
                        within that category. On Iran, he sought to justify the Soviet record on
                        support for international law—for which we had never said a “kind word.” He
                        accused the US and other Western powers of attempting to influence the
                        Polish situation, specifically referring to broadcasts by <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> and other <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>-controlled radios as constituting open interference in
                        Polish internal affairs and implying that Western interference was not
                        limited to radio broadcasts alone. His remarks on Afghanistan followed the
                        standard Soviet position. <pb n="28" facs="0059" xml:id="pg_28"/>The US, he
                        said, could contribute to a political settlement by facilitating the
                        beginning of a dialogue between Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>—The Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> he would
                        study the letter before commenting on it. In responding to complaints by
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> on the tone being set by
                        the new administration, the Secretary pointed out that the President was
                        reflecting the mood of the American people and addressing the issues which
                        greatly concerned them. He emphasized our insistence on reciprocity in
                        US-Soviet relations and on change in the pattern of Soviet conduct which was
                        at the root of the difficulties in our relationship. The Secretary also
                        expressed great concern over the most recent developments in Poland and
                        stressed that the situation was one the Polish people must resolve for
                        themselves. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. Before handing over the <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        letter, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> initiated a general
                        discussion on the state of US-Soviet relations, noting that there was a “new
                        beginning” for him (conceivably an allusion to the fact that he had been
                        asked to enter the Department by the front door rather than through the
                        basement garage).<note n="5" xml:id="d12fn5">See <ref target="#d2">Document
                                2</ref>.</note> From events of the first week, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> continued, it appeared that the
                        new administration was starting down the same road as the <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> administration, at least on two
                        matters. The last administration had begun by emphasizing human rights—“and
                        you know where we ended up on that”—and by setting aside work on a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> Treaty which had practically been
                        completed. Four years later, we were back almost at the same place, with
                        references to human rights and, again, with questioning of all that had been
                        done on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. He sincerely hoped that the
                        way this week had gone was not indicative of the future course of events.
                        The President’s statements in his just-concluded press conference would
                        cause puzzlement in Moscow, and he wondered how he should explain them.<note n="6" xml:id="d12fn6">See <ref target="#d7">Document 7</ref>.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>4. The Secretary responded that we had experienced a long period of
                        difficulty in our relations. Perhaps in the early ’70s we were beginning a
                        process of understanding, with potential benefit for world stability. Events
                        since then—in Africa; Cuban activity—which could only be described as basic
                        interventionism with no other purpose than to destabilize regimes and affect
                        the free choice of peoples were responsible for the difficulties we were
                        experiencing. As for <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s
                        comparison with the beginning of the previous administration, the Secretary
                        noted that one basic difference was the feeling of the American people, of
                        which administration policy was a reflection. Among other things, feelings
                        engendered by the Vietnam era had passed. It was clear that <pb n="29" facs="0060" xml:id="pg_29"/>it would be necessary for us to establish
                        greater reciprocity in our relations. The Secretary noted that we had been
                        disturbed by the outpourings of the Soviet press in recent weeks. We were
                        profoundly disturbed by Cuban actions in this hemisphere and elsewhere. Our
                        attitudes were going to be different from now on—and this would serve the
                        interest of world peace.</p>
                    <p>5. Turning to the Polish situation, the Secretary said that both he and the
                        President were greatly concerned by the news that afternoon from Poland.
                        While he recognized that what was happening in Poland might create anguish
                        for the Soviet Union, he emphasized that the situation was one which must be
                        worked out by the Polish people alone. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he was unaware of anything special that had
                        happened in Poland that day and thought the news in the American press that
                        there were to be discussions in Warsaw on Friday<note n="7" xml:id="d12fn7">January 30.</note> represented a hopeful sign. The Secretary said he
                        hoped that was the case but considered the most recent pronouncements by the
                        Polish regime very threatening.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> returned to his criticism
                        of the tack taken by the new administration, particularly by the Secretary
                        and the President in their first press conferences. He personally had not
                        expected them to issue very “unfriendly” statements concerning his country
                        and felt that they were not helpful. Responses from Moscow would be
                        inevitable. A quiet dialogue aimed at determining the respective positions
                        of the two sides and deciding what was to be done would be much more helpful
                        than an exchange of press conference statements.</p>
                    <p>7. The Secretary responded that mature states understood that we should not
                        enter into mutually escalated public relations wars. While he wished it were
                        unnecessary to indulge in statements of the sort to which <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> had referred, the American people
                        were profoundly disturbed by events and had put Pres. <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> in the White House to deal with the
                        issues he had discussed in his press conference.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> then gave the Secretary
                        the <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> letter (text reported
                            <gloss target="#t_septel_1">septel</gloss>). After reading it, the
                        Secretary said he would study it before responding.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked how the Secretary
                        thought we should proceed in developing a dialogue. Should we continue to
                        engage in an exchange of public statements? The Secretary responded that the
                        Department would be undertaking a review of number of issues, and that upon
                        completion of this review he would discuss with the President how he wished
                        to proceed. He thought it likely that he would be communicating with
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, regularly, and frankly.
                        We would be getting <pb n="30" facs="0061" xml:id="pg_30"/>a new Ambassador
                        in place in Moscow and the senior staff in the Department. And while he was
                        not interested in getting into an exchange of public statements he had been,
                        as <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> knew, outspoken on these
                        matters for many years because he had seen a growing danger. He was not a
                        harborer [of] devil theories and took a very pragmatic approach. But he had
                        witnessed Ethiopia, Afghanistan and recent events in our own hemisphere.
                        There simply had to be a reversal, a shift, a change, because issues of
                        international stability were involved. It was not acceptable just to talk
                        peace while acting differently. To <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s comment that this was a two-sided story, the
                        Secretary observed that over the past four years it had been very one-sided
                        from his point of view.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> stated there was no lack
                        of desire on the Soviet side to have very frank and blunt discussions. One
                        point on which we would never be able to agree, the Secretary interjected,
                        was the remark which <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had
                        made to President <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> at Vienna
                        concerning wars of liberation—which as reported to him was that the Soviet
                        Union would continue to support such wars even in spheres of interest to the
                            U.S.<note n="8" xml:id="d12fn8">For memoranda of conversations from

                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that he did not recall
                        such a remark, though he was present during the Vienna discussions.</p>
                    <p>11. The Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> he
                        should know that the President entered office very concerned about the state
                        of our relations. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> would
                        learn that the President said what he meant—and he hoped <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> would find what he said
                        constructive. Asked whether the President’s press conference remarks should
                        be considered constructive, the Secretary said that they should be
                        considered an objective assessment of recent events. In refuting Soviet
                        rationalization of their press play on Iran at a time when the lives of our
                        hostages were at stake, the Secretary said he knew enough about the Soviet
                        press to know that few things which appeared in it were accidental.</p>
                    <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked the Secretary to
                        put himself in the shoes of the Soviets and consider how the Politburo would
                        see the new administration on the basis of the statements made thus far by
                        the Secretary and the President. Those statements, the Secretary rejoined,
                        would give the Soviet leadership a wonderful agenda for factual denial.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> argued that there was a
                        danger that both sides would come to wrong conclusions; without elaborating,
                        he also suggested that this was a particularly difficult time, when the
                        Soviet leadership was preparing for the Party Congress.</p>
                    <pb n="31" facs="0062" xml:id="pg_31"/>
                    <p>13. When the Secretary referred once more to our insistence on reciprocity,
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> commented that the
                        Secretary had also earlier mentioned “restraint,” and that that part of his
                        statement he had liked. In an aside, which he asked not be put on the
                        record, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that the task
                        for the Secretary was relatively easy, for he only had one leader to
                        persuade—the President—whereas in the Soviet case the whole Politburo had to
                        be convinced. It was difficult to convince them of anything in the first
                        place, but once their minds were made up, it was even harder to change them.
                        It would be unfortunate if their initial impression was that the U.S. now
                        had a hostile administration, for that might be a lasting impression.</p>
                    <p>14. The Secretary responded that “hostile” was the worst label that might be
                        applied. More appropriate might be offended, confident, determined, prepared
                        to do what was necessary. The Soviet leadership must know that there must be
                        change in the areas that he had cited, for the future good of both
                        sides.</p>

                    <p>I believe your draft includes all of the regional and functional components
                        essential to a comprehensive study of East-West relations.<note n="2" xml:id="d13fn2">Printed as an attachment.</note> My only reservation
                        concerns what I believe to be a need to establish the philosophical
                        contextual setting in which the study will take place. <pb n="32" facs="0063" xml:id="pg_32"/>As you know, military studies always begin
                        by defining “the threat.” I believe we should use another term but that (the
                        threat) is what I’m trying to get at in calling for a contextual
                        setting.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, what is our assessment of the Soviet Union’s goals—its
                        geopolitical objectives and long-term game plan? In other words, what do we
                        believe are the dimensions of the problem we must deal with in the
                        near-midterm period? This section need not be terribly long but I believe
                        that in some study at the outset of this Administration we must say what we
                        believe about the enduring purposes and objectives of the Soviet Union. I
                        recall Sam Huntington’s piece in connection with <gloss target="#t_PRM_1">PRM</gloss>–10<note n="3" xml:id="d13fn3">Reference is to the
                            comprehensive net assessment led by Samuel Huntington, a consultant to
                            the National Security Council, during the first several months of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> administration.
                            Documentation pertaining to <gloss target="#t_PRM_1">PRM</gloss>–10 is
                            scheduled for publication in <ref target="frus1977-80v04">
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1977–1980, vol. IV,
                                National Security Policy</ref>.</note> which did (whether one agrees
                        with it or not) provide one man’s contextual setting.</p>
                    <p>From that broad overview, each of your component pieces flows logically; that
                        is, after we state our fundamental beliefs about their long-term intentions,
                        we can consider how their ability to carry out those intentions are affected
                        by the “Soviet internal scene” today, “US-Soviet bilateral relations” and
                        other dimensions of our relationship world-wide.</p>
                    <p>Again, with apologies for my military methodology, I would tend to follow
                        this threat section with an overview of our present resources for coping
                        with it in a very broad sense. For example, what is the state of our
                        alliances? Do we all hold a common perception of the threat? What is the
                        state of the military balance across the force spectrum? What is the state
                        of the economic balance? This amounts to a “net assessment.” Once you have
                        done that, you will have identified political, economic, and military
                        shortfalls (or surpluses). This leads to an identification of your
                        vulnerabilities. For example, I believe we would both focus on our
                        vulnerability to economic disruption arising from Soviet capabilities to
                        exercise prevailing influence over Persian Gulf resources. If that is true,
                        the study would need to treat—as you propose in paragraph 3—how we restore
                        effective deterrence in the Persian Gulf area. Related analysis would also
                        focus on how we restore free world political strength in that area.</p>
                    <p>All of the above need not alter your fundamental approach. I express it only
                        to confirm that we both view the scope of the study along the same lines,
                        generally.</p>

                        Assess state of Soviet economy, including dependencies that could be
                        exploited or could lead Moscow toward foreign adventures. Discuss Soviet

                        into substance of our relations? Discuss the status of established bilateral
                        cooperative arrangements and describe those that are advantageous to us and
                        of real interest to Moscow. What policies can we follow now that will lead

                        possible US reprisals for Soviet invasion, likely allied reactions and

                        export credit policies toward <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Assess
                        in broad terms how we can use economic and security assistance to support US
                        competition with <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>5—<hi rend="italic">US/Soviet Competition in Developing World</hi>. Discuss
                        how we can counter the political-military influence of Moscow and Soviet
                        client regimes (including Cuba, Libya, <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>, Ethiopia, Angola and Syria) and how we can exploit their
                        vulnerabilities. Identify potential Soviet “targets of opportunity” in next
                        year and how to cope with such dangers. Consider what can be done to
                        undercut Vietnamese control of Kampuchea and support Thailand and <gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss> states. Identify possible US
                        surrogates with which we can cooperate in Third Countries (eg, Morocco in
                        Africa). This analysis should take account of indigenous forces of

                    <p>6—<hi rend="italic">Core Alliance Partners</hi>. Discuss how we can generate
                        European and Japanese cooperation in containing Soviet expansionism in

                            (eg—<gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>) and how to gain their support.
                        In this connection, analyze the “division of labor” concept and how it might
                        be applied to political, economic and security areas, taking account of
                        distinctive roles of Europeans and Japan. How can we ensure that allies
                        blame <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> rather than US if East-West
                        relations turn colder.</p>
                    <p>7—<hi rend="italic">China</hi>. Analyze US interests in the
                        Sino-Soviet-American triangular relationship and how to manage these
                        relationships to our advantage. Discuss how Sino-American cooperation can
                        limit Soviet expansion, including diplomatic and military consultations,
                        intelligence sharing and parallel approaches toward Kampuchea and other
                        international issues. How does arms supply issue fit into this picture.
                        Indicate how Chinese relationships with Japan and Europeans might serve
                        these goals.</p>

                    <p>8—<hi rend="italic">Eastern Europe</hi>. Review the degrees of internal
                        liberalization and external independence of the East European states and
                        discuss options for promoting the gradual development of those two trends in
                        cooperation with our key allies. Analyze how we can exploit endemic East
                        European economic problems to enhance our influence and their freedom of
                        action vis-a-vis Moscow, especially as the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is increasingly unable to bail them out. Discuss how these
                        goals can be furthered in the short-term and longer-term without provoking
                        internal political convulsions and Soviet interventions.</p>
                    <p>9—<hi rend="italic">Political Competition</hi>. Discuss strategy for

                        developing world. Describe options for public affairs diplomacy (including
                        ICA/VOA), ways to counter Soviet “peace offensive” in allied countries and
                        methods for highlighting Soviet interventions and the weak Soviet foreign
                        assistance record in LDCs. Discuss possibilities for cooperation with allied
                        and friendly countries.</p>

                  <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> on the latter’s statement concerning the <gloss target="#t_ERW_1">ERW</gloss> question.<note n="2" xml:id="d14fn2">Reference is to the enhanced radiation weapon (neutron bomb). See

                        earlier this week only represented his statements in full.<note n="3" xml:id="d14fn3">Reference is to telegram 28412 to all <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> capitals, February 4. (Department of

                        that the State Department would deny the story (this was done by <persName corresp="#p_DW_1">Bill Dyess</persName> at the noon briefing today) and
                        that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> would be
                        given a copy of the cable that was sent out. <persName corresp="#p_WFJ_1">Bing West</persName> subsequently received a copy of the cable.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> then discussed his
                        dinner meeting last night with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> and Senator <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> said that he told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that the Soviets were not living up to the “code of
                        international conduct” layed down in earlier agreements between Moscow and
                        Washington. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> also put
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> on alert about the
                        Administration’s concerns over Soviet arms shipments and the use of proxies
                        in Latin America, Africa, and other regions. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>, in turn, complained about the President’s and
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s remarks concerning
                        the Soviet Union in their recent press conferences.<note n="4" xml:id="d14fn4">See <ref target="#d7">Document 7</ref>.</note> Senator

                        III negotiations, was unable to make much headway in the conversation.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> then said that
                        it would be a mistake for the Administration to open talks with the Soviets
                        on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>, and other arms control negotiations. Deputy Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> raised the issue of the
                        MX and noted that the State Department would soon have to decide on whether
                        it was a good idea to build the system to ease the verification problem, a
                        step that could add an additional $1.5 billion to the cost of the
                        system.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>, returning to his
                        discussion with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>, said that
                        the Soviet Ambassador told him that Moscow wants a “non-aligned”
                        Afghanistan. On Poland, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s remarks indicated that the Russians are ready to
                        move at any time. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> indicated
                        that from the Russian perspective, the situation is getting worse. “We are
                        going to do what we have to do,” <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> told Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> while Senator <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> was out of the room. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> added that the State Department was
                        in the process of putting together a detailed checklist on Western responses

                  <hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> Interagency groups are reviewing the
                        items on today’s agenda. Their work is not complete, but they will have
                        issues for decision shortly. The <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> should
                        meet frequently and help to formulate our policies. I urge cooperation at
                        all levels. No one should stand on ceremony. During the campaign, I pledged
                        to implement a <pb n="38" facs="0069" xml:id="pg_38"/>new foreign policy and
                        restore the margin of safety. I look to this group to help me. The
                        Intelligence Community has a vital role. I intend to restore the vigor and
                        effectiveness of our intelligence services. (C)</p>
                    <p>I will use the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> structure to obtain your
                        guidance, but I will make the decisions. Once made, I expect the Departments
                        to implement them. Subcabinet appointments will play a vital role in
                        effective implementation. The <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> is not
                        just another cabinet agency. Although the decisions will be mine, you are
                        the obvious source for good ideas. I want good advice. The <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staff functions as an integral part of the
                        White House, and <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Dick Allen</persName> places a
                        premium on good management. (C)</p>

                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi>] I saw Amb. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> last night. Senator <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> had apparently arranged for me and <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> to have a discussion on arms
                        control. <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> had obviously been concerting
                        beforehand. I told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that the
                        first order of business was to establish an acceptable code of international
                        behavior. The first order of the day was Soviet activity in Afghanistan and
                        the use of Cuban proxies in troubled areas. The US would not stand by and
                        permit the Cubans to draw us into another Vietnam. We would get to the
                        source of the problem. The Soviets have other ideas: they want to provide
                        some formula for a phased withdrawal from Afghanistan, say, over two years
                        in return for arms control talks. (S)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>:</hi> We should make no promises on timing
                        that we could not accept at a later date. That is why I had said that six
                        months were needed before any resumption of arms talks. We don’t want to
                        appear too eager since this weakens our position. (S)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> and I have work underway on Caribbean
                        contingencies. We will have to deal with Nicaragua, El Salvador, and, most
                        especially, with Cuba. The worst thing would be to have the US dragged into
                        another draining experience like Vietnam. (S)</p>
                    <p>In the case of El Salvador, former Ambassador White was totally wrong. He
                        claimed that the government’s recent success in repelling the guerrilla
                        offensive was a victory due to our policy of <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                        arming the Salvadorans. The guerrillas did have a setback; they did not get
                        the popular support for which they hoped. Now they have adopted a classic
                        guerrilla stance. But there are only about 200 professional Salvadoran
                        military officers left. The military ranks are thin; a collapse could come
                        suddenly. The situation was so bad in San Salvador under Ambassador White
                        that Duarte couldn’t tell our Defense Attache what was happening. Only now
                        is the truth beginning to trickle out. (S)</p>
                    <p>Our interagency group is active. We are sending down a qualified, interim
                        replacement for White. <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> will also send a
                        senior adviser. In the meantime, highly sensitive contingency planning
                        continues. (S)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> My own feeling—and one about which I
                        have talked at length—is that we are way behind, perhaps decades, in
                        establishing good relations with the two Americas. We must change the
                        attitude of our diplomatic corps so that we don’t bring down governments in
                        the name of human rights. None of them is as guilty of human rights
                        violations as are Cuba and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. We
                        don’t throw out our friends just because they can’t pass the “saliva test”
                        on human rights. I want to see that stopped. We need people who recognize
                        that philosophy. In Angola, for example, <persName corresp="#p_SJM_1">Savimbi</persName> holds a large chunk of Angolan territory. With some
                        aid, he could reverse the situation. We should also reestablish relations
                        with countries like Chile who have made substantial progress—and stop
                        worrying about Allende’s fate. (S)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi> One important case is Bolivia. We withdrew our
                        Ambassador and cut off aid. When countries like this have tough things to
                        do, we should help them. If you beat them up, it works against us. We need
                        to send a good person there and open the lines of communication. (S)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>:</hi> There is no doubt that we face a tough
                        situation in El Salvador and Nicaragua. The problem stems from Cuba. With
                        some covert aid, we could disrupt Cuban activities. I am not sure that most
                        Americans understand the situation there. The majority probably believes
                        that these governments are repressive and that we should not do anything
                        provocative. We need to explain to people that this is a dangerous situation
                        for the US and that we may have to move strongly. (S)</p>

                        We welcome the change in policy. American influence has declined. In 1970,
                        we had 500 advisers in Latin America. That number has now fallen to 65. The
                        Soviets have more military advisers in Peru than we have in all of Latin
                        America. We used to bring young officers to the US for training. Our
                        training program is now down to $4 million. (S)</p>
                    <p>Only 2% of our security assistance budget goes to Latin America. The Soviets
                        provide substantially more military aid to the region. We cannot send more
                        than six advisers into a country without Congressional approval. The law
                        ties our hands. (C)</p>
                    <p>We need to let the Latin Americans know that we can be helpful. In 1975,
                        President Ford agreed we needed to put the Cubans on notice for their
                        activities in Angola. The <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName>
                        Amendment stopped us. Even if we can’t always stop the Cubans it is
                        important that we make them pay the price of admission. In the Caribbean
                        Basin what happens in one country influences the others. To stop the Cubans
                        and help others <pb n="40" facs="0071" xml:id="pg_40"/>stop them, we need
                        better intelligence, a psychological warfare program, and an ability to
                        impede guerrilla activities. (S)</p>
                    <p>In El Salvador, we probably bought about two months’ time. We have provided
                        $25 million in military equipment over the last few weeks. Another $30
                        million is in the pipeline. The Salvadorans need training. We also need to
                        work with the Honduran and Guatemalan governments. Socialist International
                        is causing us problems with political support for El Salvador. (S)</p>

                        We will wrap up our interagency work on options for El Salvador in about two
                        weeks. We need to turn the situation around. The Socialist International is
                        indeed a problem. A public communications effort about our policy is
                        essential. (S)</p>

                        for the Salvadoran guerrillas. The Cubans have a covert effort underway
                        directed toward all of Central America. They have trained 100 Guatemalans in
                        the last 90 days. Each of them returns to Guatemala with ten rifles. Radio
                        Havana broadcasts one hour daily to Guatemala in five Indian languages. The
                        Mexicans give sanctuary to Guatemalan insurgents much as the Costa Ricans
                        did for Nicaragua. (S)</p>
                    <p>The drug business through Miami is being used to finance the purchase of
                        weapons for insurgents. <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> and other
                        agencies need to pull all this together. In addition, covert action to train
                        and help local militia and police to intercept the weapons traffic from Cuba
                        would help. The Argentines are deeply involved in Central America. [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] (S)</p>

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Discussion With Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>:</hi> As I mentioned during Friday’s <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting,<note n="2" xml:id="d16fn2">See
                                <ref target="#d15">Document 15</ref>.</note> I attended a small
                        dinner party hosted by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> and our wives also attended.
                        During the dinner, Senator <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName>
                        attempted to elicit from me Executive Branch commitments on future talks
                        with the Soviet Union. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> noted that his government was very concerned that
                        your Administration would enter office with invective rather than pursuing
                        quiet talks to explore and correct differences. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> made a strong pitch for <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II and <pb n="42" facs="0073" xml:id="pg_42"/>the
                        desirability of saving resources on both sides for more urgent social needs.
                        He stated that our logic was flawed in that <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II would provide a cap on numbers of weapons and would
                        enable us at the end of the five-year period to do whatever was necessary. I
                        told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that we had not entered
                        with a predisposition towards invective but merely with a clear recognition
                        of the character of Soviet international activity.</p>
                    <p>Your view was emphasized that the first order of business between us was the
                        clear need to reach an understanding on standards of international conduct
                        citing Afghanistan, Cambodia, the Yemens, Africa, and most recently
                        stepped-up Cuban activity in this hemisphere. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s response was uncharacteristically reasonable. He
                        insisted that the Soviet Union was ready to discuss a phased withdrawal of
                        Russian forces from Afghanistan in perhaps a year or two and a future
                        non-aligned status for that country. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> was clearly pressing for a commitment to begin
                        talks on almost any subject. He was rather defensive on Poland when I raised
                        the grave consequences of Soviet intervention there. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> speculated that the situation was
                        worse and stated solemnly that the Soviets would do whatever was necessary
                        in Poland.</p>
                    <p>In sum, I informed <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that we
                        were not seeking a return to the cold war <hi rend="italic">per se</hi>, but
                        that I personally felt it would be necessary for us to witness some evidence
                        of restraint and with this in hand, the first order of business would be the
                        need to establish criteria for standards of international conduct. Only then
                        would functionally oriented dialogues such as arms control, trade credits,
                        and technology be possible.<note n="3" xml:id="d16fn3">On February 9,

                        from Kansas and wished to talk with you about the various factors involved
                        in the grain embargo problem. In your absence, I talked with her.</p>
                    <p>She said she understood many of the foreign policy aspects militating against
                        lifting the embargo but said she is obviously getting many questions from
                        farmers in her state about this subject, with many of them underlining the
                        point about the unfairness of the grain embargo since it applies only to one
                        sector of the economy. She also said that the market has been depressed for
                        two weeks and that the continuing uncertainty about a decision on the
                        embargo may be contributing to this.</p>
                    <p>She said she was tending herself to think that it might be preferable to
                        continue the grain embargo but accompany this with a total embargo on all
                        trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. I told her that such
                        a step probably would not be supported by our allies and would not be
                        effective in cutting off Soviet imports from the West; moreover, it might be
                        seen as a move which would further inflame tensions at a time when they are
                        already high. The Senator said she understood these points and that she
                        would hold off making a public recommendation for a total embargo.</p>
                    <p>Another alternative, she felt, would be to lift the embargo with the
                        understanding that we would then enter into negotiations with the Soviets
                        for a long term agreement and would make clear that we would be tough in our
                        negotiating stance. I told her I thought lifting the embargo and agreeing to
                        go into negotiations—no matter how tough we would be—risked giving the wrong
                        signal to the Soviets and to the allies, particularly in view of Soviet
                        pressures on Poland.</p>
                    <p>We also discussed the possibility of simply delaying a decision for a certain
                        period. The Senator felt that this might be feasible, although she said the
                        farmers—while not “up in arms”—will be pressing for a decision one way or
                        the other before too long.</p>

                    <p>The Senator noted that she would be meeting with the President February 17
                        together with other Senators on the embargo. She said many of her contacts
                        expect a decision to come from this meeting, but she will advise them that
                        this may not be the case.<note n="2" xml:id="d17fn2">An unknown hand drew a

                            members of Congress on February 17 from 2 to 2:45 p.m. in the Indian
                            Treaty Room in the Old Executive Office Building to discuss the grain
                            embargo. (Reagan Library, President’s Daily Diary) No memorandum of
                            conversation for the meeting was found. “Those from farm states want it
                            lifted,” he wrote in his diary. “I explained we’d made no decision but
                            while I was against the embargo we had to worry about making a
                            concession to the Soviets without some Quid Pro Quo. It might send a
                            wrong message.” (Brinkley, ed., <hi rend="italic">The <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Diaries</hi>, Vol. I, p.

               </p>
                    <p>I gathered from our talk that the Senator is understanding of all of the
                        complications involving the embargo and desires to be as helpful as
                        possible. She has not made up her own mind as to the best course of action
                        and indicated that she might be back in touch with you or with me to discuss
                        the situation further.</p>

                    <p>The Soviet Government seems to have decided to treat the anti-Soviet
                        statements of President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> and
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> as political <pb n="45" facs="0076" xml:id="pg_45"/>rhetoric which will soon give way to
                        a “realistic” recognition of the need for superpower cooperation. This
                        attitude accounts for the relatively conciliatory tone of <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s response to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>. However, Moscow seems in a tizzy
                        over the relaxed approach taken by the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration toward negotiations with it:</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>—Absence of negotiations means that Moscow lacks knowledge of the
                            personalities of the new Administration and of their thinking, a lack
                            which Soviet policy planners find exasperating.</p>
                        <p>—Continued nonchalance on our part toward negotiations is likely to have
                            the effect of making Moscow much more amenable to serious talks when the
                            time for them comes. It should therefore be pursued in the weeks to
                                come.<note n="2" xml:id="d18fn2">

                    <p>All indications are that the strong statements emanating from Washington and
                        Moscow’s inability to “probe” the new Administration has thrown confusion
                        into the Kremlin and induced it to act with circumspection in Poland.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Poland</p>
                    <p>The likelihood of a Soviet military intervention in Poland seems to be
                        receding. Soviet policy is to continue to rely on the Polish Government to
                        straighten out the situation there to its satisfaction. Large-scale Soviet
                        financial aid to Poland [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] suggests a desire to stabilize the situation for the
                        time being. Should the situation in Poland nevertheless continue to
                        deteriorate from Moscow’s point of view, the most likely response would be
                        the declaration in Poland of a state of emergency. This measure would give
                        the Polish authorities wide latitude in dealing with worker unrest and most
                        importantly enable it to isolate the intellectuals from the workers by
                        arresting the leaders of such dissident organizations as <gloss target="#t_KOR_1">KOR</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">Reference is

                        Beyond this, there looms the possibility that during the Polish Party
                        Congress scheduled for April Kania will be replaced either by Moczar or
                            Olszowski,<note n="4" xml:id="d18fn4">References are to Mieczyslaw

                        is reported to have close connections to a member of the Soviet Politburo,
                        G.V. Romanov. In this manner the Soviet Union would hope to bring Poland
                        back into the Communist straightjacket. It is worth noting that the organ of
                        the Soviet Trade Union organization <hi rend="italic">Trud</hi> has given
                        its readers surprisingly “neutral” accounts of the events in Poland which
                        confirms intelligence indications that there are individuals high in the
                        Soviet Government who believe <pb n="46" facs="0077" xml:id="pg_46"/>that
                        worker unrest in Poland is a foretaste of what awaits the Soviet Union,
                        requiring solution rather than brutal repression. (S)</p>

                            Lord</persName>’s memorandum of February 13 (attached): it is difficult
                        to see how U.S.-Soviet accords of 1972–1973 could provide viable ground
                        rules for superpower relations. They may certainly be used to embarrass the
                        Soviet Union. But the Soviet Union is in a position to exploit much more
                        effectively this particular propaganda weapon by telling the Allies that
                        such a declaratory policy is merely camouflage to conceal American
                        unwillingness to engage in negotiations and fresh proof of U.S. lack of
                        constancy and serious purpose. That is, while we, by pursuing this line,
                        could tarnish the Soviet image, they could turn it into an effective means
                        of further splitting the Western alliance. (C)</p>
                    <p>One might more usefully divide general U.S. policy vis-à-vis the Soviet Union
                        along the following lines:</p>

                  <p>1. Declare that a significant improvement in U.S.-Soviet <hi rend="italic">relations</hi> requires Soviet adherence to the

                            including in the Helsinki Accords; but that</p>

                    <p>The Secretary’s position seems to be to hold the Soviets to a strict
                        interpretation of the Basic Principles of Relations statement of 1972 and
                        the Agreement on Prevention of Nuclear War of 1973, and make any kind of
                        agreement in arms control or trade contingent on compliance with them.
                        Apparently, he would consider Soviet activities in Africa as well as
                        Afghanistan in violation of these agreements. There are several issues
                        here:</p>
                    <p>—Is it not desirable to distinguish between kinds of Soviet intervention in
                        the Third World? The invasion of Afghanistan is qualitatively more serious
                        than Soviet actions in Africa both by its magnitude and its illegitimacy
                        (ill-disguised invasion as distinct from assistance to real governments).

                    <p>—Is it not desirable to distinguish between kinds of agreements? Some arms
                        control agreements (particularly <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> but
                        also <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss>) have a large political
                        dimension and are of necessity linked with the international behavior of the
                        parties; others are largely technical in character, can be useful to the
                        U.S. under almost any international circumstances and have very low
                        political salience (for example, the nuclear accidents agreement of 1971 or
                        a prospective anti-satellite warfare agreement). (C)</p>
                    <p>—Is it not desirable to avoid reviving expectations that the Soviets will
                        ever agree to a code of international conduct forbidding all assistance to
                        “national liberation movements,” or that if they did agree (as in the early
                        1970s) it would be worth anything? There may be some political mileage to be
                        gained from redefining “detente” in this way and using it against the
                        Soviets, but they have been much more adept than we in that game, and it is
                        arguably better simply to bury the idea. (C)</p>
                    <p>—A blanket rejection of negotiation with the Soviets unless they renounce all
                        activity in the Third World will cause considerable turmoil among the West
                        Europeans, and could accelerate the split between the U.S. and its allies on
                        defense, arms control and other East-West issues. (C)</p>
                    <p>—A blanket condemnation of Soviet intervention/interference in the Third
                        World is double-edged: it can be used to condemn U.S. involvement in El
                        Salvador, for example, and in general exposes the U.S. to charges of
                        hypocrisy and double standards. (C)</p>
                    <p>In general, undiscriminating opposition to Soviet imperial activities is
                        liable to weaken the U.S. case against any particular move by the Russians.
                        It seems especially important to stress the uniqueness of the Afghan
                        intervention: it is not business as usual for the Soviets—or for the U.S.
                        (the Vietnam analogy obscures the fact that we were invited in by a real
                        government). This suggests the thought that further arms control
                        negotiations (at any rate in the major areas) should be linked to a
                        resolution of the Afghan situation, but not to Soviet withdrawal from
                        Africa. The larger point is that the U.S. should concentrate its fire on
                        those cases where the Soviets are in flagrant violation of international law
                        and custom, while opposing other Soviet activities in their own terms (i.e.
                        counter-intervention in Africa, Latin America, etc.). This course should be
                        both more effective with third countries and more difficult for the Soviets.

                    <p>1. (S—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. I doubt that I have any evidence not available to the intelligence
                        community on Soviet support for terrorism. My statement in ref B was based
                        on the assumption that we do not concede to the Soviets the right to
                        determine when a group is a “national-liberation” movement (and thus in
                        their eyes entitled to use terrorism) and when it is not (and thus
                        presumably does not have that right, at least in theory). I consider it
                        unwise to accept either the Soviet definition of “national liberation”
                        movements or the right the Soviets have arrogated to themselves to determine
                        whether a particular group fits the definition or not. I believe we are on
                        sounder ground if we consider any group which espouses the use of terrorism
                        to achieve its political ends as a terrorist group and aid to such as aid to
                        terrorism. In this sense, the Soviets are clearly guilty of aiding
                        terrorism, and they know it.</p>
                    <p>3. The issue, however, does not stop there, in my view. While the Soviets
                        have most often (and most overtly) dealt directly with groups they have
                        dubbed “national liberation” movements, they have also maintained an active
                        arms supply relationship with regimes they know are arms suppliers to
                        terrorist groups which are not so classified. Qaddafy’s Libya is a case in
                        point. I recall that, in the early 1970’s, I made a demarche on instructions
                        to the Soviet Embassy in Washington requesting that both of us refrain from
                        introducing “Redeye-type” missiles into the Middle East because of the
                        particular danger this weapon would pose if it fell into the hands of
                        terrorists. The Soviets gave us a waffling reply and shortly thereafter the
                        Italian police arrested individuals in Rome in possession of Soviet “Strela”
                        missiles. As I recall, reports at the time indicated that they had been
                        brought into <pb n="50" facs="0081" xml:id="pg_50"/>Italy in the Libyan
                        diplomatic pouch. In supplying such weapons to Qaddafy, the Soviets must
                        have been aware that he could well pass them on to terrorist groups. The
                        same, of course, can be said for their arms supply relationships with South
                        Yemen and Palestinian groups.</p>
                    <p>4. Although the intelligence community is obviously in a better position to
                        judge than I am, I believe that there is considerable evidence that the
                        Soviets have tolerated, and at times provided passive support to, training
                        of terrorists by countries such as North Korea, allowing—for example—transit
                        of “students” and instructors through the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Given the very tight controls on entry and exit here,
                        such tolerance in my view should definitely be construed as support for
                        terrorism.</p>
                    <p>5. Finally, support for terrorism can also involve covert propaganda. In this
                        area—as in others—the intelligence community is in an infinitely better
                        position than I to know the facts. However, I would classify the clandestine
                        broadcasts to Iran following the seizure of the U.S. Embassy there as a form
                        of support to a particularly flagrant act of terrorism.</p>
                    <p>6. Your question seems to imply that there is less evidence of Soviet support
                        for groups they do not classify as “national liberation” movements than I
                        had supposed. Is the intelligence community really having trouble
                        substantiating that the Soviets have indulged in indirect or covert support
                        for such groups? If so, this is important to know.</p>

                        preparations for the forthcoming Party Congress scheduled to open on
                        February 23. Elections of personnel to the Central Committee at the local

                        completed, were striking in having produced very few changes: the

                        posts. This continuity attests to the unchallenged hold on the apparatus
                        enjoyed by <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>. The only
                        significant changes to have occurred recently in the Soviet leadership have
                        taken place in the Council of Ministers where advantage was taken of

                        there has been some reshuffling of top personnel. Indications are that
                        Marshal Ogarkov, the Chief of Staff, is moving upward and may replace the
                        ailing Minister of Defense <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d21fn3">

                    <p>In a belligerent speech delivered on February 21, <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName> accused the United States and its
                        Allies of seeking to revive the cold war and subvert the “socialist”
                        community, and, indeed, making active preparations for war, including a
                        preemptive attack on the Warsaw Pact. This address was mistakenly
                        interpreted by foreign opinion as paving the way for a hard-line Congress
                        speech by <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>. As it turned out,
                        the Soviet leadership seems to have decided to travel simultaneously on two
                        roads: the aggressive “low road” given to <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName> and the conciliatory “high road” assigned to
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>. Such a dual strategy
                        gives the Soviet Union greater flexibility in meeting the challenges of the
                        new American Administration. (S)</p>
                    <p>The Soviet leadership continues to reveal extraordinary sensitivity to the
                        charge that it sponsors worldwide terrorism. Apparently it fears that this
                        accusation by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> may
                        pave the way for identifying so-called “national liberation movements”,
                        which enjoy considerable European and Third World sympathy, with terrorism,
                        which is almost universally condemned, and in this manner discredit its main
                        vehicle for Third World expansion. (S)</p>
                    <p>In reaction to the Polish events, there has been a conscientious effort by
                        the Soviet authorities to forestall potential worker unrest from breaking
                        out in their own countries. Thus, Politburo member <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName> has recently published an
                        article in an authoritative theoretical journal urging the broader
                        involvement of workers in “monitoring” Soviet management. In some of the
                        Soviet republics unusual initiatives have been taken to enroll manual
                        workers as party executives. Apparently, more intelligent communists in the
                        Soviet Union have concluded that worker antagonism to the party in Poland
                        had genuine roots and should be treated by timely concessions now rather
                        than by brute force later. (S)</p>

                        quieted down remarkably. The new Prime Minister, <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Jaruzelski</persName>, seems to enjoy the confidence of the Soviet

                        the situation by financial aid. Nevertheless, underneath the surface the
                        situation is troubling from Moscow’s point of view. Intelligence information
                        indicates that reserve officers and even policemen in Poland are talking of
                        forming unions. The attached intelligence report reflecting the opinions of

                  <hi rend="italic">Afghanistan</hi>. The news from Afghanistan is not good for
                        Moscow. There is growing evidence of large-scale drug and alcohol abuse
                        among Soviet troops as well as of the spread of communicable diseases.
                        Dysentery and typhoid are common and infectious hepatitis is said to have
                        reached “epidemic” proportions (over 8,000 cases in 1980). Senior Soviet
                        officers have been overheard to say that it may take them up to five years
                        to gain full control of the country. (S)</p>

                        relations with Moscow after repeated refusals to do so apparently stems from
                        the agreement of Moscow to stop supporting his main rival, Nkomo. It is of
                        considerable value to the Soviet Union in its concerted drive against South

                  <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s speech Monday<note n="2" xml:id="d22fn2">On February 23, <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> addressed the opening session the Twenty Sixth
                            Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. An English
                            translation of his remarks is in <hi rend="italic">The Current Digest of
                                the Soviet Press</hi>, vol. 33, no. 9, April 1, 1981, pp.
                            4–15.</note> contains no major changes in basic Soviet positions and
                        little evidence of flexibility on key issues. But it includes elements which
                        could cause us problems with the Allies. We will therefore want to discuss
                        the speech thoroughly in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> to steady
                        the Allies and prevent uncoordinated responses. The speech’s most prominent
                        points, and my plans for dealing with them, are as follows:</p>
                    <p>—US-Soviet Dialogue and Summitry: Given what we have said publicly on these
                        issues it seems unlikely Moscow expected us to take them up on <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s summit proposal. I believe we
                        should make clear that a meeting would have to have a clear purpose, be well
                        prepared, and hold promise of a successful outcome.</p>
                    <p>—Confidence Building Measures: <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> accepted the French idea that confidence building
                        measures (CBM’s) extend from the Atlantic to the Urals, but with the proviso
                        that the West also extend the area “appropriately”. This presumably means
                        applying CBM’s to parts of the US and Canada, which we and the Allies have
                        agreed is unacceptable. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> did
                        not deal with other Allied preconditions for a Conference on Disarmament in
                        Europe (<gloss target="#t_CDE_1">CDE</gloss>). We will welcome the Soviet
                        “concession” on the CBM area, but will hold the line on extensions beyond
                        Western Europe. We will also point out that other criteria must be met if
                        there is to be a <gloss target="#t_CDE_1">CDE</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—Afghanistan: The Soviets restated their conditions for a troop withdrawal
                        and for a political settlement of the dispute. But they offered to discuss
                        Afghanistan as part of a conference on the security of the Persian Gulf
                        region—an idea <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> has been
                        peddling for some time. We will reiterate our support for a political
                        settlement based on complete Soviet withdrawal and point out that the Soviet
                        proposal is <pb n="54" facs="0085" xml:id="pg_54"/>not responsive to the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions or the views of the
                        Islamic or key non-aligned states.</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>: <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                        statement of readiness to continue “appropriate” talks with the US on
                        limiting strategic arms—with no reference to ratifying <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II—is a slightly more nuanced statement
                        of the Soviet position than that previously articulated by Soviet spokesmen.
                        He also reiterated his proposal for a moratorium on the deployment of long
                        range <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> systems in Europe, which would
                        freeze the current imbalance in Moscow’s favor.</p>
                    <p>On <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, we will continue to comment
                        positively on resuming strategic arms limitation efforts, without yielding
                        on linkage or committing ourselves to a specific date. On <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>, we will continue to reaffirm our
                        commitment to the two-track <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> approach
                        to modernization of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_LRTNF_1">LRTNF</gloss> and negotiations for limiting
                            <gloss target="#t_LRTNF_1">LRTNF</gloss> deployments.</p>
                    <p>—Security Council Member Summit: <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s proposal for a summit-level Security Council
                        meeting is a straw man. They put forward a similar idea last year, which
                        died quietly for lack of international interest. Such proposals need not
                        become problems for us if we let them sink quietly.</p>

                        “includes elements which could cause us problems with the allies.” His

                        <p>—The very moderate tone <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                            assumed in discussing Central American affairs, especially his
                            significant omission of any promises of aid to Cuba from “imperialist
                            threats”. This apparently is intended to avoid adding fuel to the fire
                            in view of determined U.S. moves.</p>
                        <p>—Omission of reference to “world revolution” as an objective of Soviet
                            policy—another element in the “moderate”, “realistic” self-image.</p>
                        <p>—The overall effort to depict the Soviet Union as a reasonable,

                     <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> wants a summit meeting in
                        order to resurrect detente and to slow down US and <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> defense improvements. If the President wants a summit, he
                        might follow President Eisenhower’s example and put a price tag on it.</p>
                    <p>Early in Eisenhower’s Administration, he was faced with the issue of meeting
                        with the post-Stalin leaders of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.
                        Churchill, for one, was pushing for a Four Power summit at this time. On
                        April 16, 1953, Eisenhower made public a list of specific actions the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would have to take before the US would
                        agree to a summit. These included arms control measures, a German Peace
                        Treaty, and an Austrian State Treaty, any one of which would pay the price
                        of admission. After eight years of stalling, the Soviets agreed to the
                        Austrian Treaty, which was signed in May 1955 and resulted in the Geneva
                        Summit that summer.</p>
                    <p>Actually, the record of US-Soviet summit meetings would indicate that they
                        should be avoided altogether. With one exception, Camp David in 1959, these
                        summits have ranged from being unnecessary to nearly disastrous. For
                        example, I have long believed that the 1961 Vienna summit (in which I was
                        involved) was largely responsible for both the Berlin Wall and the Cuban
                        missile crisis. Camp David turned out to be useful in stalling off Soviet
                        action on Berlin until U–2 coverage revealed there was no “missile gap”
                        which encouraged us to take a tougher stand on Berlin.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet leaders have looked upon summits as an essential element of their
                        “detente” campaigns. The “Spirit of Geneva,” the “Spirit of Camp David,” the
                        “Spirit of Glassboro” were touted as evidence of a “relaxation of tensions”
                        (i.e. detente) and were designed, among other things, to lull the West into
                        a false sense of security. A principal goal of Soviet detente moves has been
                        to encourage <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> to decrease arms
                        expenditures. They have usually followed periods of Soviet-induced tension
                        which have resulted in increased Western defense efforts: 1949, after the
                        airlift defeat of the Berlin Blockage and after the first SAC deployment to
                        Europe; 1955 (actually beginning in 1953), after our huge Korean War
                        buildup; 1963, after the failed Cuban missile caper <pb n="57" facs="0088" xml:id="pg_57"/>and in recognition of the enormous US strategic
                        advantage; 1971–72 to control US <gloss target="#t_MIRV_1">MIRV</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> advantages and to gain increased
                        access to Western technology and financing (among other things). <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s opening speech at the 26th
                            <gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss> Congress<note n="3" xml:id="d24fn3">See <ref target="#d22fn2">footnote 2, Document
                            22</ref>.</note> makes it quite clear that the Soviets want badly to
                        resurrect detente in order to delay or fend off the announced US military
                        buildup and concomitant strengthening of Western European defenses through
                            <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> modernization, etc. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s avowed eagerness to parley with
                        us is the clear result of a tougher US stance vis-a-vis the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and an increased US defense budget.</p>
                    <p>Apart from providing the Soviet leadership with a convenient propaganda
                        platform, summits present other intrinsic problems. They are perforce short
                        and rendered even shorter by the necessity of translation; therefore the
                        serious and complicated subjects, which are usually on the agenda, can be
                        only superficially discussed. This, in turn, can lead (and has led) to
                        misunderstandings and miscalculations.</p>
                    <p>Despite the pitfalls of summit meetings with the Soviets, it is probably
                        unrealistic to expect the President to avoid them altogether. Since we
                        established relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, every
                        US President has met with his Soviet counterpart (bilaterally beginning with
                        Camp David). Presidents can scarcely resist the urge to size up their main
                        opponent. In addition, I would imagine that our European allies, who live
                        under the shadow of Soviet power, would not want us to reject <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s summit proposal out of hand.</p>
                    <p>If Eisenhower’s example is followed, a number of summit price tags could be
                        announced, for example:</p>
                    <quote>
                     <p>—Withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan (if we wanted to avoid a
                            summit altogether);</p>
                        <p>—Withdrawal of Soviet and Cuban forces from Angola and Ethiopia;</p>
                        <p>—No Soviet assistance, direct or indirect, to revolutionaries in this
                            Hemisphere;</p>
                        <p>—No direct Soviet military intervention in Poland;</p>
                        <p>—Conclusion of a satisfactory <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> III
                            Treaty.</p>
                  </quote>
                    <p>It goes without saying that any approach to the Soviets on a summit should be
                        carefully worked out on an interagency basis here and then with our allies.
                        For the time being, our public position on <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s proposal should remain strictly noncommital.</p>

                    <p>I concur in general with <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Bill
                        Stearman</persName>’s assessment of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s initiatives and his options. The Soviet leaders
                        have shown every sign of exasperation with the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration’s casual attitude toward negotiations
                        with them: in part, because such behavior deflates their global image as a
                        “superpower” which the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> is required to
                        take into account in all its foreign policy initiatives, and in part because
                        it deprives Moscow of an opportunity to size up the new U.S. Government.</p>
                    <p>However, because the “negotiating process” is popular among left-of-center
                        groups in Western Europe, it would not be prudent to dismiss <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s summit suggestion out of hand.
                        “Interesting,” “worthy of consideration” should be the U.S. reactions. In
                        practice, the proposal should be shelved. There is <hi rend="italic">no</hi>
                        need for a summit, at any rate now or in the foreseeable future. Should the
                        President nevertheless find a purely negative stance politically
                        ill-advised, he may want to pose very high preconditions: sufficiently high
                        ones to preclude a cosmetic concession on the part of Moscow which would
                        look like a genuine peaceful gesture and make us look bad if we did not wind
                        it up with a summit.</p>

                    <p>It is this Administration’s policy to ensure strict reciprocity in our

                        important that there be close coordination among all Government agencies
                        which engage in bilateral dealings with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>It is also our intention to bring the access of the Soviet Ambassador and

                    <p>I have asked that the Interagency Coordinating Committee on U.S.-Soviet

                        reciprocity. I also would appreciate your designating an official of your

                        <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I consider it necessary to turn to you concerning the most vital problems
                        that are raised by the present international situation. I suppose you are
                        aware that the Congress of our Party, which recently took place in Moscow,
                        devoted paramount attention to analysis and evaluation of the international
                        situation; as well as to the practical conclusions stemming from this. The
                        question was, what should be done in order to preserve peace and to ensure
                        for present and future generations the most basic right of each person—the
                        right to life. This is the essence of the decisions that were taken, which
                        will determine the foreign policy course of the Soviet Union in the years
                        ahead.</p>
                    <p>We are realists, and of course we take due account of the fact that
                        improvement of the international situation, the lessening and liquidation of
                        the threat of war depend not only upon us but also upon the will of other
                        governments, upon the success of establishing more <pb n="60" facs="0091" xml:id="pg_60"/>appropriate mutual understanding and effective
                        cooperation, both bilaterally and multilaterally, in resolving the vital
                        problems of present times.</p>
                    <p>We are convinced that one’s attitude toward the strategic military balance
                        that has taken shape between the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and
                        the USA, between the Warsaw Pact states and those of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, is of fundamental significance here.
                        The Soviet Union has not sought, and does not seek military superiority. But
                        neither will we permit such superiority to be established over us. Such
                        attempts, as well as attempts to talk to us from a position of strength, are
                        absolutely futile.</p>
                    <p>The existing strategic military equilibrium is objectively serving the cause
                        of preserving world peace. We are for consistently bringing matters to the
                        lowering of level of the equilibrium, without violating its balance. To
                        attempt to win in an arms race, to count on victory in an atomic war—would
                        be dangerous madness. It must be recognized that endless competition and
                        accumulation of ever newer weapons, while keeping the world under tension,
                        is the real source of the military threat that hangs over all countries. We
                        are prepared to act, hand in hand with all countries and above all with the
                        United States, in decisive struggle against this threat. It is clear the
                        great extent to which success here depends upon the joint actions precisely
                        of our two countries.</p>
                    <p>We are in general for normal, good relations with the USA, for the
                        development of these relations in the interests of the peoples of our two
                        countries, in the interests of peace.</p>
                    <p>The present state of Soviet-American relations, the sharpness of the problems
                        demanding solution, create the imperative need for the conduct and
                        development of dialogue that is active and at all levels. The Soviet Union
                        favors such a dialogue and is prepared to come to agreement regarding
                        mutually acceptable decisions, with account for the lawful interests of the
                        sides.</p>
                    <p>Soviet-American summit meetings have special significance in all this, and at
                        the Congress we considered it feasible and advisable to speak out directly
                        in favor of such a meeting.</p>
                    <p>As is known, in recent years the Soviet Union has put forward numerous
                        proposals for reducing the threat of war and for strengthening international
                        security. Many of these have been approved by the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and other impressive fora. All of our proposals remain in
                        force and we will work toward their realization.</p>
                    <p>However, the current situation is such that it is necessary to intensify
                        efforts still more in order to improve the international situation
                        radically, to give people confidence in a safe, peaceful future. Guided by
                        this vital necessity, the Soviet Union has come forward with new, large
                        initiatives permeated with deep concern to restrain the arms race, deepen
                        detente, strengthen peace.</p>
                    <pb n="61" facs="0092" xml:id="pg_61"/>
                    <p>I found it necessary to call your personal attention, Mr. President, to these
                        proposals, put forward, as you know, at the Congress of our Party. Apart
                        from the scale and the far-reaching character of these initiatives, I wish
                        in particular to underscore their realism, the account they take of both our
                        own interests as well as the interests of our partners.</p>
                    <p>Experience shows how complicated and difficult it is to liquidate, to
                        extinguish hotbeds of military conflict. It is therefore important to
                        conduct preventative work to prevent such hotbeds from occurring.</p>
                    <p>In this context, measures to strengthen trust in the military sphere, carried
                        out at the decision of the all-European conference, play a positive role.
                        The Soviet Union has made proposals for widening significantly the volume of
                        these measures.</p>
                    <p>We are now proposing to widening substantially the zone of applicability of
                        such measures. We are prepared to extend them to the entire European part of
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, on the condition, of course, of
                        a corresponding widening of the zone of measures of trust by the Western
                        states. I would like in this connection once again to emphasize that the
                        Soviet Union favors the successful conclusion of the Madrid meeting.
                        Adoption at it of a decision to call an all-European conference for
                        discussion and solution of problems of military detente and disarmament in
                        Europe would have a particularly important significance.</p>
                    <p>We also consider that the working out and adoption of measures of trust could
                        also be useful in the area of the Far East. The Soviet Union would be
                        prepared to conduct concrete negotiations on this account with all
                        interested countries. Without predetermining now all problems relating to
                        such negotiations, attention nonetheless should be called to the fact that
                        in this region not only the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, China
                        and Japan are neighbors. As is known, there is also a U.S. military
                        presence. This and other specifics of the region would have to be
                        considered, so that measures of trust would in fact be effective.</p>
                    <p>In some countries the opinion is expressed that our recent proposals
                        concerning the Persian Gulf cannot be separated from the question of the
                        presence of a Soviet military contingent in Afghanistan. Our position
                        consists of the following: while prepared to reach agreement on the Persian
                        Gulf as an independent problem, and to participate in a separate settlement
                        of the situation around Afghanistan, we also do not object to the questions
                        connected with Afghanistan being discussed in conjunction with the questions
                        of the security of the Persian Gulf. Such discussions naturally can concern
                        only the international aspects of the Afghan problem, and not the internal
                        affairs of that country. The sovereignty of Afghanistan must be
                        fully-protected, as must its status as a nonaligned state.</p>
                    <p>Proceeding from the exceptional importance—not only for the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the U.S.A., but also for other
                        countries—of the problem of <pb n="62" facs="0093" xml:id="pg_62"/>limiting
                        and reducing strategic weapons, we for our part are prepared to continue
                        without delay appropriate talks with the United States while preserving
                        everything positive that has been achieved thus far in this field. It is
                        understandable that such negotiations can be conducted only on the basis of
                        equality and equal security of the sides.</p>
                    <p>As one of the practical measures in this area, we are prepared to reach
                        agreement on limiting the deployment of new submarines—in the U.S.A., the
                        Ohio class, and submarines of a similar type in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. We could also enter into accord on
                        banning modernization of existing ballistic missiles and the creation of new
                        ones for deployment on these submarines.</p>
                    <p>Attempting to avert the dangerous accumulation of nuclear missiles in Europe
                        and to facilitate the speediest possible attainment of a decision regarding
                        such weapons, we propose that agreement be reached on establishing a
                        moratorium now on the deployment in Europe of new medium-range nuclear
                        missile facilities in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the
                        countries of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>—that is, to freeze both
                        quantitatively and qualitatively the existing level of such means,
                        including, of course, the forward-based nuclear facilities of the U.S.A. in
                        this region. Such a moratorium could come into force as soon as negotiations
                        on this question commence, and would be effective until a treaty is
                        concluded on limiting, or even better, on reducing such nuclear facilities
                        in Europe. In this we proceed from the position that both sides would cease
                        all preparations for deployment of corresponding additional means, including
                        the American Pershing II missiles and ground-based strategic cruise
                        missiles.</p>
                    <p>Judging from reports we have received, in certain places attempts are being
                        made to represent the situation as if there were nothing new in this Soviet
                        proposal. Nothing could be further from the truth. Assertions of this sort
                        can only indicate an effort to evade a decision of the matter, a lack of
                        desire to take account of the vital interests of the European peoples.</p>
                    <p>We consider that informing the general public, indeed all people, of the
                        consequences with which atomic war is fought would have great significance,
                        and would in particular bring additional influence on governments for
                        attainment of agreements directed in a practical way toward averting such a
                        war. With this aim in mind, we propose the creation of an authoritative
                        international committee that would demonstrate the vital necessity of
                        averting a nuclear catastrophe. The committee might include the most
                        prominent scientists from various countries. Very likely the General
                        Secretary of the U.N. could play a role in the realization of this aim. The
                        conclusions reached by the committee should be made known to the entire
                        world.</p>
                    <p>Further, for solution of many current international problems a far-sighted
                        approach, political will and courage, authority and influence <pb n="63" facs="0094" xml:id="pg_63"/>are required. This is why we believe it
                        would be useful to convene a special session of the Security Council, with
                        the participation of the top leaders of the permanent and non-permanent
                        member states of the Council, in order to seek the key to improving the
                        international atmosphere and preventing war. Leaders of other states
                        obviously could take part in the session, if they wished. Naturally,
                        thorough preparation for such a session would be required to ensure positive
                        results.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the theme of hotbeds of tension and the task of liquidating
                        them, I would like particularly to single out the question of the situation
                        in the Middle East. No matter how one regards that which has thus far been
                        done in this region, it is clear that political settlement there has been
                        set back. The present situation urgently demands a return to a collective
                        search for an all-embracing settlement on a just and realistic basis, which
                        could be done, say within the framework of a specially convened
                        international conference.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union is prepared to take part in a constructive spirit in such
                        work jointly with other interested Liberation Front, and with Israel. We are
                        prepared for such a joint search with the U.S.A., with which we have had in
                        the past certain experience. We are prepared to cooperate with European
                        states, with all who sincerely desire securing a just and stable peace in
                        the Middle East. The U.N. clearly can continue to play a useful role
                        here.</p>
                    <p>These are the questions that I wanted to touch upon in this message. We
                        expect, Mr. President, that you will regard our proposals with appropriate
                        attention. As you see, they embrace a wide circle of problems and foresee
                        measures of a political and military character; they concern various types
                        of weapons and military forces; they touch upon the situation in various
                        regions of the world.</p>
                    <p>We of course understand that time is required for study and consideration.
                        Probably the necessity for some sort of consultations, exchange of views—in
                        short, for various forms of dialogue—will arise. We are prepared for
                        this.</p>

                        Even our comprehensive review of East-West relations will take several

                    <p>In the meantime, we can’t be simply reacting to Soviet initiatives, or acting

               </p>
                    <p>This memorandum provides an approach to both.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Problem</p>
                    <p>Our basic goals are clear. We must correct the growing imbalance in US-Soviet
                        military power, and restrain increasingly aggressive Soviet behavior,
                        particularly in regions of vital interest to the United States. We want to
                        establish a relationship based on much greater Soviet acceptance of
                        reciprocity and restraint.</p>
                    <p>But we face this dilemma:</p>
                    <p>—Building such a relationship will take time and persistent pressure. We need
                        the kind of major, long-term expenditure of resources for defense which
                        cannot be sustained if we return to a climate of business-as-usual in the
                        near to mid-term. We must maintain pressure on the Soviets for an extended
                        period to convince them of the need to change their behavior.</p>
                    <p>—But we cannot get the Allies on board this long-term effort if they believe
                        we are embarked on a path of unending, unnecessary, and dangerous
                        confrontation. The Soviets already are having a certain success in Europe
                        with their peace offensive.</p>
                    <p>To the extent the Soviets can separate us from the Allies, major elements of
                        our plans for redressing the military imbalance and constraining Soviet
                        international behavior will be hamstrung. Thus, preserving Alliance
                        solidarity is of equal importance—and in a real sense is a <hi rend="italic">precondition</hi>—to the attainment of our security objectives.</p>
                    <p>Facing this dilemma, we must fight against the temptation to force decisions
                        on others, or to try to do everything ourselves. <hi rend="italic">Unilateralism simply won’t work</hi>—<hi rend="italic">whether passive
                            a la <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>, or aggressive as
                            there are some pressures for now (<gloss target="#t_ERW_1">ERW</gloss>,
                                <gloss target="#t_SLCM_1">SLCMs</gloss>)</hi>. We must bring others
                        with us through strong leadership and close cooperation.</p>
                    <pb n="67" facs="0098" xml:id="pg_67"/>
                    <p>Therefore what we need is a <hi rend="italic">policy of aggressive
                            multilateralism</hi>. In order to elicit Allied confidence in and
                        support for our approach to East-West relations, we must work intensively
                        with them and be willing to take into account their sensitivities—while
                        pushing for our basic objectives. To a much greater extent than in the past,
                        we must weigh Allied concerns into our specific decisions vis-a-vis the
                        Soviets and critical problems outside Europe.</p>
                    <p>At the same time we cannot allow the initiatives we must take in the military
                        sphere and elsewhere to be paralyzed by our concern over European
                        sensitivities. Looking to the longer term, we must start now to <hi rend="italic">shape</hi> European attitudes.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">General Framework for the Political Program</p>
                    <p>To convey the right signals to the Soviets and to get the Allies on board, we
                        need to enunciate and pursue a political program which is:</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">hard-headed</hi> about our present situation and the need
                        for fundamental change and</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">realistic but confident</hi> about the future if
                        fundamental change occurs.</p>
                    <p>Our proclaimed objective would be to bring greater order and civility to
                        international affairs. We would proceed from the fact that the East-West
                        competition will continue and that the West must act to further its own
                        interests. But we also would seek to keep the competition within safe limits
                        and to permit the pursuit of some mutual interests. But we would stress that
                        this requires above all the establishment of a greater degree of Soviet
                        restraint.</p>
                    <p>We would emphasize that old restraints have weakened: because Soviet power
                        has grown enormously, because new and more lucrative targets of opportunity
                        have emerged (viz. the Persian Gulf), and because Western resolve has been
                        called into question. And we can stress that the Soviet temptation to act
                        aggressively increases as Soviet power increases, and increases further
                        whenever the Soviets project power successfully.</p>
                    <p>We would stress that actions need to be taken in three areas to build new
                        restraint:</p>
                    <p>1. Restoring military capabilities which are adequate to protect Western
                            interests.<note n="4" xml:id="d28fn4">

               </p>
                    <p>2. Promoting stability in key regions through diplomatic and other
                            efforts.<note n="5" xml:id="d28fn5">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> placed a checkmark at the end of this

               </p>
                    <pb n="68" facs="0099" xml:id="pg_68"/>
                    <p>3. Designing direct relations with the Soviet Union (trade, arms control) to
                        encourage restraint and penalize aggression.<note n="6" xml:id="d28fn6">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> placed a checkmark at
                            the end of this sentence.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>We need to make clear the relationship between these three:</p>
                    <p>—the development of adequate military capabilities is essential to induce
                        greater Soviet restraint in key areas and to provide them incentive for
                        serious, equitable arms control.<note n="7" xml:id="d28fn7">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> placed a checkmark at the end of
                            this point.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>—the active promotion of regional stability is essential to our security and
                        to more constructive East-West<note n="8" xml:id="d28fn8">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> placed a checkmark at the end of
                            this point.</note> relations.</p>
                    <p>—cooperation in arms control, trade and other areas will always be vulnerable
                        unless the Soviets exercise greater restraint in their military programs and
                        international conduct. Therefore linkage is a fact of life and must be an
                        important tool of policy.</p>
                    <p>Our objective by the end of this year should be <hi rend="italic">first, to
                            get as much Allied consensus as possible on this general approach and;
                            second, to convince the Soviets that it will endure and that they must
                            begin to operate within its constraints.</hi> We must firmly establish
                        that this Administration will have this and only this approach, and that the
                        US-Soviet and East-West relationship will be determined by it. We need to
                        make clear that a fundamentally negative course for our relationship will be
                        set for years to come if the Soviets ignore it (i.e., occupy Poland). A more
                        positive direction is possible if they are prepared to begin to act with
                        restraint.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Benchmarks for the Political Program</p>
                    <p>We need a work program to give each of the three elements of this political
                        program (military restoration, regional stability, contingent cooperation)
                        specific content. But first we must relate it to specific benchmarks over
                        the next six-nine months. The two most important are:</p>

                        the United States. We face three current test cases for Soviet restraint in

                        cultural affinity. It is essential that we work with key regional states

                        the answer, the Allies seem willing to watch us proceed without major
                        objection at this stage. Moscow’s continuing low profile in El Salvador,
                        moreover, indicates the Kremlin does not want this to become a major
                        East-West issue at a time when it is courting Europe on other matters. But
                        if our support for the Duarte regime is perceived as part of a broader
                        pattern of expanding US relations with authoritarian regimes in Latin

                        examine ways to increase pressure on the Soviets in Afghanistan—helping
                        Pakistan, keeping attention in appropriate fora on the Soviet occupation,
                        and reviewing aid to the Afghan nationalists.</p>

               </p>
                    <p>As noted above, Poland will be seen as a test case for the viability of our
                        policy of differentiating between the Soviets and the governments of East
                        Europe. While the Allies will expect us to join them in economic and
                        political efforts to stabilize Poland’s economy, the effort could fail and
                        the Soviets intervene—or the Soviets could intervene anyway. It will be
                        difficult to get the Allies to do much more to lay the foundation for a
                        strong, coherent Western response in the present context. But should the
                        Soviets invade we must be prepared to exploit a new climate of opinion in
                        Western Europe to move ahead with the Allies on several fronts, e.g.
                        military and trade. <hi rend="italic">We also should do what we can in the
                            months ahead to help lay the foundations for Poland’s economic and
                            financial recovery as a deterrent to Soviet aggression</hi>. We should
                        keep in mind that as long as Polish events continue in a positive direction,
                        so does the potential affect they have on the internal situation in
                        neighboring countries including the Soviet Union.</p>

                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Arms control</hi>. We need to strike a careful balance
                        between not going back to business-as-usual, testing the Soviets’ bona fides
                        in arms control and demonstrating to our Allies that we are willing to do
                        so. The specific objective for arms control should be to constrain Soviet
                        military capabilities, but it is unlikely we will have significant success
                        in the near-term and should plan our own forces accordingly.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> meeting this spring. As the

                        is unclear at this stage precisely when and how we want to proceed with the

                        we should go on the offensive publicly and diplomatically.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Not Moving Across the Board</hi>. We should not feel
                        compelled to make other moves before September unless it is clearly in our
                        interest. We have major decisions to make before we enter into even an
                        informal dialogue with the Soviets on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. Our policy on nuclear testing and other arms control issues
                        also requires major review.</p>
                    <p>We also should prepare for and launch <hi rend="italic">two basic dialogues
                            about the role and future course of arms control</hi>.</p>
                    <p>—First, we need a serious dialogue with our Allies. There are major
                        differences about the political purposes and security significance of arms
                        control, with some of our Allies seeing it as an essential part of
                        preserving political detente in Europe regardless of Soviet behavior
                        elsewhere, and as an alternative to increased defense spending. Once our own
                        policies are sufficiently developed, we need to strive for a new consensus
                        with our Allies about what arms control realistically can accomplish.</p>
                    <p>—Second, beginning with your meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, we need a US-Soviet dialogue on a more realistic
                        approach to arms control and how it relates to larger objectives (e.g.,
                        Soviet behavior in the Third World).</p>
                    <p>Our stance in the meantime should be that: we already are moving in key areas
                        like <gloss target="#t_CDE_1">CDE</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>, we are prepared to consider any serious, balanced arms
                        control measures the Soviets want to propose before our first high-level
                        meeting, and we expect them to exercise restraint with their programs in the
                        interim.</p>
                    <pb n="75" facs="0106" xml:id="pg_75"/>
                    <p>B. <hi rend="italic">East-West Trade</hi>. Afghanistan and the prospect of
                        Soviet intervention in Poland have raised Allied consciousness on the issue
                        of unrestricted trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>,
                        particularly in sensitive areas. But we are a long way from having even a US
                        policy, much less an Allied consensus on such matters as: the use of
                        economic leverage to moderate Soviet foreign policy, the implications of
                        increased European dependence on Soviet energy resources, and restrictions
                        on transfer of sensitive technology. Much more needs to be done and we will
                        need good working relations with the Allies to do it.</p>
                    <p>The interagency study on East-West economic relations must proceed in a
                        timely fashion. By mid-May, we should be ready for <persName corresp="#p_RM_1">Rashish</persName> to discuss the general problems we
                        see in this area with the G–6 on the fringe of the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss>’s Executive Committee in Special Session (XCSS). At <hi rend="italic">the Ottawa Summit</hi> in July, we should set out more
                        concrete East-West economic concerns and formally launch our effort to build
                        a new Western consensus. Thus, by your September meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, we will have begun the process of
                        developing greater Alliance cohesion. Ultimately, it will be important to be
                        able to argue credibly that Western trade will be affected by Soviet
                        behavior—in both a positive and negative direction.</p>

                        that the Allies believe we see the <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> bilateral as a genuine opportunity to move the
                        relationship in a con<pb n="76" facs="0107" xml:id="pg_76"/>structive
                        direction, and that there is no need for them to take initiatives in the
                        interim which would be counter-productive, e.g. French proposal for a
                        multilateral summit. We set forth below the specific agenda of consultations
                        with the Allies and Soviets leading to September.</p>

                        Having a European audience would be a major asset for a speech on

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> said Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had asked him to raise
                        several points with the group. This Administration’s approach to the Soviets
                        will not be business as usual; there will be changes. Both the President and
                        Secretary were particularly concerned with the matter of reciprocity which
                        was now being studied to determine where we have leverage which can be
                        employed to achieve a more balanced treatment. He noted that a one-for-one
                        basis is not possible. In some areas the Soviets have more flexibility than
                        we do. In some cases, we are already in a more advantageous position (i.e.,
                        parking). The Ambassador stressed the importance of coordinating contacts
                        with the Soviets. Referring to the new requirement that all U.S.G. officials
                        notify the Office of Soviet Affairs prior to any contact with Soviet
                        officials, <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> noted that
                        the intent of the policy is to establish a data base on the scope and
                        frequency of Soviet access. We may later decide to cut back on Soviet
                        access.</p>

                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> noted that the
                        notification requirement doesn’t hold for contacts with Soviets in the
                        context of multilateral meetings.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> noted that if other
                        agencies wished to propose new initiatives vis-a-vis the Soviets, we might
                        need to engage the Secretary.</p>
                    <p>In any event, we need to know in advance of anything involving new areas.
                        Coordination is essential to make sure we all sing from the same sheet of
                        music.</p>
                    <p>Turning to exchanges, <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName>
                        stated he didn’t know in the fullness of time what the Administration’s view
                        would be. While the review was being conducted, however, we should avoid
                        foreclosing our options. Agencies should seek to prevent budget cuts from
                        killing off the administrative machinery of the various exchanges.</p>
                    <p>Pillsbury (<gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>) raised issues of private
                        U.S. citizen contacts with Soviet officials. He suggested that we might wish
                        to monitor such contacts. Private individuals having frequent contacts could
                        form (on a voluntary basis) an association analagous to <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>’s <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> Institute, whose reciprocal access the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> could attempt to ensure.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> responded that although
                        we would consider the idea we would be treading on dangerous ground here and
                        that there didn’t appear to be a legal possibility of exercising such
                        control.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the Foreign Missions Act, <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> noted that it would grant us more authority in
                        dealing with the Soviets on the whole range of reciprocity concerns. The
                        Ambassador then excused himself and turned the meeting over to Deputy
                        Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Barry</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Barry</persName> stated that a review was now in
                        progress of the whole range of East-West relations. The review could consume
                        several months. However, certain elements were clear. The codewords current
                        during the <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> Administration,
                        cooperation and competition, had given way to the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> formulation of restraint and
                        reciprocity.</p>
                    <p>The key element in ensuring Soviet restraint was to restore a worldwide
                        military balance. We will also strive to achieve stability in key areas
                        which the Soviets would be otherwise tempted to exploit. Our relations will
                        be conducted on the basis of linkage. We will make sure the Soviets
                        understand that no aspect of our relations will be carried out in a
                        vacuum.</p>
                    <p>We do not plan to negotiate a new code of conduct to replace that embodied in
                        the 1972 Agreement of Principles, but we do intend to gain implicit
                        adherence by the Soviets to its provisions; e.g., not to exacerbate
                        tensions. We are not prepared to tolerate Soviet-supported efforts by the
                        Cubans to undermine the stability of El Salvador. On Afghanistan, the
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration took a no
                        more relaxed attitude than the previous Administration. A political
                        settlement including Soviet withdrawal is an essential element of a more
                        positive climate <pb n="79" facs="0110" xml:id="pg_79"/>in U.S.-Soviet
                        relations. Our sanctions should stay in place, leaving aside the grain
                        embargo which was still under review. The situation in Poland remains
                        uncertain and unstable with a continuing tug of war between Solidarity, the
                        Government, the Party and the Church. While we do not regard Soviet
                        intervention in Poland as inevitable, we have closely consulted with our
                        Allies on our response which would be far more unified and cut far deeper
                        than was the case after Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>We are now in the midst of a Soviet peace offensive designed to separate us
                        from our Allies. The new impetus provided by <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s speech to the Party Congress was more tactical
                        than substantive. We are working with our Allies, however, to turn the
                        Soviets’ new stand on CBM’s into a meaningful step in <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. is now comparing notes with other recipients of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> letters.<note n="2" xml:id="d29fn2">On March 13, <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName> wrote <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had sent “almost identical letters to all heads
                            of state in the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Alliance.”
                            (Reagan Library, Office of the Assistant to the President for National

                        <persName corresp="#p_LJ_1">Luns</persName>’ statement today on behalf of
                        the Alliance will make clear that the Soviets haven’t succeeded in derailing
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> arms modernization.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Barry</persName> concluded by noting that Soviet
                        actions are more important than words. A Summit Meeting would not be useful
                        without a demonstration of Soviet restraint. Summits must be carefully
                        prepared with the expectation of concrete results. A dialogue with the
                        Soviets is being carried on.</p>
                    <p>Bader (<gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>) asked what was the vehicle for
                        this dialogue. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Barry</persName> responded it was
                        normal diplomatic channels in Moscow and in Washington. Bader then noted
                        that no one had reaffirmed since January 20 that our goal in Afghanistan was
                        Soviet withdrawal. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Barry</persName> responded
                        that while there was obviously no near term prospect, Soviet withdrawal and
                        deterrence remained the goals of our sanctions policy.</p>
                    <p>A great deal more emphasis was now placed on reciprocity. While there was no
                        intent to focus <gloss target="#t_ICCUSA_1">ICCUSA</gloss> solely on
                        reciprocity concerns, it provided a good vehicle for exchange of information
                        and coordination since all agencies with regular Soviet contacts were
                        represented.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Barry</persName> reiterated <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName>’s comments on the contacts
                        policy set out in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s
                        interagency memo.<note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3">See <ref target="#d25">Document
                                25</ref>.</note> In response to a question from Baldyga (<gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss>), <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Barry</persName> noted that a separate exercise was being conducted
                        with regard to Eastern Europe. He added that purely social contacts with
                        Soviets were still out in line with our post-Afghanistan policy.</p>
                    <pb n="80" facs="0111" xml:id="pg_80"/>
                    <p>Starbird (<gloss target="#t_EPA_1">EPA</gloss>) asked whether each agency
                        should set up a parallel body to coordinate this policy. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Barry</persName> said it was up to each agency; the
                        important factor was that we be notified. <persName corresp="#p_GR_2">German</persName> (<gloss target="#t_EURSOV_1">EUR/SOV</gloss>) noted
                        that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s interagency
                        memo had asked agencies to designate an official to coordinate such contacts
                        with the Office of Soviet Affairs.</p>
                    <p>After noting that the State Department was instituting a more strictly
                        enforced escort policy for visiting Soviets, <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Barry</persName> urged other agencies to tighten their policies in a
                        similar fashion. Several representatives noted that their agencies lacked
                        the security necessary to enforce such a policy and that Soviets routinely
                        showed up unannounced. Linn (<gloss target="#t_HHS_1">HHS</gloss>) suggested
                        that the State Department was the appropriate body to notify the Soviet
                        Embassy that their staff must call in advance to any office they wished to
                        visit. It was decided to study further this issue.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GR_2">German</persName> then referred to a range of
                        other areas which we would be reviewing, stressing that this list was
                        illustrative rather than comprehensive. Working groups might be established
                        for some issues whereas no immediate action might be required for others
                        (e.g., staffing levels). The Soviets are now at their ceiling and we might
                        face retaliation if we denied visas for any officials over the limit. He
                        also noted that we might consider cutting our staff in response to Soviet
                        intervention in Poland.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GR_2">German</persName> noted that we have tightened up
                        on our travel controls which apply to diplomats, correspondents and
                        businessmen. Closed area exceptions are granted only on a one-for-one basis.
                        Several recent cases of denials were mentioned. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Barry</persName> mentioned that <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had approved a recent memo which informed him that we
                        would get complaints on travel turndowns and expected support for our
                        position. We’re prepared to take the heat.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GR_2">German</persName> noted that the McGovern
                            amendment<note n="4" xml:id="d29fn4">A reference to the McGovern
                            amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act, which provided an
                            automatic waiver recommendation for Soviets who were inadmissible to the
                            United States solely because of Communist Party membership.</note>
                        constrained our ability to deny visas solely on reciprocity grounds. There
                        has been a rash of Soviet turndowns of U.S. visa requests for governesses
                        and personal guests for which there is no Soviet equivalent to retaliate
                        against.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GR_2">German</persName> concluded by referring to the
                        issue of Soviet attendance at U.S. scientific and commercial conferences and
                        exhibits. He noted the difficulty of urging hosts not to invite Soviets.
                            <gloss target="#t_COMEX_1">COMEX</gloss> is also involved in this area.
                        Export control regulations could be invoked in some cases.</p>
                    <pb n="81" facs="0112" xml:id="pg_81"/>
                    <p>Hal Burman (State–L) described the intent of the proposed Foreign Missions
                        Act to ensure reciprocity in all our respective bilateral relationships by
                        controlling foreign diplomats’ access to U.S. goods and services if
                        necessary. The legislation is expected to be introduced by the House and
                        possibly the Senate as well in 2 to 3 weeks. A draft bill may be available
                        in a week and State may contact representatives to check whether their
                        agencies had any conflicting regulations and to solicit their support. Last
                        year’s bill had enjoyed substantial foreign affairs community support.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Barry</persName> noted again that social contacts
                        with Soviets were still strongly discouraged. Obviously, this may touch on
                        gray areas. There should be no reason to attend a reception for a visiting
                        Soviet if it did not involve official business.</p>
                    <p>Herspring (<gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>) reported that <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>’s foreign military liaison had extensive
                        routine contacts with the Soviets and asked whether each contact had to be
                        reported individually. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Barry</persName> replied
                        that some form of blanket notification might be able to be worked out.</p>
                    <p>Linn (<gloss target="#t_HHS_1">HHS</gloss>) asked for a written expression of
                        support for exchanges, given the severe budgetary threat. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Barry</persName> stated that <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> was sending such a letter to
                        all the U.S. Co-Chairmen and Executive Secretaries of the bilateral
                        agreements asking for continued exchange funding so as not to foreclose
                        options while broad review was in progress.</p>
                    <p>Britton (<gloss target="#t_HUD_1">HUD</gloss>) reported that his agency’s
                        budget authorization excluded funding for contacts with Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Bradley (<gloss target="#t_DOE_1">DOE</gloss>) reported that his agency’s
                            <gloss target="#t_MHD_1">MHD</gloss> program would not be continued for
                        technical reasons. The recovery of the program’s super-conducting magnet was
                        not yet determined. A delegation scheduled to visit the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in mid-April would formally notify them
                        of the program’s termination.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Barry</persName> concluded the meeting by
                        reminding representatives to coordinate new contacts policy with all

                    <p>I attended the 60th birthday party dinner of Don Kendall near Greenwich,
                        Connecticut last night, having accepted the invitation at the last meeting
                        of the PepsiCo Board that I attended as a Director, prior to the
                        Inauguration.</p>
                    <p>At the dinner, it turned out that one of the guests was <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Anatoly Dobrynin</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> Ambassador. During the pre-dinner
                        reception, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked if he could
                        have a word with me and I replied noncommittally and continued talking with
                        a number of other guests. Eventually, Kendall brought me over to <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> and the following conversation
                        ensued:</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>: In what direction do you see
                        our two countries moving? Why is there so much rhetoric in the air now?</p>
                    <p>
                  <gloss target="#t_CWW_1">CWW</gloss>: I think that part of it is because
                        people in Washington feel it important that the Soviets and the world know
                        that the U.S. has changed, and that we have, and will acquire, much greater
                        strength as well as firmness and resolve during this Administration, and
                        that there is also great concern about the Soviet actions in Afghanistan and
                        around Poland.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>: I assure you that my country
                        knows very well how much the U.S. has changed. I tell them. I am a good
                        reporter. But don’t you think it important that our two countries talk to
                        each other and not just exchange statements?</p>
                    <p>
                  <gloss target="#t_CWW_1">CWW</gloss>: Yes, if the atmosphere and
                        circumstances are such that there is some prospect of effective talks, and
                        some possibility of a successful conclusion to such talks. If the Soviets
                        went into Poland, it would be a clear signal that such talks would be
                        useless.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>: Poland! It is essential in
                        Poland that we not have aggressive actions on our own border. You would not
                        allow it.</p>
                    <p>
                  <gloss target="#t_CWW_1">CWW</gloss>: But many of our allies do things we do
                        not like, but we do not manuever on their borders or threaten their
                        independence.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>: But the Warsaw Pact is
                        different. We cannot have hostile governments on our borders. In any event,
                        we should talk.</p>
                    <p>At this point, various other people drifted by and I did not encourage
                        continuance of any further one-on-one discussion.</p>
                    <pb n="83" facs="0114" xml:id="pg_83"/>
                    <p>Also guests at the dinner were <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry
                            Kissinger</persName>, who expressed to me strong support for use of the
                        neutron missiles as a means of strengthening theatre nuclear forces, and
                        former President Nixon, who did not say anything substantive to me.</p>
                    <p>The principal conclusion I drew from the conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> is that he and the Soviets
                        urgently want talks to begin, and are really quite concerned at the
                        perceived strength of anti-Soviet position.</p>

                    <p>The breakfast began with discussion of a Cabinet Council meeting concerning
                        East/West trade. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> said
                        that he would not attend the meeting, because no detailed agenda had been
                        circulated.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to the Soviet Union.]</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> then asked what the Saudis
                        thought about the Sinai issue. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> said that they were still opposed to the Camp David
                        Agreements. <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> then noted
                        that Fahd Abdullah, in talks at the Pentagon, was pushing for all five F–15
                        items. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> said that this
                        was unacceptable, and that he had been told the Saudis were not going to
                        receive bomb racks for the aircraft.</p>
                    <pb n="84" facs="0115" xml:id="pg_84"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> then asked <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> if he had seen recent
                        intelligence reports<note n="2" xml:id="d31fn2">Not further
                            identified.</note> about the shipment of Soviet guns and tanks to
                        Nicaragua. <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> said that he
                        wished the United States had the capability to blow up some of it. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> agreed and, changing the
                        subject, said that he was unhappy about the way Japanese auto import issues
                        were being handled. He said that the two cabinet officials involved in the
                        issue were doing too much talking with the press. <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> said that the problem, in part,
                        stemmed from the new system of Cabinet Councils, which were being run by
                            <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Ed Meese</persName> in the White House.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> noted that nobody had
                        elected <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Ed Meese</persName> and that he was not
                        going to send anyone from the State Department to this morning’s Council
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> then said that there
                        was an “<gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>” meeting every day in the form
                        of the President’s security briefing. He said this was more than a briefing
                        and that <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Meese</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_BJA_1">Baker</persName> were using it to make policy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> said that he was going to have a
                        “showdown” with the White House on lines of responsibility and over leaks
                        which had come from the White House. <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> agreed that leaks were a problem and noted that
                        in nearly every Evans/Novak article the third paragraph said what a “great
                        guy” <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Dick Allen</persName> was.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> then asked what, if
                        anything, the Administration should be telling the Russians. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> said that it would be a
                        mistake to talk with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> until
                        the Administration had an action plan. <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> agreed, saying that <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> was extremely clever and that he did not want to
                        talk with him until the Administration had a policy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> went further and said
                        that the Administration needed a game plan for Cuba. <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> agreed that more work was
                        necessary on Cuba. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> asked
                        whether the Administration was ready to do some “meaningful” things.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> said there was little
                        the Administration could do, because it possessed no economic leverage [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>], only military
                        power. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> agreed and added that a
                        military response was probably necessary. <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> said that the Administration should consider a
                        blockade of Cuba. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                        agreed, and said that the President had to consider this option. <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> added that the Administration’s
                        covert action capability [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>]. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> then sketched out a scenario:</p>
                    <p>The Russians are distracted, he said, and the military balance in some
                        respects was still favorable. He said that, if <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> continued to conduct business as usual, the
                        Administration would be “nibbled” to <pb n="85" facs="0116" xml:id="pg_85"/>death. The President, he added, is going to be the “President or he
                        isn’t.” <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> then asked whether
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> was suggesting a
                        blockade of Cuba? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                        answered by saying that he wanted to consider a full range of actions,
                        including air strikes. He said that in conversations with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>, he had concluded that the
                        Russians were not prepared to defend Cuba against strong American action.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> said that this sounded
                        like a Soviet invitation to get tough with Cuba. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> agreed and said the United States had
                        to play “two balancing games”—dealing with Cuba and helping the Egyptians
                        against Libya. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> then
                        said that <persName corresp="#p_PR_2">Richard Pipe</persName>’s interview in
                        the press had made the Administration’s task more difficult.<note n="3" xml:id="d31fn3">In an interview with <hi rend="italic">Reuters</hi>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_PR_2">Pipes</persName> made disparaging
                            comments about <persName corresp="#p_GHD_1">Genscher</persName>, and
                            declared: “Soviet leaders would have to choose between peacefully
                            changing their Communist system in the direction followed by the West or
                            going to war. There is no other alternative and it could go either way.”

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> then said that he was
                        going to raise this with the President, adding that either the President
                        agreed to a disciplined system of decision-making or that he would retire to
                        Connecticut. <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> then asked how

                        tensions too, not just East-West problems. <gloss target="#t_AMH_1">AMH</gloss> will speak “very frankly” to the President about this
                        today.</p>

                        get more involved beyond the original high-level contact the new matters
                        should be taken care of at the Exec. Assistant level, and not at the

                        the Secretary’s absence. <gloss target="#t_AMH_1">AMH</gloss> was busy
                        preparing for today’s Congressional testimony. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName> had just returned from California where he had

                        Polish activity. Walessa (Solidarity leader) had twice walked out of union
                        councils on the strike issue. <persName corresp="#p_SRI_1">Spiers</persName>
                        noted that this was like a Greek tragedy with each actor playing out his own
                        role, and slowly rolling toward disaster. The Soyuz ’81 military exercises
                        are scheduled to end tomorrow, and <persName corresp="#p_SRI_1">Spiers</persName> noted that they no longer pose the real threat. In
                        his view, the danger lies in the enactment of martial law by the Polish
                        authorities, a possibility which <persName corresp="#p_SRI_1">Spiers</persName> thinks is very likely. He sees the crisis as going to
                        the brink and back too many times.</p>

                        Raised the issue of the <gloss target="#t_SNIE_1">SNIE</gloss> (Special
                        National Intelligence Estimate) on Soviet Terrorism Support. (Note: this was
                        requested in January by <gloss target="#t_AMH_1">AMH</gloss> after he read
                            <gloss target="#t_INR_1">INR</gloss>’s piece on same.) <persName corresp="#p_NPH_1">Paul</persName> says that it is disastrous—typical
                        double-fisted <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> analysis. He noted that
                        it uses the Soviet “terms of discourse”. That is, it distinguishes between
                        support for wars of national liberation, and support for terrorism. It is
                        couched in the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s usual “yes, but”
                        approach, and the only thing that media will pick up on is the “buts”. Even
                        though it is classified “codeword” all expect it to get out.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_SRI_1">Spiers</persName> noted that the facts are ok
                        (though there are not many of them), it is the conclusions that spoil the
                        work. <persName corresp="#p_NPH_1">Paul</persName> asked why the agency did
                        not produce just facts, why did they have to fog it up with analysis.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName> suggested that more State
                        people take a look at it, and try to change it. <persName corresp="#p_SRI_1">Spiers</persName> cautioned that changing an <gloss target="#t_SNIE_1">SNIE</gloss> to reflect policy preferences is very risky, and he
                        doubted that other agencies would go along with that.</p>
                    <p>Bud asked if <persName corresp="#p_CWJ_1">Casey</persName> had seen it—he
                        couldn’t imagine that <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss> would sell a bad
                        piece. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_CWJ_1">Casey</persName> is not always with it, and is almost
                        asleep at many <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meetings. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName> then convened a round table on the
                        piece for this afternoon, to include <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>, Wolf<pb n="91" facs="0122" xml:id="pg_91"/>owitz,

                        piece with an eye towards attaching a dissent, or delaying production, since
                        we asked for the <gloss target="#t_SNIE_1">SNIE</gloss> in the first

                    <p>1. (S—Entire text.)</p>
                    <p>2. The Secretary met with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> on
                        March 24. This cable provides a summary of the meeting for addressees’

                    <p>3. Summary of discussion: <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        asserted that some of the Soviet leaders are nervous and unhappy over recent
                        US rhetoric. He tried to portray <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> as good and experienced leader who has urged his
                        colleagues to remain calm and has thus-far prevented a harsh Soviet
                        response. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> emphasized the
                        importance of maintaining a dialogue and asked whether the Secretary
                        intended to hold the customary meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> at the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> in
                        September. The Secretary said that he did not know why the bilateral should
                        not take place but made no firm commitment. The Secretary suggested that he
                        and <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> continue the dialogue
                        possibly through another meeting as <pb n="92" facs="0123" xml:id="pg_92"/>early as next week. These meetings should be seen as regular, recurring
                        diplomatic contacts.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> tried to place the
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> “concession” on
                        extension of the geographic scope of European CBMS to the Urals in the
                        context of seeking ways to reach understanding with the US.<note n="3" xml:id="d35fn3">A reference to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s proposal to extend confidence-building
                            measures to include all of the Soviet Union west of the Urals.</note>
                        The Secretary suggested that the <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> statement could be judged positively if it was
                        meant to apply to the continent of Europe. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> replied that it also must pertain in some way to
                        the US and hinted that the Soviets would seek some way to cover US
                        reinforcements to Europe as the quid pro quo for their Atlantic to the Urals
                        “concession.”</p>
                    <p>5. During a discussion of Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> indicated in very vague terms that the Soviets were
                        ready to commit themselves to withdrawing their forces from Afghanistan but
                        offered no time frame. (There was nothing in <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s comments on Afghanistan to indicate a shift in
                        the Soviet position that their troops will be withdrawn when the reasons for
                        their presence have been resolved, e.g. cessation of “external
                        interference,” and there has been normalization of relations between <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> and its neighbors in Iran and Pakistan,
                        and international guarantees that “interference” will not be resumed.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> indicated that the Soviets
                        are eager to get back into the Middle East negotiation process, citing
                        proximity of the area to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s
                        Southern border. He stressed that <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        must be involved but had no specific recommendations for an appropriate
                        Soviet role. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> referred to
                        reports that the Secretary would seek to promote a Middle East/Southwest
                        Asia security consensus during his upcoming trip to the area. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> took issue with this alleged US
                        objective on the ground that it put regional events into an East/West focus
                        and seemed to involve exclusion of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> from a role in the area.</p>
                    <p>7. The Secretary stressed our concern about the continuing Cuban military
                        presence in Africa and the Libyan intervention in Chad. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> replied that the Cubans remain in
                        Africa because their African hosts continue to want them. He acknowledged
                        that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> sells arms to Libya, but he
                        claimed that Moscow has no control over Libyan use of the hardware. In
                        response to the Secretary’s expression of concern about signs of Soviet
                        support for the Libyan effort in Chad, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> denied any Soviet involvement.</p>
                    <p>8. The Secretary gave <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> our
                        views on the Polish debt situation, emphasizing that the Soviets must do
                        their fair share in helping Poland meet its debt burden and other economic
                        problems. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> had no
                        reaction.</p>
                    <pb n="93" facs="0124" xml:id="pg_93"/>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked the Secretary for
                        his opinion of the Soviet proposal for a moratorium on <gloss target="#t_LRTNF_1">LRTNF</gloss> deployments in Europe. The Secretary
                        replied that he thought the idea was “outrageous”.</p>
                    <p>10. The Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that
                        the US is consulting with its allies and we expected to be able to send a
                        reply to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> letter soon.<note n="4" xml:id="d35fn4">See <ref target="#d26">Document 26</ref>.</note> In this
                        connection, the Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that we intend to keep talking, but that Soviet
                        actions will speak louder than words. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that the Soviets were not pressing for an
                        early summit and agreed that such a meeting should be carefully
                        prepared.</p>
                    <p>11. Talking points</p>
                    <p>—The Secretary met with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> March
                        24 for a discussion on a number of matters. We expect that such meetings
                        will continue in the future as a means of maintaining the US–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> dialogue to which we are committed.</p>
                    <p>—Because there will be regular, recurring diplomatic contacts it may not be
                        productive or necessary to provide a formal read-out of each meeting. This
                        in no way diminishes our commitment to close consultations with our allies
                        on East/West matters.</p>
                    <p>—The Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> discussed
                        the possibility of a <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> bilateral at the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> did not press for a summit and agreed that such a
                        meeting should be carefully prepared.</p>
                    <p>—The Secretary rejected Soviet proposal for a moratorium on <gloss target="#t_LRTNF_1">LRTNF</gloss> deployments and told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that the <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> statement on CBMS was positive
                        development if it was meant to apply to the continent of Europe. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> implied that Soviets expected
                        extension of geographic scope to apply in some way to the US. (With Quad
                        allies only, addressees may explain that <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> referred to coverage of US reinforcement of Europe
                        in context of CBMS discussion.</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> referred to Soviet
                        willingness to withdraw from Afghanistan but offered no time frame and
                        indicated no flexibility in Soviet position on conditions that would make
                        withdrawal possible.</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> indicated that Soviets are
                        anxious to become involved in Middle East peace process but had no specific
                        recommendation for a Soviet negotiating role.</p>
                    <p>—The Secretary made clear our concern over continuing Cuban military role in
                        Africa and Libyan intervention in Chad. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> claimed that African hosts continue to desire Cuban
                        presence and claimed that Moscow has no control over Libyan use of Soviet
                        arms. He denied that Soviets are supporting Libyan effort in Chad.</p>
                    <pb n="94" facs="0125" xml:id="pg_94"/>
                    <p>—The Secretary raised our concerns about current situation in Poland and need
                        for Soviets to do their fair share to help Poland with its economic and debt
                        problems. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> did not
                        respond.</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> expressed interest in reply
                        to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s letter to President
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>, and the Secretary
                        responded that reply would be sent after we concluded consultations with our
                        allies. He told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that the US
                        wanted dialogue to continue, and progress in US-Soviet relations, but
                        reminded him that we intend to judge Soviet intentions by their actions, not
                        just words.</p>

                    <p>7. (S/NF) Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> then raised
                        the issue of <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>. He said he had two major
                        issues in this regard that he wanted to address: linkage of <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>; and the pace of any such talks with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the former point, he said that, especially in light of the upcoming
                            <gloss target="#t_SCG_1">SCG</gloss>,<note n="2" xml:id="d36fn2">A
                            reference to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s Special
                            Consultative Group, chaired by <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName>, which met in Brussels in the spring of 1981
                            to discuss ways to implement <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s
                            dual track decision of 1979. See John Vinocur, “U.S. Assures Allies It

                        the Soviets, we would lose any <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>
                        modernization plans we had. In this regard he felt that it would be
                        important to link <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> with <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Richard
                            Burt</persName> commented that <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        long ago had agreed that <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> should be
                        handled in the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> context. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> raised the question
                        of whether we had to link <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> since we have told people that we have no
                        objections to negotiations on both—it was just a matter of when and what the
                        agenda was going to be. Ikle then commented that, in his discussions with
                            Apel,<note n="3" xml:id="d36fn3">Reference is to West German Minister of
                            Defense Hans Apel.</note> he (Apel) had indicated that the Germans
                        wanted a good <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> agreement within the
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> context and that this was part of
                        the German theology regarding “decoupling.” <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> suggested that there was no reason to challenge <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> within the framework of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, especially if we are loose regarding
                        the specific linkage. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> indicated that we still have the problem of what
                        to do in the event the Soviets invaded Poland. If we are talking about the
                        linkage of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> as just a formulation, fine; but he did
                        not want to do anything that would delay deployment. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> responded that what he saw as the
                        problem was the need to manage and control <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>. There seemed to be general agreement that whereas <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> would not be taken up as part of a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> discussion, <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> would be “linked” to <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        in that it would be handled in a bilateral forum between the United States
                        and the Soviet Union, and we would purposely keep vague the relationship
                        between the two.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> then mentioned the second issue,
                        that of the pace of such talks with the Soviets. He said that there were
                        essentially two schools of thought: one indicated we should hold back on
                        pursuing such a dialogue until much more had been done in the modernization
                        field; the other indicated we should move as rapidly as possible in order to
                        engage the Soviets in a dialogue. <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> interjected that after the 31 March <gloss target="#t_SCG_1">SCG</gloss> we would need to tell the Allies whether
                        and when we were going to be talking with the Soviets. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> indicated that he had some
                        confusion with regard to this; specifically, he was concerned about what the
                        agenda would be in any dialogue with the Soviets. He restated his position
                        that we should not really sit down to talk just for talk’s sake; we should
                        not talk unless we had a clear idea of what it was we wanted to talk about
                        and it was clear we were not going to be giving something up just to engage
                        in a dialogue. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> indicated his
                        concern was that we might get too heroic in dealing with our Allies on this
                        matter and we might lose them on the <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>
                        modernization issue.</p>
                    <pb n="96" facs="0127" xml:id="pg_96"/>
                    <p>8. (S/NF) Related to this <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> issue,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> mentioned the results
                        of some of his recent discussions with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d36fn4">See
                                <ref target="#d35">Document 35</ref>.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> told him he felt they had
                        made a major new constructive proposal on the <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> issue by offering to include the Urals in the area for
                        discussion (noting that this would also be stretched all the way to the
                        United States). <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> said he had
                        replied that if they were talking about confidence-building measures for
                        anything west of the shoreline of Europe, the Soviets could forget it.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> then made reference to the
                        draft letter of response to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        which was in the White House—Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> indicated that Defense was totally unaware of any
                        draft response.<note n="5" xml:id="d36fn5">See <ref target="#d37">Document
                                37</ref>.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> then said he would ensure that
                        a copy was provided to us after the breakfast.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> then asked what
                        more was learned from <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s meeting
                        with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> responded that the Soviets were very
                        paranoid regarding our policy in the Middle East, especially the President’s
                        statement that we might consider helping the Afghan insurgents. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> had also reacted rather negatively
                        toward our discussion about increasing the U.S. presence in the region (he
                        even implied that the Soviets would be forced to react, making clear the
                        reference to Iran). As additional indication of his concern, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> even suggested that the Soviets
                        were interested in talking about these issues. Regarding this latter point
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> made reference to
                        Vance’s offer of 1977 that we should open up the Middle East talks to the
                        Soviets in Geneva. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> made a
                        general comment that obviously the policy being stated by the President was
                        causing them concern; therefore, we were making the right moves. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> also indicated that <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> was generally concerned with our
                        own push for the <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> modernization. (At
                        this point <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> suggested that
                        Defense should undertake to provide a good analysis of all long-range
                        theater nuclear force systems, comparing ours with the Soviets, etc.)</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> then asked
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> if he planned to have
                        continued discussions with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> said that he did, but that
                        these were to be just talks, nothing more. He said that he had told
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that there was no
                        prospect for a summit until the Soviets had demonstrated better behavior. He
                        further said that he had advised <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that we had great concern with <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> and with Castro. On <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>, in response to <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s expressed concern and indication we
                        were going to have to do something about it, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> did not blink at all. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> took this as an indication that the Soviets would not
                        attempt to interfere in anything that we felt was necessary to do. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> did say, however, <pb n="97" facs="0128" xml:id="pg_97"/>that <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> seemed less comfortable with any suggestion that we
                        might do something with regard to Cuba.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> asked if
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> had talked about El Salvador.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> responded that they had and
                        that things were a little bit better for us since the recent Colombian
                        actions with regard to Cuba (i.e., the withdrawal of the Ambassador).</p>
                    <p>9. (S/NF) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName>, referring to
                        the remarks <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had made on Libya,
                        said that he had some worry regarding Sadat and what he was likely to do. He
                        said that any action undertaken by Sadat against <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> would face us with some rather major decisions.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> agreed and said that if
                        anything was undertaken, we will need a very firm U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>-French response that we would not let the
                        Soviets intervene. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName>
                        indicated this would be a major decision and something that would need
                        addressing by the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> said that there still existed
                        the problem of dealing with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>.
                        He said that he would be meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> next fall and he suggested (to <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>) that the U.S. would probably go
                        ahead with this meeting, but it would be dependent on the international
                        scene and Soviet behavior. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                        further indicated the Soviets are very concerned that such a meeting might
                        not take place.</p>
                    <p>10. (C/NF) <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> indicated that there
                        was also a problem related to the grain embargo. He said people at the White
                        House were coming more into agreement with <persName corresp="#p_BWE_1">William Brock</persName> at Agriculture and that the people putting the
                        pressure on the President to lift the grain embargo had no sense of foreign
                        affairs. He indicated he believed what we are seeing is a case of
                        politicians driving the people rather than the other way around, that there
                        really was not much pressure within the body politic to lift the embargo. He
                        said that he had suggested the President check with the Congressional
                        leadership on this, especially <persName corresp="#p_BHH_1">Howard
                            Baker</persName>. His sense was that the leadership would indicate we
                        had much more to lose than to gain by lifting the grain embargo. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> suggested that the
                            <gloss target="#t_IG_1">IG</gloss> on East-West trade really needed to
                        get going in order to establish the policy and the importance of the grain
                        embargo.</p>

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> convened a meeting
                        of the National Security Council in the Cabinet Room of the White House on
                        March 26, 1981. The meeting lasted from 2:05 to 3:05 p.m. and covered
                        Poland, Nicaragua, and Central America. Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> noted that “the State Department had
                        reached the independent judgment that we were witnessing the most serious
                        crisis in Poland” since the coal miners’ strike of the previous summer.
                        Citing a “confidential source who is a former White House official,”
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> declared there was a
                        “strong possibility” of “an internal takeover by the Polish militia.” He
                        informed the group that the Polish Central Committee was scheduled to meet
                        on Sunday, March 29, and that the Polish Parliament was scheduled to meet in
                        an emergency session on Monday, March 30. A “major move by Polish, and
                        possibly Soviet forces, could occur on Monday,” according to <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>. (Reagan Library, Executive

                    <p>Following the meeting of the National Security Council on March 26, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> met with Executive Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLP_1">Bremer</persName>, Assistant Secretary of

                        and Special Assistant <persName corresp="#p_BR_1">Baltimore</persName>.
                        According to <persName corresp="#p_BR_1">Baltimore</persName>’s memorandum
                        to the files, they agreed that Assistant Secretary of State for Economic,
                        Energy and Business Affairs <persName corresp="#p_HRD_1">Hormats</persName>
                        would draft a statement regarding the grain embargo and work with Senate
                        Majority Leader <persName corresp="#p_BHH_1">Baker</persName>. “The
                        statement should mention that the decision to lift the grain embargo and
                        negotiate a new contract with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        depends upon Soviet international behavior.” <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> added that “the statement must not be released without
                        conferring with the Allies and giving them a full explanation of what it is
                        about,” and that the administration should wait until April 4, when the
                        Soviet “Soyuz” exercise was scheduled to conclude. (Library of Congress,

                        that day, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName> sent Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s March 25 draft of a Presidential

                        no interest in locking horns with State over this issue, but I do not

                            number])</note> We covered much of the same material as before although
                        he made some interesting comments on arms control and on Cuba.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Poland:</hi> I told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that the Poles were asking us for considerable
                        economic help. This would be more difficult for us because the Soviets did
                        not appear to be doing as much as they could on the economic front.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> agreed with my estimate
                        that in the short term the situation there was perhaps somewhat improved
                        although the longer-term outlook was more serious. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> repeated that if the Soviets felt
                        they had to move into Poland, they would move.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Arms Control:</hi> In response to his question, I confirmed
                        that we will put negotiations on European Theater Nuclear Forces ahead of
                        renewed discussions on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, which was a
                        complicated subject and needed considerable study. The Ambassador suggested
                        we might seek to negotiate selective arms control measures instead of trying
                        for a comprehensive <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement. He
                        referred specifically to the possibility of mutual agreements on submarine
                        construction and missile modifica<pb n="100" facs="0131" xml:id="pg_100"/>tions, holding that this “step-by-step” approach in specific functional
                        areas might have a better chance of success. He repeated that the Soviets
                        are not pressing for summitry but added that perhaps a functional arms
                        control accord could be signed at a summit. I told him we would want to
                        reflect carefully on what he had said but that progress even on selective
                        arms control issues will be difficult without concrete evidence of Soviet
                        worldwide restraint.</p>

                    <p>Information available to me indicates a growing possibility that the Soviet
                        Union is preparing to intervene militarily in Poland.<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">Documentation on Poland is scheduled for publication in
                                <ref target="frus1977-80v07">

                            1977–1981</ref>.</note> I wish to make clear to you the seriousness with
                        which the United States would view such an action, to which we would be
                        compelled to respond. I take this step not to threaten the Soviet Union, but
                        to ensure that there is no possibility of your misunderstanding our position
                        or our intentions.</p>
                    <p>It should be clear that the consequences of Soviet military intervention in
                        Poland on U.S.-Soviet relations would be very serious. Our ties to the
                        Polish people are strong and long-standing. A move against Poland would call
                        into question those elements of the U.S.-Soviet relations left intact
                        following your invasion of Afghanistan. Prospects for renewed progress to
                        reduce strategic and other arms would be dealt a serious and lasting
                        blow.</p>
                    <p>The impact in the broader international arena would be no less serious.
                        East-West relations are already strained by Afghanistan. As <pb n="102" facs="0133" xml:id="pg_102"/>last December’s <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Foreign Ministers meeting made clear, Soviet intervention
                        in Poland would mean the end of the process of detente in Europe as it has
                        developed over the past decade.<note n="3" xml:id="d39fn3">See <ref target="#d37">Document 37</ref>.</note> More generally the
                        unprecedented tension which would accompany a move against Poland would
                        complicate efforts to deal with sensitive international issues in ways which
                        avoid direct confrontation and preserve the peace.</p>
                    <p>Our policy toward Poland is one of noninterference. We have pursued such a
                        policy in word and deed. There is no threat to Soviet interests arising from
                        Western activities in that country.</p>
                    <p>Poland’s internal economic and political difficulties are real. We stand
                        prepared with the rest of the world community to help appropriately in
                        resolving them. With patience and a willingness on both sides to avoid
                        confrontation, we believe it remains possible to reach a solution acceptable
                        to all parties. But such a solution can only emerge if the Poles remain free
                        to address their difficulties without external pressures.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, our two nations share a unique responsibility to refrain from
                        actions which might threaten world peace. It is our hope that the Soviet
                        Union will recognize the importance of continuing to deal with the situation
                        in Poland in a manner consistent with its international
                        responsibilities.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>In connection with your communication of April 4,<note n="2" xml:id="d40fn2">See <ref target="#d39">Document 39</ref>.</note> I am bound to state at
                        the outset, that in our opinion, its content and its form serve <pb n="103" facs="0134" xml:id="pg_103"/>no useful purpose either at the level of
                        Soviet-American relations or from the point of view of the normalization of
                        the situation in Poland.</p>
                    <p>In fact, it repeats again the motif of imaginary “threats” to Poland on the
                        part of the Soviet Union which already for an extended time have been tossed
                        from one American announcement to another.</p>
                    <p>The more frequently such statements are made the more apparent becomes their
                        true character. It is doubtful that anyone can be deceived by them. Already
                        for a long time—practically from the beginning of the well-known internal
                        events in Poland—it was precisely the United States, and the Administration
                        itself, that has applied crude pressure on the situation in Poland and, in
                        essence, interfered in the internal affairs of that country.</p>
                    <p>When in Washington, at the very highest official levels, there are issued
                        public “warnings” to the Polish People’s Republic against the adoption of
                        measures to stop the actions of those who strive to throw the country into
                        anarchy and at the same time, in no unmistakable terms, there are threats of
                        some kinds of punishments, we are faced not just with interference but with
                        open incitement to the continuation of disorders and disobedience of
                        legitimate authority. By virtue of what right is this done?</p>
                    <p>And is it necessary to recall what is being done for the support of
                        anti-government elements in Poland by way of American secret services and
                        other organizations, particularly through the radio broadcasts to that
                        country by stations which are controlled by the U.S. government? It is no
                        secret that the same purposes are served also by the pseudo-humanitarian
                        assistance to particular groups in Poland on the part of certain American
                        trade unions.</p>
                    <p>Actions of this kind are impermissible in relations between sovereign states.
                        The <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>, after all, has also signed the
                        United Nations Charter which gives no one the right to interfere in the
                        internal affairs of other countries. And in how many authoritative
                        international documents since the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter
                        have the governments of the world decisively expressed themselves in favor
                        of this principle, hallowed by centuries, which no one is allowed to
                        trample?</p>
                    <p>We wish directly to warn the United States of America: do not interfere in
                        the internal affairs of Poland. If Washington genuinely desires that life in
                        Poland return as soon as possible to normal—as is declared there, from time
                        to time—then one should act accordingly.</p>
                    <p>As concerns the happenings in Poland, we have proceeded and continue to
                        proceed from the collective position of the states of the Warsaw Pact,
                        which, we assume, is known to you.</p>
                    <p>It should be clear that socialist Poland which, together with its allies, is
                        a member of the organization of the Warsaw Pact, is going to <pb n="104" facs="0135" xml:id="pg_104"/>be protected from all assaults from the
                        outside on its prevailing system, from all claims of external powers to
                        intervene in the solution of its internal affairs.</p>
                    <p>And one more thing. In your communication you make an attempt to link the
                        internal events in Poland with international problems and to issue some kind
                        of warnings on that subject. In this connection one can only express regret
                        that in Washington, apparently, there is inadequate awareness of the truth
                        that any positive achievement can be only the result of the mutual wish of
                        the parties. In the solution of international problems, whether these be
                        questions of European security or arms limitation, all states must be
                        equally interested, including the US, and no one may assume that here one
                        can punish someone else without first punishing himself.</p>
                    <p>Of course, I am decidedly not in agreement with the manner in which in your
                        communication you interpret the Afghanistan question. Our point of view on
                        this question, we have expressed more than once (word garbled) is scarcely
                        necessary to do this again.</p>
                    <p>If one is to touch on the American position in regard to Afghanistan then it
                        is clearly reflected in such facts as the recent public announcement of the
                        intention of <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> to provide weapons to the
                        interventionists and terrorists who are sent into Afghanistan, as well as
                        the pressure exerted by the US on Pakistan for the purpose of preventing the
                        opening of an Afghanistan-Pakistan dialogue with which we sympathize and
                        which would open the way to a political solution of the problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, I have frankly given you our position on the questions which
                        you have raised. We are indeed ready to discuss any problems which may
                        arise. It seems, however, that it would be counterproductive and not in the
                        interests of our two countries to reduce everything to mutual recriminations
                        and accusations. The situation in the world is such that there is a pressing
                        necessity for a constructive dialogue for the purpose of locating mutually
                        acceptable solutions of the world’s unresolved problems. This also applies
                        to Soviet-American relations.</p>

                    <p>As part of the Administration’s effort to focus attention on Soviet
                        international conduct and to bring about Soviet restraint, there is a
                        particular need to collect and disseminate information on Soviet subversive
                        activities around the world. And we need to urge other governments to
                        counter Soviet operations. <hi rend="italic">This memo sets forth a precis
                            of our current planning to structure an action program to expose the
                            extent of <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> and other Soviet Bloc
                            subversion</hi>. We request your approval for the general thrust of our
                        efforts.</p>
                    <p>A broad effort might include the following elements:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Information:</hi> We need a better fix on the dimensions
                        of the problem in order to provide case-study evidence of the potential
                        consequences for nations tolerating Soviet intelligence and subversive
                        activities within their borders. Particular attention could be paid to
                        Soviet penetration of intellectual movements, trade unions, peace and church
                        groups in Europe and elsewhere.</p>

                    <p>We then can develop classified and unclassified materials, and communicate
                        our intelligence through a variety of channels. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> is doing some of this already, but they could use

                        appropriate. The global nature of the Soviet threat would be important;
                        e.g., Pakistan’s recent action limiting Soviet intelligence activities might
                        be having an effect on Bangladesh President Zia, whom we have long been
                        urging to take similar actions in his own country. Furthermore, a
                        coordinated worldwide effort would tend to give credibility to assurances
                        many governments would seek from us that they would not be alone if the
                        Soviets reacted punitively.</p>

                        seriousness about the Soviet threat inside the U.S. if we are to be credible
                        in urging other nations to take action. We are vulnerable to criticism given
                        the scale of Soviet intelligence activities permitted in the U.S. Passage of
                        the Foreign Missions Act would give us one specific action to cite. Through
                        the <gloss target="#t_ICCUSA_1">ICCUSA</gloss> mechanism, a range of
                        measures are being taken or are under study to ensure strict reciprocity in
                        our bilateral relations with the Soviets. Many of these measures have direct
                        relevance to Soviet intelligence activities in the U.S.—such as stricter
                        limitation of travel by Soviet diplomats, <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        Missions officers, and visitors; and monitoring of Soviet contacts and
                        access in the U.S. In the event of Soviet intervention in Poland we and our
                        allies would consider major reductions of Soviet diplomatic and commercial
                        personnel in our countries.</p>

                        Room. We intend to prevent leaks on this one. The participants in the

                            <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>; <persName corresp="#p_GR_1">Robert Gates</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CWJ_1">Bill Casey</persName>’s special assistant on the Soviet Union; Mose

                    <p>There was consensus among the participants on the important points.</p>
                    <p>• The text appears to have been drafted by staffers in the Kremlin, with
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> himself adding several
                        personal themes. It is, therefore, both an institutional and a personal
                        response to your message of April 3, 1981.<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">See

               </p>
                    <p>• The tone of the letter is deliberately tough, but <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> has sent tougher letters to your
                        predecessors. The letter does not contain <pb n="108" facs="0139" xml:id="pg_108"/>any personal attacks on your actions, such as there
                        have been in past similar messages.</p>
                    <p>• The purpose of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s message
                        seems to be two-fold: First, to make a direct appeal to you for the
                        resumption of a US–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> dialogue, which
                        the Soviets badly want. Second, to establish a rationale for Soviet
                        intervention in Poland by blaming it on the United States.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets want talks with your Administration to legitimize their status as
                        the other, equal superpower, and because when they talk with the U.S. on
                        important issues such as <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, they can
                        pursue aggressive initiatives elsewhere in the world with less chance of
                        adverse publicity and public censure. The Soviets feel that in a few months
                        they will be able to engage this Administration in dialogue as they have its
                        predecessors, with the same success in improving their position in the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>In replying, you will want to consider carefully the impression you will
                        leave with <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> and his
                        colleagues. Indeed, as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Weiss</persName> put it, “the impression may be more important than the
                        substantive content” of your reply. I believe that your response will, in
                        fact, set the tone of U.S.-Soviet relations for a year or more, or at least
                        until you agree to a face-to-face meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Two major elements should be included in the reply, which it was agreed,
                        should be short and dignified. First, the tone of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s message was “unworthy” of a
                        statesman; was uncalled for, in view of the measured tone of your message to
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>; and hurt rather than
                        helped prospects for constructive Soviet-American discussions. Second, the
                        United States should reject the contention in <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s message that the Soviet Union, with its Warsaw
                        Pact allies, has a right to intervene in Polish affairs, whether on the
                        basis of the “<persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine” or
                        on any other basis.</p>
                    <p>Concerning the method of response, two alternatives were discussed. Either a
                        reply could be conveyed by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>, including a written text (in order to ensure that
                        the message makes it to Moscow without <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s reinterpretation), or a letter could be signed by
                        you, but sent through normal diplomatic channels, rather than on the “hot
                        line.” We do not wish to get into an extended exchange of messages via this
                        hot line channel.</p>
                    <p>We should share the gist of the messages with at least the four major allies
                        (Britain, France, Germany and Japan). We are pledged to consultation on
                        important matters, and it is the allies that are pressuring us for dialogue
                        with the Soviets. It may be useful for them to experience the tough,
                        insulting and uncompromising tone of the Soviet leader with whom we are
                        expected to converse.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>I have no way of verifying newspaper reports that we are about to lift the
                        grain embargo imposed on the Soviet Union.<note n="2" xml:id="d43fn2">See,
                            for instance, Lou Cannon, “<persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Prepared to Lift Embargo On Grain to Soviets,”
                                <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>, April 18, 1981, p.
                            A1.</note> If true, this would be bad news in every respect, except
                        perhaps for the agrarian interests directly affected. (S)</p>
                    <p>The grain embargo has had some economic impact in that it has forced the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to purchase grain at inflated
                        prices, to go through elaborate and costly circumventing operations, and to
                        slaughter excess cattle. The Soviet Union wants to buy grain here because we
                        alone can assure it of adequate quantities and the shipping suited to
                        handling by Soviet ports. (S)</p>
                    <p>The economic dimension, however, is not the most important one. What really
                        matters are the political-psychological aspects. (C)</p>
                    <p>1. The embargo had been imposed as penalty for the invasion of Afghanistan.
                        The Russians have not only failed to withdraw from Afghanistan, but they
                        have refused even to discuss the matter. How seriously will the world take
                        our threats in the future if the Russians get away with this? (S)</p>
                    <p>2. How can we pressure our Allies to maintain embargoes now or later if we
                        lift the grain embargo? We will merely confirm their suspicion that we are
                        not serious or reliable, that if they hold out long enough we will fall in
                        line. The lifting of the grain embargo certainly will improve the chances of
                        the gas-pipe deal, now in trouble. (S)</p>
                    <p>3. As for the Russians, this will be the first indication to them that their
                        hunch had been right: the Republicans are a party of businessmen who may be
                        more anti-Communist than the Democrats but who, in the end, will always be
                        swayed by commercial considerations. The great ideological capital gained by
                        the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration in Moscow
                        will be largely dissipated as a result of this decision. (S)</p>
                    <pb n="110" facs="0141" xml:id="pg_110"/>
                    <p>The grain embargo is not a domestic issue: it is part of global strategy and
                        should be treated as such. (S)</p>
                    <p>I feel I had to get this off my chest. (U)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Middle East Trip:</hi> The Secretary began the meeting by
                        giving Amb. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> a briefing on
                        his recent trip to the Middle East and Europe.<note n="2" xml:id="d44fn2">From April 4 to 12, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                            traveled to Cairo, Jerusalem, Amman, Riyadh, Rome, Madrid, London,
                            Paris, and Bonn.</note> At the conclusion of his briefing the Secretary
                        turned to Lebanon and noted that he thought the situation there was vitally
                        important to the peace of the region. He told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that we are urging restraint on the Israelis and
                        suggested that the Soviets were obliged to do the same with respect to
                        Syria. The situation was extremely volatile, and in our view if the Israelis
                        were provoked they could take severe action. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> responded that the Syrians were prepared and would
                        in that case react. The Secretary said that we had seen what happened in the
                        past when the Syrians reacted.</p>

                        to set up a firm schedule for talks in New York when the Secretary meets

                        these were simply his ideas which had yet to be discussed with the
                        President, but he knew they were generally in line with the President’s
                        thinking.</p>

                            Letter:</hi> The Secretary told Amb. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> would soon receive a reply to his March 6 letter to
                        President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d44fn3">See <ref target="#d26">Document 26</ref>.</note> He
                        noted that the delay in the response was due to the assassination attempt.
                        The Secretary then referred to the brief exchange between the two Presidents
                        on Poland and said that in light of the tone of the Soviet response, he felt
                        it was best that the Soviet letter not be answered since it would only lead
                        to escalated rhetoric.<note n="4" xml:id="d44fn4">See <ref target="#d39">Documents 39</ref> and <ref target="#d40">40</ref>.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that our Government remained somewhat encouraged but
                        nonetheless wary about the Polish situation.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Embargo</p>
                    <p>Based on that analysis and the President’s own long-standing opposition to
                        the embargo, which he considered to be less than effective and counter to
                        what he would do in the future if faced with a similar situation, the
                        President had decided to announce that he would lift the embargo in the very
                        near future. He wanted the Soviets to be aware of this. Also, we would be
                        prepared to be responsive if the Soviets wished to purchase more than the 8
                        million tons allowed under the current long-term agreement. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked how much we had in mind, and
                        the Secretary responded certainly 2 million tons, perhaps more.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that once the embargo is lifted we would be prepared to
                        negotiate a new long-term agreement to replace the one that expires in
                        September. He told the Ambassador that it would be helpful to hear from him
                        by noon on Friday, April 24, on the amount of additional grain the Soviets
                        might want to buy this year, and he stated that although it was perhaps not
                        realistic to expect an answer on the long-term agreement by Friday, it would
                        also be helpful to know about that. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked if there were any conditions attached to this
                        decision. The Secretary stated that we were making this decision on our own
                        and there were no conditions.</p>

                    <p>4. (C/NF) The Secretary [<persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>]
                        then raised a short item having to do with licenses for pipelaying in the
                        Soviet Union. He mentioned he had received a letter recently from
                        Congressman <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">Michel</persName>
                  <note n="3" xml:id="d45fn3">Reference is to House Minority Leader <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">Bob Michel</persName> (R-Illinois). The letter
                            was not found.</note> requesting assistance in expediting licenses for a
                        company in his constituency so that they could continue their business with
                        the Soviets. The Secretary noted that there was an <gloss target="#t_IG_1">IG</gloss> currently on-going on the issue of export controls and he
                        indicated that his opinion was that we should not permit such licenses to go
                        forward and sought the support of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> indicated
                        that he, too, agreed that we should work to cut back on such export licenses
                        but indicated that he felt there would be a lot of problems
                        domestically.</p>
                    <p>5. (S/NF) This discussion on export controls and domestic problems led to the
                        issue of the Soviet grain embargo. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> said the embargo was going to be lifted. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> asked whether it could not be
                        done in phases. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> then described
                        the following sequence of events which had led up to the decision to cancel
                        the grain embargo: (1) There was a Lou Cannon story in the paper the
                        preceding Friday which indicated that the grain embargo was likely to be
                            lifted<note n="4" xml:id="d45fn4">See <ref target="#d43fn2">footnote 2,
                                Document 43</ref>.</note> (<persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> understood that this story derived from <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Ed Meese</persName>); (2) Upon reading this story,
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                        <pb n="113" facs="0144" xml:id="pg_113"/>called <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Meese</persName> and registered a complaint; (3) <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Malcolm Baldrige</persName>, the next day, was en
                        route to a Cable News Network interview when he read the story in the
                        paper—believing this to be true (when questioned on the subject during the
                        Cable News interview), he said we were going to be lifting the grain
                        embargo; (4) Upon hearing the interview, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> called <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName>
                        and asked him why he had made the statement and learned that it was simply
                        because he had assumed that what he had read in the paper had been the
                        decision; (5) On the preceding Tuesday,<note n="5" xml:id="d45fn5">April
                            14.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had met with <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Meese</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJA_1">Baker</persName> and a decision was arrived at that the embargo would
                        in fact be lifted; (6) <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> then met
                        with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> and advised
                        him that the grain embargo would be lifted since it was no longer in the
                        U.S. interest to maintain it and that <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> should advise him by tomorrow at noon if the
                        Soviets were going to want more grain during the coming year—he also
                        informed <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that the next time
                        any situation arose wherein Soviet behavior was outside acceptable norms,
                        the U.S. would hit them with everything we had.<note n="6" xml:id="d45fn6">See <ref target="#d44">Document 44</ref>.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> indicated that
                        it was his impression the embargo was just really beginning to hurt the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. He said it was unfortunate that
                        there had been a campaign promise made to lift the embargo and suggested
                        that it was even more unfortunate that there was an office devoted to ensure
                        that all campaign promises were kept. He then asked whether <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> appeared grateful for lifting the
                        embargo to which <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> responded in
                        the affirmative. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> then
                        asked whether the decision was in fact a fait accompli. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> responded that it was and that it
                        would be announced on Friday but the timing would be such so as not to
                        affect the commodity markets.</p>
                    <p>All agreed that it was too bad the decision had progressed the way it did on
                        the grain embargo. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName>
                        indicated that it was going to be sending a bad signal to everyone around
                        the world and the fact that the <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss> had
                        indicated the Soviets were no longer being hurt by the grain embargo did not
                        help the situation at all.</p>
                    <p>6. (S/NF) The Secretary then asked how the meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> went in general. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> responded that <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> really wants to sit and talk a
                        lot, especially on arms control. He further noted that <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> was very anxious in two areas: he
                        is interested in seeking ways that he can get us to reverse our defense
                        spending efforts; and he is interested in splitting us from our European
                        allies, especially on the arms control issues.</p>
                    <pb n="114" facs="0145" xml:id="pg_114"/>
                    <p>The discussion then turned to a general elaboration of how things stood
                        regarding the <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> issue. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> indicated that while <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> was very anxious to get the talks
                        going, he was less so than our European allies. With regard to the allies,
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> felt that he had to go
                        ahead and set some sort of a schedule. His (<persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s) scenario was to talk all summer regarding the data
                        (presumably with the Soviets). The Secretary indicated that we ought to take
                        as much time as necessary in order to talk with our allies. (At this point
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> asked if the Schmidt
                        visit was still on and <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> replied
                        that it was.)<note n="7" xml:id="d45fn7">Schmidt made an official visit to
                            Washington from May 20 to 23 and was hosted by <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> at a state dinner at the White
                            House on May 21. A memorandum of their conversation on May 22 is
                            scheduled for publication in <ref target="frus1981-88v07">

                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> indicated that, with regard to
                        the Schmidt visit, his pipeline was the German political leader Nau<note n="8" xml:id="d45fn8">Presumably a reference to Johannes Rau, Minister

                        attempted to claim that we (i.e., Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>) had said that the Germans could not have their
                        social programs. The Secretary indicated what he had told Schmidt was that
                        the United States had made some rather significant sacrifices in order to
                        beef up its defenses and he hoped the allies would be able to do the same.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> indicated he attempted
                        to explain this to Nau, but in many cases the Germans chose to interpret
                        things differently.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to the Soviet Union.]</p>
                    <p>The Secretary indicated his basic concurrence with this division of labor and
                        then asked whether the <gloss target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss> was making good

                                <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> should accentuate

                        <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> indicated that <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Rick Burt</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Larry Eagleburger</persName> were working on this with our people.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> indicated that he was
                        working closely with <persName corresp="#p_PR_1">Richard Perle</persName>
                        and that <persName corresp="#p_PR_1">Richard</persName> had participated in

                        on Friday<note n="10" xml:id="d45fn10">April 24.</note> which was going to
                        develop a paper for <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> consideration next

                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> went on to explain that the
                        basic position of the <gloss target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss> was that arms
                        control talks might begin by late this year if there was Alliance agreement
                        or consensus on two matters: (1) <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> and
                        linkage (both to <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and with respect to
                        Soviet behavior); and (2) the nature and extent of the Soviet threat. The
                        Secretary indicated he hoped our position would include some sort of a
                        termination clause if the Soviets <pb n="115" facs="0146" xml:id="pg_115"/>went into Poland or undertook some other form of unacceptable behavior.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> said that this was their
                        intent in developing a consensus on the linkage.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> indicated that we had to work
                        together on this arms control problem. The Secretary concurred but indicated
                        his concern about being hit by the allies for a specific date when these
                        things were going to be undertaken. He was additionally concerned that the
                        allies might continue to postpone actions or deployments if they got too
                        wrapped up in arms control—when it would start, etc. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> indicated he wanted to have things
                        pretty well set up so that during his normal meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> next fall, coincident with the
                        opening of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>, he would be able to
                        discuss when such talks might begin.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to the Soviet Union.]</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> then commented that <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Dick Allen</persName> (derived from <persName corresp="#p_PR_2">Richard Pipes</persName>) was putting out a line that
                        the Soviets had changed the <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        doctrine to include Cuba. He said that he had talked to <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> about this and <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> had indicated that the ’62
                        understandings were still valid and there was no change to the <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> doctrine. (He further indicated
                        that the <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> doctrine was a
                        U.S.-manufactured idea and the only protection that extended to Cuba was in
                        the event of an invasion by the U.S.)</p>

                            after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. “The State Department took my
                            draft of the letter and rewrote it, diluting some of my personal
                            thoughts with stiff diplomatic language that made it more impersonal
                            than I’d wanted,” the President recalled. “I didn’t like what they’d
                            done to it, so I revised their revisions and sent the letter largely as
                            I had originally written it; on April 24, 1981, two letters went out to

                        California at the time and you were concluding a series of meetings with
                        President Nixon. Those meetings had captured the imagination of all the
                        world. Never had peace and good will among men seemed closer at hand.</p>
                    <p>When we met I asked if you were aware that the hopes and aspirations of
                        millions and millions of people throughout the world were dependent on the
                        decisions that would be reached in your meetings.</p>
                    <p>You took my hand in both of yours and assured me that you were aware of that
                        and that you were dedicated with all your heart and mind to fulfilling those
                        hopes and dreams.</p>
                    <p>The people of the world still share that hope. Indeed the peoples of the
                        world, despite differences in racial and ethnic origin, have very much in
                        common. They want the dignity of having some control over their individual
                        destiny. They want to work at the craft or trade of their own choosing and
                        to be fairly rewarded. They want to raise their families in peace without
                        harming anyone or suffering harm themselves. Government exists for their
                        convenience, not the other way around.</p>

                    <p>If they are incapable, as some would have us believe, of self government,
                        then where among them do we find any who are capable of governing
                        others?</p>
                    <p>Is it possible that we have permitted ideology, political and economic
                        philosophies, and governmental policies to keep us from considering the very
                        real, everyday problems of our peoples? Will the average Soviet family be
                        better off or even aware that the Soviet Union has imposed a government of
                        its own choice on the people of Afghanistan? Is life better for the people
                        of Cuba because the Cuban military dictate who shall govern the people of
                        Angola?</p>
                    <p>It is often implied that such things have been made necessary because of
                        territorial ambitions of the United States; that we have imperialistic
                        designs and thus constitute a threat to your own security and that of the
                        newly emerging nations. There not only is no evidence to support such a
                        charge, there is solid evidence that the United States, when it could have
                        dominated the world with no risk to itself, made no effort whatsoever to do
                        so.</p>
                    <p>When World War II ended, the United States had the only undamaged industrial
                        power in the world. Our military might was at its peak—and we alone had the
                        ultimate weapon, the nuclear weapon, with the unquestioned ability to
                        deliver it anywhere in the world. If we had sought world domination then,
                        who could have opposed us?</p>
                    <p>But the United States followed a different course—one unique in all the
                        history of mankind. We used our power and wealth to rebuild the war-ravaged
                        economies of the world, including those nations who had been our enemies.
                        May I say there is absolutely no substance to charges that the United States
                        is guilty of imperialism or attempts to impose its will on other countries
                        by use of force.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, should we not be concerned with eliminating the obstacles
                        which prevent our people—those we represent—from achieving their most
                        cherished goals? And isn’t it possible some of those obstacles are born of
                        government objectives which have little to do with the real needs and
                        desires of our people?</p>
                    <p>It is in this spirit, in the spirit of helping the people of both our
                        nations, that I have lifted the grain embargo.<note n="4" xml:id="d46fn4">In

                    </opener>
                    <p>Thank you for your letter of March 6.<note n="2" xml:id="d47fn2">See <ref target="#d26">Document 26</ref>.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>Your letter raises many complex issues which obviously cannot be dealt with
                        in an exchange of correspondence, except in general terms. Please be assured
                        that our country is vitally interested in the peaceful resolution of
                        international tensions. This Administration is prepared to settle
                        disagreements by negotiations. We are also prepared to observe scrupulously
                        our international commitments.</p>
                    <p>At the same time I must be frank in stating my view that a great deal of the
                        tension in the world today is due to Soviet actions. As we and our allies
                        have repeatedly stated, two aspects of Soviet behavior are of particular
                        concern to us:</p>
                    <p>—First, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s unremitting and
                        comprehensive military buildup over the past 15 years, a buildup which in
                        our view far exceeds purely defensive requirements and carries disturbing
                        implications of a search for military superiority.</p>
                    <p>—Second, the Soviet Union’s pursuit of unilateral advantage in various parts
                        of the globe and its repeated resort to the direct and indirect use of
                        force.</p>
                    <p>These activities raise serious questions about the Soviet Union’s commitment
                        to the peaceful resolution of outstanding issues in accord with
                        international law, the “Basic Principles of Relations” concluded <pb n="119" facs="0150" xml:id="pg_119"/>between our two countries in Moscow in
                        1972, and the Helsinki Final Act.<note n="3" xml:id="d47fn3">Reference is to
                            the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>I believe that real progress in relations between our two countries is
                        possible and necessary. But my Administration is determined to judge Soviet
                        intentions on the basis of actions and demonstrated restraint.</p>
                    <p>This does not diminish our commitment to constructive dialogue. Effective and
                        meaningful communication between our two countries is absolutely essential.
                        I welcome your assurance that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        also believes in such a dialogue. We should work together to avoid
                        misunderstanding or miscalculation.</p>
                    <p>A personal meeting and a direct exchange of views would certainly be a useful
                        way of pursuing this dialogue at the appropriate time. Clearly, however, the
                        success of such a meeting would depend in large measure on careful
                        preparation and a propitious international climate. I do not believe that
                        these conditions exist at present, and so my preference would be for
                        postponing a meeting of such importance to a later date.</p>
                    <p>All Americans share your concern over the threat to mankind in the age of
                        nuclear weapons. I welcome your statement that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is prepared for discussions with the United States on
                        limiting strategic weapons. I have stated publicly that the United States is
                        ready to undertake discussions with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> that would lead to genuine arms reductions. We are
                        presently engaged in a review of arms control and as soon as this review is
                        completed we will be in touch with your Government.</p>
                    <p>Your acceptance of the principle that confidence-building measures should
                        apply throughout Europe, including all of the European portions of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, strikes me as encouraging. As
                        our delegation at the Madrid Review Conference has made clear, we support
                        France’s proposal for a meeting to negotiate a coherent system of measures
                        on European security: obligatory, verifiable and of military
                            significance.<note n="4" xml:id="d47fn4">See James M. Markham, “U.S.
                            Endorses Proposal by France For an Arms Parley After Madrid,” <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, February 18, 1981, p. A10.</note>
                        Soviet acceptance of these criteria would eliminate important obstacles to
                        the holding of a security meeting within the <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> framework as part of a balanced outcome from the Madrid
                        conference.</p>
                    <p>I am afraid, however, that I cannot be sanguine about your treatment of other
                        arms control issues, especially your proposal for a moratorium on
                        deployments of theatre nuclear forces in Europe.</p>
                    <pb n="120" facs="0151" xml:id="pg_120"/>
                    <p>At the time it took its December 1979 decision, <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> rejected the concept of a moratorium because it would
                        perpetuate existing Soviet superiority in long-range theatre nuclear forces.
                        The continuing deployment since then of Soviet SS–20 launchers targeted
                        against <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> has worsened the situation.
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> deploys no land-based missiles in
                        Europe that could reach territory of the Soviet Union. The reasoning that
                        prompted the Alliance to reject a moratorium in December 1979 is thus even
                        more persuasive today.</p>
                    <p>Further to our exchanges on Poland,<note n="5" xml:id="d47fn5">See <ref target="#d39">Documents 39</ref> and <ref target="#d40">40</ref>.</note> I must reject charges that the United States is
                        intervening in that country’s affairs. This is simply not true. As we have
                        repeatedly made clear, our concern is that the Polish Government and people
                        be allowed to resolve their problems peacefully and free from any outside
                        interference. In our view, recent Soviet military behavior and tendentious
                        propaganda amount to a threat of the use of force which represents
                        interference in Poland’s internal affairs.</p>
                    <p>In this connection I have noted with concern repeated statements by
                        responsible Soviet officials suggesting that the form of a country’s
                        political, social and economic system bestows upon the Soviet Union special
                        rights and, indeed, duties, to preserve a particular form of government in
                        other countries. I must inform you frankly and emphatically that the United
                        States rejects any such declaration as contrary to the charter of the United
                        Nations and other international instruments, including the Helsinki Final
                        Act. Claims of special “rights,” however defined, cannot be used to justify
                        the threat of force to infringe upon the sovereign rights of any country to
                        determine its own political, economic and social institutions.</p>
                    <p>I was disappointed that in your treatment of Afghanistan, the most important
                        element in the situation was not mentioned—the prompt withdrawal of Soviet
                        forces from that country. There is wide international agreement that the
                        Soviet military presence in Afghanistan is a major source of tension in the
                        area. Proposals for dealing with this by initiating a dialogue between
                        Pakistan and Afghanistan have been firmly rejected by the Pakistanis
                        themselves and by virtually all concerned nations since they fail to deal
                        with the central issue of Soviet withdrawal. Evidence that the Soviet Union
                        is prepared to move toward an acceptable resolution of the Afghanistan
                        problem on the basis of her prompt withdrawal would go far toward restoring
                        international confidence and trust necessary for the improvement of
                        East-West relations.</p>
                    <p>I have spoken frankly in order to convey to you my views and feelings, and
                        give you a clear sense of the basic foreign policies of <pb n="121" facs="0152" xml:id="pg_121"/>my Administration. The discussion initiated
                        in this exchange should continue through the full range of diplomatic
                        channels. If you agree, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> might meet for further exchanges on these and
                        related matters. The traditional meeting at the United Nations in September
                        may be an appropriate forum. Perhaps by that time a basis will exist not
                        only for deepening our bilateral dialogue, but for considering how and at
                        what pace we may begin to build a better and happier relationship.</p>

                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName> opened the meeting by
                        summarizing the issues for discussion: “The position the US should take on
                            <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> negotiations with the Soviet Union;
                        a brief word on Libya; U.S.-Japanese relations and the submarine and grain
                        embargo issues; and the East-West trade paper which the Secretary of State
                        will discuss while in Europe.” On the first issue, the Theater Nuclear
                        Forces negotiations, <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName> reviewed
                        “the capabilities of the Backfire bomber in its intra-theater role, the
                        SS–20, the SS–4, and the SS–5 missiles. He made the point that the SS–20,
                        the basic Soviet IRBM, has three warheads and will be deployed in warhead
                        numbers over 1,400 by 1985.” He then went over the capabilities of <pb n="122" facs="0153" xml:id="pg_122"/>U.S. Pershing-II and
                        ground-launched cruise missiles (<gloss target="#t_GLCM_1">GLCM</gloss>),
                        which, once deployed to North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, had
                        the potential to strike well within Soviet territory. The question at hand,
                        as <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName> put it, was whether to set
                        a date for <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> negotiations with the
                        Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Following <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName>’s remarks, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> summarized his discussions with
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Secretary General Lord
                        <persName corresp="#p_CLP_1">Carrington</persName>, British Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_TM_1">Margaret Thatcher</persName>, and West
                        German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, after which it “became apparent that
                        European leaders cannot maintain domestic consensus behind <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> modernization without a specific date for
                        the start of <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> negotiations.” There was a
                        sense among Europeans “that our modernization process has not been based
                        upon an honest threat assessment or military requirements study.” The
                        position of the Department of State was to “lay out a timetable to meet with
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> by the Fall and to
                        negotiate with the Soviets on <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> by the
                        end of the year.”</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> responded that the
                        Department of Defense “was not opposed in principle to negotiations or
                        discussion of timetables but felt that any negotiations with the Soviet
                        Union must be preceded by a common assessment of the threat and of our
                        requirements.” After some debate over the merits of setting a date to begin
                        negotiations, President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> “said
                        that he did not see much difference between State and <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> positions. We will conduct the studies; we
                        will continue to deploy modern systems; we believe the study can be done by
                        the end of the year, and look forward to negotiations in that time frame. We
                        will discuss with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> in the
                        Fall; if the studies are not ready by the end of the year, we will take that
                        into consideration.” <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Meese</persName> summarized
                        the position: “(1) Tell the Allies that we hope to start the talks by the
                        end of the year; (2) We will talk to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> in the Fall; (3) We need to start studies now; (4)
                        These studies will be the basis for our talks; (5) We must proceed with
                        modernization on schedule.” The participants then briefly discussed the
                        process for drafting an East-West trade paper and the situation in Lebanon.

                        2) These negotiations will be based on an up-to-date threat assessment and a

                        matters of immediate priority. 3) The negotiations will be conducted within

                        the burden in helping Poland and to our reference to Soviet intervention in
                        Poland and its consequences.</p>
                    <p>—Gave no assurances that the Soviet Union would urge restraint on Syria in
                        Lebanon and would not admit any Syrian responsibility for the present
                        crisis.</p>
                    <p>—Emphasized Soviet interest in nuclear non-proliferation and asked what
                        Indian response was to our approach on Indian preparation for an underground
                        nuclear test explosion.</p>
                    <p>—Had nothing to add to Soviet position on the Pentecostalists.</p>
                    <p>—Said (disingenuously) that Charge’s appearance on Soviet <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> would depend on whether Soviet media are
                        interested in extending an invitation. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. Charge called on First Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> morning of May 4 for discussion in accord with
                            <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>. Discussion of talking points
                        supplied by Department is summarized below.</p>
                    <p>U.S.-Soviet Dialogue</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> commented that the
                        Soviet Union’s views on a dialogue do not need any special comment in that
                        there can be no doubt that the Soviet Union is “for a dialogue” which would
                        be effective and deal with concrete questions. The Soviet Union, he said, is
                        not for a dialogue merely for the sake of a dialogue, but is interested in
                        one which will take both sides forward on the questions under discussion.
                        Concerning our statement that a meeting between Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> might take place in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> in the fall, <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> said that such meetings have become traditional.
                        However, he took exception to the “reservation” that such a meeting would
                        depend upon events between now and the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> and the international atmosphere which prevails at that
                        time. This was not a constructive approach, in his view, for such a meeting.
                        Charge observed that U.S. interest in a dialogue is serious and that our
                        statement simply reflects the fact that any meeting at that level is
                        obviously subject to international developments.</p>
                    <p>5. Concerning a summit meeting, <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> said that a Soviet response to President
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s letter will be
                        forthcoming in due course, and will deal with that part of the letter which
                        addresses a summit meeting. He added that it would be inappropriate for him
                        to anticipate the Soviet reaction at this time.</p>
                    <p>Afghanistan</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> commented that our
                        statement on Afghanistan was “not very understandable.” He reiterated the
                        standard Soviet position that Soviet troops will be withdrawn from
                        Afghanistan when the Government of Afghanistan requests the Soviet Union to
                        do so and when armed attacks against Afghan territory cease. “Until that
                        happens it is <pb n="125" facs="0156" xml:id="pg_125"/>not possible to
                        withdraw Soviet troops.” He said that of course <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> had not excluded the possibility of a Soviet
                        withdrawal, since the Soviet position had long been that it would withdraw
                        when “foreign intervention” in Afghanistan ceased and sufficient guarantees
                        were in place to preclude a resumption. The U.S., he said, can facilitate
                        this but is evidently doing the opposite. He then referred to what he
                        characterized as the President’s statement that the U.S. “will arm and
                        continue to arm Afghan counter revolutionaries.”</p>
                    <p>7. Charge pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>
                        had misquoted the President, since he had actually said that if Afghan
                        patriots asked us for assistance we would consider such a request. Charge
                        added that he felt the Soviets had no grounds for objecting to the
                        President’s statement since Soviet leaders make clear that they reserve the
                        right to aid “liberation movements” of their definition and choosing. Our
                        approach to the Soviet Union on this question, however, is not aimed at
                        winning debating points. The Soviet Union must understand that the situation
                        in Afghanistan plays a key role in U.S. public opinion and is a major factor
                        in our current difficulties. A solution must be found which addresses the
                        root issues—the presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan. Without progress
                        on this issue it will be very difficult to make substantial progress in
                        resolving other difficult issues on the U.S.-Soviet agenda.<note n="4" xml:id="d49fn4">

                            much of this paragraph, drew a checkmark at the end, and wrote in the

               </p>
                    <p>8. Picking up on this, <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>
                        asked why the U.S. was obstructing any step which can effectively settle the
                        problem “around Afghanistan.” Pakistan, he said, had been ready to approach
                        negotiations with Afghanistan in the presence of <gloss target="#t_UNSYG_1">UNSYG</gloss> or his representative, and Soviets know very well that
                        the U.S. put pressure on Pakistan not to enter into talks which could lead
                        to closing the Pakistan border to anti-Afghan activities. Charge made clear
                        that we are not opposed to negotiations directed at solving the root problem
                        and which are based on the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> resolution
                        of November 1980. The problem is that the Soviet Union has shown no
                        readiness to take this course, which has the approval of a majority of
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> members.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions are not always appropriate bases
                        for negotiations, and the U.S. implicitly recognized this when it refused to
                        implement the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> resolution on the
                        recognition of the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> as the exclusive
                        representative of the Palestinian people. He then reiterated his contention
                        that the U.S. had obstructed bilateral talks between Islamabad and Kabul,
                        and observed that the Soviets had con<pb n="126" facs="0157" xml:id="pg_126"/>cluded from this that the U.S. has no interest in solving the problem, but
                        wishes to drag it out.<note n="5" xml:id="d49fn5">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> wrote in the right-hand margin
                            next to paragraph 9: “Clearly a weak response to a strong U.S.
                            stance!”</note>
               </p>
                    <p>10. Charge pointed out that this conclusion was utterly false, since U.S. has
                        absolutely no interest in a perpetuation of the Soviet occupation of
                        Afghanistan—which is the real issue. The U.S. clearly will support steps
                        designed to resolve this problem, but they obviously must center on the
                        withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>Poland</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> commented as follows on
                        our talking points:</p>
                    <p>—Soviet economic assistance to Poland will be decided on a bilateral basis.
                        These decisions will be made much more expeditiously than they have been by
                        the West. Soviet assistance and the scale of Soviet assistance concerns only
                        the Polish leadership. Polish Deputy Prime Minister Jagielski informed the
                        U.S. officials during his trip to Washington of the scope of Soviet
                        assistance, therefore U.S. is aware of the volume of Soviet aid and knows
                        that it is substantial.<note n="6" xml:id="d49fn6">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> drew three vertical lines to the
                            right of this sentence and wrote: “not really!! their man didn’t <hi rend="italic">perform.</hi>”</note>
               </p>
                    <p>—Concerning the U.S. reference that the Soviet Union “must bear a much larger
                        share of the burden in helping Poland,” Soviets cannot accept the
                        implications and tone of this reference. This applies equally to the U.S.
                        reference to “Soviet intervention in Poland.” The Soviets have made their
                        position clear on this matter. If U.S. is talking about outside intervention
                        in Poland’s affairs, it is evident that it comes from the Western powers,
                        especially the U.S. The U.S. is trying to dictate to the Polish Government
                        what to do and not to do and to use economic assistance in a threatening
                        way. This is intervention.</p>
                    <p>12. Charge pointed out that it is not unreasonable to expect the Soviet
                        Union, as an ally of Poland, to carry its share of the burden of economic
                        assistance. Also, in no way can Western aid to Poland be construed as
                        interference. We are not forcing Poland to accept our aid. On the contrary.
                        The U.S. has a sovereign right to determine the conditions under which it
                        will extend aid, but wishes to make clear to all concerned the
                        considerations which will enter into our decisions.</p>
                    <p>India</p>
                    <p>13. Charge referred to the non-paper given <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> by the Secretary on April 1 concerning the Indian
                        underground nuclear explosion and added the additional points per <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">A. Korniyenko</persName> stated that the Soviet
                        Union’s basic position on nonproliferation was well known <pb n="127" facs="0158" xml:id="pg_127"/>and commented that it has been a subject
                        upon which both the U.S. and the Soviet Union have been in substantial
                        agreement. He asked what the Indian response was when we raised this matter
                        with them, and Charge said he had no information on this point. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> repeated that this is an area in
                        which we have a coincidence of views, and added, “we will return to this
                        question.”</p>
                    <p>Lebanon</p>
                    <p>14. Regarding Lebanon, <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>
                        referred to <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s response to
                        Undersecretary <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> and added
                        that what bothers the Soviet Union is the U.S. action in trying to “dictate”
                        to Syria how it should deploy its forces when it is acting under a mandate
                        by the Arab states. He then asked pointedly what right the U.S. has to issue
                        ultimatums in such a situation.</p>
                    <p>15. Charge replied that he was surprised by <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>’s questioning of U.S. right to convey its views
                        to the parties involved and by his characterization of this as an ultimatum.
                        It is clear that the U.S. is trying to defuse a dangerous situation, and
                        using its influence to this end in those quarters where it has influence.
                        Speaking personally, he found <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>’s question quite incomprehensible in view of the
                        provisions of the U.S.–U.S.S.R. 1973 Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear
                        War. The Soviet Union must recognize that the situation in Lebanon remains
                        dangerous and could spiral out of control if the Syrians do not restore the
                        status quo ante April 25.</p>
                    <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> acknowledged that the
                        situation in Lebanon is dangerous and even explosive and then went into a
                        lengthy monologue accusing the phalange, Haddad’s militia forces in the
                        south and Israeli aggressive acts into Lebanese territory as the major
                        causes for the sharpening crisis. Syrian acts in Lebanon, he concluded, are
                        in reaction to the acts of these other forces. Charge responded that U.S.
                        cannot accept the assertion that most of the responsibility rests with
                        Israel and the Christian forces in Lebanon and emphasized that what is
                        important now is not arguing over who is to blame but undertaking steps to
                        prevent a deterioration of the current situation.</p>
                    <p>Iran</p>
                    <p>17. On Iran, <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> adopted a
                        quizzical posture, saying that he did not understand why we were bringing
                        the subject up in this way. He added that the Soviet Union, “of course,” is
                        against interference in the affairs of other countries and that this applies
                        to Iran as much as Mexico.<note n="7" xml:id="d49fn7">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> underlined “as much as Mexico”
                            and wrote in the right-hand margin: “<persName corresp="#p_ETO_1">Tom
                                Enders</persName>—See me—we are making headway at last!”</note> But
                        they do not find it necessary to point this out without <pb n="128" facs="0159" xml:id="pg_128"/>cause. Charge pointed out that, given the
                        turmoil in Iran and the strained relations the U.S. now has with Iran, it is
                        quite appropriate to restate our position in this matter, lest there be any
                        misunderstanding. He then took the opportunity to ask, for the Embassy’s
                        information, what the Soviet position is on the Iranian abrogation of
                        Articles 5 and 6 of the 1921 Soviet-Iranian Treaty. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> replied that there had been no
                        Soviet response to the Iranian “declaration” on this subject.</p>
                    <p>Pentecostalists</p>
                    <p>18. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> said that the Soviets
                        had noted the President’s interest in this matter, but could add nothing to
                        what <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> had already provided on
                        the subject.<note n="8" xml:id="d49fn8">

                    <p>Access to Soviet Media by Charge</p>
                    <p>19. In conclusion, Charge mentioned that we continue to hope that Soviets
                        will arrange for a <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> appearance to answer
                        questions regarding U.S. policy. He pointed out that the frequent
                        appearances of Soviet representatives on U.S. media and failure to arrange
                        for a single U.S. appearance here left the unfortunate impression that
                        Soviets desired a monologue rather than a dialogue. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> replied that Soviet diplomats in
                        U.S. merely responded to invitations from the media, and if Soviet media
                        desired to invite the Charge for a similar appearance, <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> would not object. Charge observed that he
                        was sure that <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> could encourage such an
                        invitation if it wished.</p>

                    <p>Derek Leebaert dropped by this afternoon and left this fuller version of his
                        talk with <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2">On May 6, <persName corresp="#p_PR_2">Pipes</persName>
                            sent Leebaert’s <gloss target="#t_FBI_1">FBI</gloss> report (see <ref target="#d50fn1">footnote 1</ref>) to <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName> under cover of a memorandum in which he wrote:
                            “That <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> should have felt it
                            necessary to use as a conduit a young man without official connections
                            with the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration
                            suggests the degree of nervousness in Moscow over the refusal of this
                            Administration to negotiate for the sake of negotiating. <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>’s downgrading of <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s talks with <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> is indicative of his
                            long-standing dislike for the Soviet Ambassador in Washington and his
                            frustration at having been cut off from his usual channels of
                            communications in the United States to <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s advantage. Noteworthy too is <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>’s focusing on <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Meese</persName>. I believe he (and others in
                            Moscow) are desperately trying to arrange an end-run around you and the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Staff to get directly at the
                            President. This bears watching.” (Reagan Library, Executive Secretariat,

                        reinforces my feeling that <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> is
                        deeply frustrated by his inability to communicate with U.S. Government
                        officials, which is his stock in trade, while his arch-rival <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> has contacts. He pretends to speak
                        for the Soviet Government whereas he really speaks on his own behalf. His
                        advice to Leebaert to use <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> channels in
                        the Soviet Embassy rather than <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s is amusing. So is his uncertainty whether you are
                        quite as hard-line as I. (C)</p>

                    <p>This is a rough draft report of specific conversation in Moscow with
                            <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">G. Arbatov</persName>. A detailed essay that
                        covers the entire trip is now being prepared.</p>
                    <pb n="130" facs="0161" xml:id="pg_130"/>
                    <p>This is a report of a two hour talk with Georgy Arbatov on Friday 17 April.
                        12:00 through 2:00 had originally been set aside for a second one-on-one
                        conversation with <persName corresp="#p_BR_2">Bogdanov</persName>. We had
                        spent approximately four and half hours the preceeding Wednesday talking
                        together.</p>
                    <p>After delivering a morning lecture at the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> Institute on the 17th, I was told by <persName corresp="#p_BR_2">Bogdanov</persName> that something “extremely
                        important” would take place instead. He and I then went into <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>’s office. I had been told on my
                        arrival (Tuesday 14th April) that I “might” meet the Institute director
                        later in my eight day visit. By 17 April I was told that <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> had been back for 3 days.</p>
                    <p>The details of the conversation with <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> are related below. There were no more than six
                        one-sentence interjections by <persName corresp="#p_BR_2">Bogdanov</persName> during these two hours; he was nervous and fidgety
                        throughout. <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> stressed from the
                        beginning that I was the first visitor with Administration contacts and a
                        Republican identification to visit the Soviet Union since the inauguration.
                        He said that he knew that I was visiting the Institute in a private capacity
                        and that I was not a part of the Administration. Nevertheless, he emphasized
                        strongly this part of “being the first” and of being representative of both
                        a new sort of policy-maker in Washington and of a new foreign policy
                        perspective. He said that he understood that I knew his son from the United
                        States and that I would be seeing him in Moscow.</p>
                    <p>The discussion followed with only one interruption for tea to be delivered.
                        After <persName corresp="#p_BR_2">Bogdanov</persName> and I left the office
                        together, he took me aside in the hallway and again said how “extremely
                        important” the conversation with <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> had been. He said that he would explain why in his
                        office in an hour and forty-five minutes later when I returned from my lunch
                        with Sergey Plekhanov (head of general studies of U.S. domestic
                        politics).</p>
                    <p>
                     <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>’s themes concerned the
                        potential consequences of what the highest Soviet officials see as undiluted
                        personal insults, irresponsible new U.S. political actors, and the
                        termination of all channels of communication. The Soviet leadership, he
                        argued, cannot bear this indefinitely. What many of them perceive is
                        entirely new U.S. political/military direction of which intemperate
                        statements from Washington are only a small part. Major Soviet foreign
                        policy decisions have to be made, and their formulations cannot help but be
                        affected by this nearly unprecedented U.S.-Soviet environment.</p>
                    <p>He emphasized that this was not time to quarrel over the bureaucratic
                        politics of how influential his Institute may be or what personal policy
                        influence he has on the highest leadership. The problem is that the
                        leadership is under great pressure to reply forcefully. It is not simply
                        that the leadership is running out of patience (there are reserves left),
                        but rather that Moscow is far less unitary than Washington thinks <pb n="131" facs="0162" xml:id="pg_131"/>and that the pressures are
                        increasing. They need a signal—any at all—that there are possibilities of
                        working with the new Administration. They need some light.</p>
                    <p>A signal is needed because of those already conveyed by Moscow. Does
                        Washington not understand the <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName>
                        visit or the 26th Party Congress speech, he asked. It would have been far
                        easier for <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> to make a
                        strident “tighten the belt” speech in February. The Secretary could have
                        been more popular had he done this because such a speech would have both
                        addressed foreign policy and would have helped explain the domestic problems
                        that were acknowledged frankly. <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> apparently advised him not to reply in kind because
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> would be playing into
                        the hands of those people in Washington with whom the Soviet Union cannot do
                        business. There are some people who one cannot deal with and will stab you
                        in the back. <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PR_2">Pipes</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PR_1">Perle</persName>
                        (responsible for the worst of the <persName corresp="#p_JH_1">Jackson</persName> policies), and Lehman were cited as examples
                        although <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> acknowledged that he
                        was uncertain whether the first two were as close-minded as the others.</p>
                    <p>He said that the leadership obviously recognizes that there have been U.S.
                        officials with whom it could deal. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>
                        were mentioned and he asked about the influence of <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>. But the criticism of the new
                        U.S. security policy officials continued. He said that he told the
                        leadership that he had never seen such a low intellectual level in
                        Washington. There is an obvious understanding that U.S. leaders have to pay
                        off political debts by giving people positions but this was going too far
                        (although some extremists had admittedly been excluded). But how long can
                        the current situation continue, and what will be the results? What would
                        happen if the Yom Kippur War occurred today? He said that he had a real fear
                        of the consequences at this moment of any confrontation in the third
                        world.</p>
                    <p>The foreign policy of the Soviet Union like all states is made in day to day
                        decisions which this environment is affecting. Moreover, he repeated, there
                        are pressures for less restraint. (When asked to be specific he spoke of
                        replies in kind, that <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> could not just
                        lie, and that decisions would have to be made.) At what he called the most
                        basic level, <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> showed a file of
                        supposedly indignant letters he had received from readers because of his
                        moderate writings in <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>. He still says that he
                        believes that the Administration has not yet reached any policy, although
                        this is an optimistic view. But what will happen in the meantime? There are
                        people in the Soviet Union who are talking about fascist influences in
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>The lack of U.S.-Soviet communication resulting from the current climate
                        arose throughout. He spoke of an obvious recognition of new political actors
                        “such as you” as opposed to the others that the Soviet <pb n="132" facs="0163" xml:id="pg_132"/>Union had been dealing with. He had chosen
                        not to communicate with them until recently (the <persName corresp="#p_KG_2">Kintner</persName> discussion in December had some positive results)
                        and now there are no formal or informal contacts with the Administration.
                        They were surprised by comments from <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>, but hope that <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Meese</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName> who
                        do not yet seem to have such views will be influential. All channels have
                        been cut off, and this includes not even going to Geneva. The absence of a
                        U.S. Ambassador was noted and that, after all, it is the United States that
                        chooses to deal with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> because
                        he is so competent. With some few exceptions, the U.S. Ambassadors have not
                        been valuable or very bright. What is happening with <persName corresp="#p_SB_1">Scowcroft</persName>?</p>
                    <p>Random points were included in the conversation either as illustrations or as
                        asides. They included: The U.S. is going to lift the grain embargo anyway
                        (although <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> would tell the
                        leadership to make it clear that they could get along without it); the
                        Soviet Union got along well for sixteen years without U.S. diplomatic
                        relations and could do without them now; the stridency of Radio Free Europe
                        and Radio Liberty were noted, and he said that Voice of America is
                        important; <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> would like to
                        advise the Soviet leaders to let the U.S. proceed with <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> because it will tear the Alliance apart;
                        any recent stridency from Tass is blamed on inadequate night editing of the
                        wire reports; and the danger of combining U.S. weapon developments with the
                        existing rhetoric. And the cheap public diplomacy of the parking garage
                        space and of the visa extension are minor events that were seen as public
                        humiliations of the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>
                     <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> presented the common view of
                        an encircled Soviet Union facing not only the U.S. but two of its nuclear
                        allies as well as another ally with an army that is better than that of the
                        U.S. <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> was addressed briefly and
                        reference was made to the moratorium proposal. It was implied that once
                        talks started and Soviet deployments had halted, the U.S. could then begin
                        introducing some of its own weaponry without Soviet resumption. But it was
                        reemphasized that they could do more with defense, by pleas for national
                        sacrifice as they have done in the past.</p>
                    <p>There is considerable anxiety that Soviet signals and the difficulties of
                        restraint are not seen in Washington because people are preoccupied with
                        other concerns, are simply too inexperienced, or already have closed minds
                        on how to proceed.</p>
                    <p>
                     <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> asked that the contents of
                        this discussion be relayed to the highest U.S. officials (<persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Meese</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName> were implied) and not just turned over to <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PR_2">Pipes</persName>. (<persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> was not
                        stressed, and it seemed that <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>
                        was uncertain about his influence and tenure.) <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> said that “we do not want to use <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> for this” and that there are no
                        ways to communicate. I was asked to reply through Soviet diplo<pb n="133" facs="0164" xml:id="pg_133"/>matic pouch about the response to this
                        discussion. I was asked to do this as soon as possible and that no one would
                        need to know of such a communication.</p>
                    <p>Two hours later I met with <persName corresp="#p_BR_2">Bogdanov</persName> in
                        his office. He said that <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> had
                        met with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> that
                        morning and that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had been
                        personally reading <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>’s cables
                        from the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_BR_2">Bogdanov</persName> reemphasized
                        the “extreme importance of what just happened” (e.g. the talk with <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>), saying that it was by far the
                        most important point of the visit. He said that official channels with the
                        U.S. cannot be used for this.</p>
                    <p>
                     <persName corresp="#p_BR_2">Bogdanov</persName> said that after the lunch he
                        and I had two days previously, he had spoken with several important people
                        in the government. He said that it is the highest level of the Soviet
                        government that knows of this first quasi-official visit and of presumed
                        contacts with the Administration. He made it explicit that the highest level
                        wanted to establish a channel of communication, and that this is more
                        important than ever. He said that they cannot use the Soviet embassy for
                        this and that a reply is hoped for through pouch.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Charge <persName corresp="#p_MJF_1">Jack Matlock</persName> called today from
                        Moscow on the secure phone to report what appears to have been an official
                        approach to him in Moscow May 10 at a small Soviet dinner party on the
                        Soviet desire to establish an unofficial channel from us to them which would
                        bypass <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>. The approach was
                        made by a man named Sitnikov, ostensibly an official of a Soviet agency
                        which arranges foreign copyrights, <pb n="134" facs="0165" xml:id="pg_134"/>but whom we have identified in the past as a <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> agent. Sitnikov told <persName corresp="#p_MJF_1">Matlock</persName> that the Soviets now are very eager to start talking
                        to us about major issues and that everything is negotiable, including all of
                        the items which we have considered major sticking points in the past in
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> negotiations. Sitnikov said that
                        in order to make progress, however, it would be necessary to establish an
                        unofficial channel because <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        is so senior that everything he transmits goes straight to the Politburo
                        which then settles into inflexible positions and it takes months to budge
                        them.</p>
                    <p>The thrust of the approach was that this new channel would lead from us
                        directly to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> via <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>

                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_MJF_1">Matlock</persName> said that the dinner party

                        this and other reasons, he believes the approach is at least a legitimate
                        probe. He is writing up a complete report of his meeting which we will

                        d’Affaires in Moscow last week indicate that the Soviets are still
                        interested in a dialogue with us, but that they have little or nothing of
                        substance to say on the issues of primary concern to us. We <pb n="135" facs="0166" xml:id="pg_135"/>had instructed <persName corresp="#p_MJF_1">Matlock</persName> to see <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> to make certain that <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> is reporting our views accurately to Moscow, and
                        also to probe for any additional indications of Soviet thinking.</p>
                    <p>On the subject of the U.S.-Soviet dialogue itself, <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> acted as though our meeting with
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> in September should be considered firm
                        regardless of what might happen between now and then. <persName corresp="#p_MJF_1">Matlock</persName> disabused him of that notion. As
                        for a summit meeting, <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> said
                        only that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s response to your

                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> has been telling us that the
                        Soviets might be prepared to set a time-table for withdrawal from
                        Afghanistan, and we had instructed <persName corresp="#p_MJF_1">Matlock</persName> to probe for any elucidation of that point. What
                        came through from <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> was a
                        hard-line reiteration of the long-standing Soviet position, leaving no room
                        for us to expect any movement in the near future.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> made it clear that the
                        Soviets are still unwilling to discuss Poland with us. Despite what should
                        be an obvious Soviet interest in having the West continue its economic
                        assistance to Poland, <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>
                        refused to provide any information on what the Soviets are doing from their
                        side, claiming that it was a bilateral matter and that the Poles had in any
                        case fully informed us of the scope of Soviet assistance (which they have
                        not done).</p>
                    <p>Similarly, <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> continued the
                        Soviet stance of refusing to indicate what, if anything, they might be doing
                        to try to dampen the crisis in Lebanon. He admitted that the situation is
                        “dangerous and even explosive,” but he sought to exonerate the Syrians of
                        all blame. <persName corresp="#p_MJF_1">Matlock</persName>’s reiteration of
                        our strong views was nevertheless timely, as the meeting came on the eve of
                            <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>’s departure for
                        Damascus.</p>
                    <p>In the process of reiterating our position on Iran—something we had
                        instructed <persName corresp="#p_MJF_1">Matlock</persName> to do because
                        some Soviets have been questioning whether our recent silence on the point
                        indicated a change in U.S. policy—<persName corresp="#p_MJF_1">Matlock</persName> did elicit a reaffirmation that the Soviet Union is
                        “of course” against interference in the affairs of other countries,
                        including Iran. Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> acknowledged that the Soviets have not responded
                        to the unilateral Iranian abrogation of the articles of the 1921
                        Soviet-Iranian treaty which give the Soviet Union a right to intervene.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> expressed awareness of your
                        personal interest in resolving the problem of the Soviet Pentecostalists
                        residing in our Embassy in Moscow—the only bilateral issue on which this
                            Administra<pb n="136" facs="0167" xml:id="pg_136"/>tion at a high level
                        has sought Soviet cooperation. Nevertheless, he had absolutely nothing to
                        offer.</p>
                    <p>Our impression is that, while we have gotten the Soviets’ attention on a
                        range of troublesome issues, we have not yet persuaded them of the necessity
                        of movement toward a more conciliatory attitude.</p>

                    <p>The first page and a half is devoted to a rather restrained diatribe against
                        Israel and those who support her, and need not concern you. The final two
                        paragraphs, however, are of interest. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> says:</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>—The Soviets have taken note of our intention not to become involved
                            militarily in the event of an armed conflict, but believe the real task
                            is to <hi rend="italic">prevent</hi> a conflict.</p>
                        <p>—The Soviet Union is working to avoid a confrontation including during
                            “recent days.”</p>
                        <p>—The U.S. should restrain Israeli leaders.</p>
                        <p>—The United States and the Soviet Union should be able to reach “mutual
                            understanding” that would prevent the outbreak of war in the Middle
                            East.</p>
               </quote>
                    <p>During my talk with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> after I
                        had read the letter, the Soviet Ambassador described it as “constructive,”
                        meaning that Moscow is “restraining” Assad. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said, in a clear reference to his Friday night
                        remark about the possibility of a moratorium on Israeli reconnaissance
                        flights over the Bekaa Valley, that he had expected that we would already
                        have put forward such a compromise formula. He was, he said, surprised that
                        we had not yet done so. “After all, what would be in it for Assad?”, he
                        asked, pointing out that the Israelis would not be losing much by detouring
                        their reconnaissance flights some 20 or 30 kilometers off their normal
                        route.</p>
                    <p>Thus, despite the polemics in the letter, the last two paragraphs of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> letter, plus <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s comments, seem to indicate that
                        the Soviets remain in contact with Assad, and that hope remains that a
                        compromise formula acceptable to Syria and Israel can yet be found. We can
                        anticipate that the proposal that the Israelis forego <pb n="138" facs="0169" xml:id="pg_138"/>reconnaissance flights over the Bekaa
                        Valley in return for Syrian withdrawal will surface at some point in the not
                        too distant future.</p>

                  </dateline>
                    <p>Dear Mr. Secretary,</p>
                    <p>I have carefully studied your letter of May 15, 1981 and must regretfully
                        state that the interpretation given there to what is going in and around
                        Lebanon is one-sided and non-reflective of the real state of affairs. As a
                        result Israel—the true source of the dangerous exacerbation of the
                        situation—is being whitewashed whereas totally unsubstantiated charges and
                        demands are being addressed to Syria.</p>
                    <p>However, you have no smaller knowledge than ourselves of the actual sequence
                        of the events. You, of course, know, for instance, that the Syrian
                        anti-aircraft missile weapons did not emerge in Lebanon until Israeli
                        fighters had shot down two unarmed Syrian transport helicopters used to
                        carry supplies to the Syrian contingent lawfully deployed in Lebanon as part
                        of the Arab peace keeping force in that country. On the part of Israel this
                        was an act of aggression.</p>
                    <p>So, why is the question raised of having Syria withdraw from Lebanon those
                        weapons as a “sine qua non for any settlement” when, at the same time, there
                        is complete silence on the question of having Israel cease the aggressive
                        actions which made it necessary for Syria to take counter-measures in
                        self-defence?</p>
                    <p>If not for elementary fairness, is this a realistic way to pose the question
                        and how, then, can one be surprised at Syria rejecting such an approach?
                        After all, what right has Israel to carry out air strikes or other military
                        actions in Lebanon? To follow this kind of logic, it turns out that Israel
                        may continue its brigandage in Lebanon and interfere in the internal affairs
                        of that country while defensive steps against those Israeli actions are
                        barred.</p>
                    <p>If what you call the US efforts to “restrain” Israel in fact amounts to such
                        an approach to this matter, then there is no wonder that Israel goes on with
                        putting forward its demands.</p>
                    <pb n="139" facs="0170" xml:id="pg_139"/>
                    <p>This is the reason why the responsibility for further serious exacerbation of
                        the situation around Lebanon and in the entire Middle East as well as,
                        possibly, beyond that area, and the danger thereof is mentioned in your
                        letter, will rest not only on Israel but also on those who could exert
                        influence on Israel and do not wish to do so.</p>
                    <p>We, of course, take note of the fact that in case of an armed conflict the
                            <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> does not intend to be involved in
                        it militarily. We are deeply convinced, however, that the task is to
                        actually prevent the current situation from growing into an armed
                        conflict.</p>
                    <p>A new military confrontation in that area would serve nobody’s interests and
                        it can and must be prevented. It is in this direction that the Soviet Union
                        is applying its efforts, including in the most recent days. We would like to
                        count on the US side also acting with broader interests of peace in mind and
                        on its exerting really restraining influence on the Israeli leaders. No
                        reasonable man will believe that the United States of America and the Soviet
                        Union, being the kind of powers they are, cannot reach an elementary mutual
                        understanding in order to prevent the outbreak of military conflict in the
                        Middle East.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Minister:</p>
                    <p>As you know, for the past week Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Philip
                            Habib</persName> has at the request of President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>, been conducting urgent
                        consultations in Lebanon, Syria, and Israel with the aim of promoting a
                        peaceful solution to the current dangerous situation in Lebanon. We have
                        recently received a report from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> concerning his latest conversation with President
                        Assad. That report indicates that the Syrians are not prepared to accept any
                        compromise on removal of Syrian Surface to Air Missiles in the Bikka Valley,
                        a <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> for any settlement. They were also
                        less than forthcoming with respect to reasonable proposals approved by the
                        Government of Lebanon to replace the Syrian forces on the Sannine <pb n="140" facs="0171" xml:id="pg_140"/>Ridge and in Zahle. In sum, the
                        Syrians are unwilling to return to the status quo ante in Lebanon. These
                        developments, in the view of the United States Government, indicate that
                        events in and around Lebanon have reached an extremely dangerous
                        impasse.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> was instructed to inform
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BM_2">Begin</persName> of the outcome
                        of his latest discussion with President Assad. We have also told him to
                        proceed from Jerusalem to Saudi Arabia for further consultations, and to go,
                        thereafter, to Damascus for a further conversation with President Assad. If
                        the Syrian President indicates at that time that there has been no change in
                        his position, it will be difficult for us to avoid concluding that we have
                        done all we can to assist the parties to find a compromise solution.</p>
                    <p>It should be clear to all that the United States has effectively restrained
                        Israel from a resort to military action throughout the past difficult weeks.
                        Further, the Israelis have shown considerable flexibility in the search for
                        an acceptable compromise. Unfortunately, Syria has demonstrated neither
                        restraint nor flexibility. Thus, should Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName>’s mission end without positive results, despite our
                        best efforts, our ability effectively to influence the Israelis further will
                        be greatly diminished.</p>
                    <p>As we have for some weeks been indicating to your government, we consider the
                        situation in and around Lebanon extremely dangerous—one which certainly
                        contains the seeds of war in the Middle East, and possibly beyond. It is to
                        avert that danger that we have taken every possible step to urge restraint
                        on Israel, while seeking to assist the other parties to the dispute toward a
                        mutually acceptable solution. Unfortunately, we have seen no evidence that
                        others who might be in a position to influence events have worked with equal
                        diligence to do so.</p>
                    <p>The situation is now at a critical stage. Should the current crisis escalate
                        into armed conflict, it will be our intention to remain militarily
                        uninvolved; we will insist upon the same restraint from others.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Foreign Minister, it now remains for those nations which have influence
                        in Damascus, such as the Soviet Union, to make one last effort to avert what
                        could become a human tragedy for Lebanese, Syrians, and Israelis alike.</p>

                    <p>Here are our thoughts on Soviet motivation for the “Special Channel” proposal

                    <p>1. The major operational Soviet motivation is probably to <hi rend="italic">get <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> talks going</hi>

                        for broad political and security reasons—not out of love for arms control.
                        They may still hope to bring back one-sided detente and to derail our
                        defense programs.<note n="4" xml:id="d55fn4">

                    <p>2. Thus they may be using this <hi rend="italic">tactical device</hi> to

                        1977, that they don’t want <hi rend="italic">

                        to the Defense Minister and Ministry. An American interlocutor in Moscow

                        of US-Soviet relations through this back door or otherwise. In any case, we

                        We could use it to reinforce what is said in official channels and to make

                        crises—if one is in place we can avoid initial uncertainties. Therefore we
                        may not want to foreclose it. And we don’t want to pass the wrong signal

                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi> The discussion paper reflects sound interagency
                        consensus. Let us review its basic points. The <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> is essentially a technical body reviewing <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> compliance issues. At this forum, we
                        will express some general concerns about non-<gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> arms control compliance issues, but we see more detailed
                        expressions of such non-<gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> concerns as
                        one to be delivered through our Embassy in Moscow by our Chargé, <persName corresp="#p_MJF_1">Jack Matlock</persName>. On the <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> Treaty, we will provide the routine
                        notifications, state our adherence, and raise compliance concerns involving
                        concurrent Soviet testing of SAMs and radars. On the Interim Agreement
                            (<gloss target="#t_IA_1">IA</gloss>) and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, we will be noncommittal about our observance, using
                        only the general formula that while our policy review is underway, we will
                        take no actions to undercut existing agreements as long as the Soviet Union
                        exercises the same restraints. At the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>,
                        we will not raise compliance issues in terms of specific provisions of the
                        Interim and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreements but, in the
                        general context of compliance concerns, would raise the three issues of: (1)
                        telemetry encryption; (2) reconstitution/reload capability; and (3) <gloss target="#t_ICBM_1">ICBM</gloss> launcher dismantling. Internally, we
                        would agree not to seek ratification of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, and would agree that we are prepared to take actions
                        inconsistent with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II and the Interim
                        Agreement, if required by national security considerations.</p>
                    <p>Our next steps in developing our <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        policy should be to ask the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_IG_1">IG</gloss>, which has done an outstanding job so
                        far, to undertake three further analyses. First, the <gloss target="#t_IG_1">IG</gloss> should consider steps by which we would implement our
                        internal policy concerning <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II and the
                        Interim Agreement, including the modalities of withdrawing the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty from the Senate, how we should
                        officially inform the Soviets, what to say to our Congress and public, and
                        what, if any, planned or proposed US defense programs might be inconsistent
                        with the Interim Agreement or <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II.
                        Second, the <gloss target="#t_IG_1">IG</gloss> should undertake a formal
                        interagency review of the <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> Treaty and of
                        US <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> options in the arms control context.
                        Third, the <gloss target="#t_IG_1">IG</gloss> should initiate a study of
                        long-term US <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> approaches designed to
                        support our strategic force modernization programs and including our policy
                        towards the Soviets and towards our Allies.</p>

                        see this <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> as a technical-level
                        discussion, but the Soviets will surely want to use it for much wider
                        purposes, including probes of our positions on the Interim Agreement and
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. We should emphasize that this
                        is a lower-level technical forum, and we should stay away from larger arms
                        control issues. On the internal policy review issue, I do not think we
                        should say that we will take actions inconsistent with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. After all, <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II is not in effect. President <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> urged that the Senate not vote on it, and it is in no
                        sense pending. Earlier, the Armed Services Committee rejected it by vote of
                        10–0, and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee favored it by only one
                        vote. <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II is not alive. Our defense
                        budget does not involve any violation of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreement, but that was by chance, and we should retain
                        flexibility.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REV_1">Rostow</persName>:</hi> In
                        preparing the back-up policy papers for today, over 30 suspected Soviet arms
                        control violations were carefully examined. The proposed instructions to our
                            <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> Commissioner would raise five
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> compliance issues as follows: (1)
                        SAM and <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> concurrent testing; (2) large
                        phased-array radars; (3) telemetry encryption; (4) reconstitution/reload
                        capability; and (5) <gloss target="#t_ICBM_1">ICBM</gloss> launcher
                        dismantling. In instructions to our Embassy in Moscow, we would have them
                        raise four non-<gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> compliance issues as
                        matters of US concern, to include: (1) chemical warfare in Afghanistan and
                        elsewhere; (2) biological incidents at Sverdlovsk; (3) the floating of
                        radioactive materials; and (4) nuclear testing.</p>
                    <p>Looking ahead, I would like our arms control policy to accentuate the
                        positive. We should not be talking just about withdrawal but what to do
                        next. In my calls on Senator <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName>
                        and other Senators, we agreed that the best way to handle the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty issue would be via a Senate
                        resolution, unanimous if possible, sending it back to the White House, while
                        at about the same time, the Administration would announce its policy of
                        where we want to go in arms control and what we wish to achieve.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">General <persName corresp="#p_JDC_1">Jones</persName>:</hi>
                        We have found past <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> meetings with the
                        Soviets very useful. It is a rare forum for military-to-military contact. On
                        the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> approach proposed before us today,
                        we have no fundamental differences. However, we see a problem in the
                        proposed distinction between our internal and external policy on our
                        observance of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II and the Interim
                        Agreement. Publicly, it is proposed that we would <pb n="147" facs="0178" xml:id="pg_147"/>say we will take no actions inconsistent with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, while internally we would agree to
                        take actions inconsistent with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II and
                        the Interim Agreement, if required by national security considerations. We
                        should recognize that the Soviets can do many things in the near term if
                        they cease to observe current <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        restrictions, such as increasing their SS–18 Reentry Vehicles (RVs) from 10
                        to 20 or 30. In the short run, we cannot match them. We would, therefore,
                        prefer to see us stay with the language that we will not take actions that
                        would undercut existing agreements as long as the Soviet Union exercises the
                        same restraints. A further consideration is that we probably cannot keep the
                        knowledge of any sensitive internal US Government decision within the
                        confines of this room.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Meese</persName>:</hi> We
                        can keep it in this room. Our internal decision would not be communicated to
                        the Commissioner.</p>

                        I am quite comfortable with the language here in our discussion paper, but I
                        would like to have the old language in any public areas.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>:</hi> Several practical issues are involved
                        here. For example, if our 4,600 M–X holes have to be opened up under <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II verification, this adds three to four
                        billion dollars in cost. As for jeopardizing current <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II restrictions on the Soviets, there
                        are things the Soviets could choose to do, of course, but I suspect they are
                        doing these things anyway, and I am against restraining our own programs.
                        That’s why I opposed <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. Also, our
                        Trident program is affected, and a whole host of other programs.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Meese</persName>:</hi> Our
                        public posture should be that of taking no actions that would undercut
                        existing agreements as long as the Soviets exercise the same restraints. On
                        the other hand, none of our programs should be inhibited by <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi> That’s right. And we should be saying that we are

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> What can the Soviets really do that
                        prevents us from telling them now that we cannot go along with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II?</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName>:</hi> It
                        would indicate to the rest of the world that we are against the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> process. We’ve all been imprisoned by
                        the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> language. We need some new
                        categories, e.g., Strategic Arms Reductions Talks. They would be known as
                            <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>:</hi> We should also be looking at <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> defense as arms control. Let’s keep our

                        between real arms reductions, as distinguished from arms limitations, the
                        public does not realize the important differences. For example, in <pb n="148" facs="0179" xml:id="pg_148"/>
                  <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, the Soviets could deploy an unlimited number of missiles
                        and their intercontinental Backfire bombers.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> Why should we preserve the illusion of

                        and do what we accuse the Soviets of doing, i.e., violating it?</p>

                        With <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> restrictions lifted, the Soviets
                        could rapidly deploy more missiles, warheads, and Backfire bombers, and
                        there is little, if anything, we can do to prevent or to match it. There is
                        no <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> impact on our M–X now because we
                        will not begin deployment until 1986. You can forget about the M–X
                        verification port holes until 1984. On Trident, we can make a decision a
                        year from now. Let’s stick with the public statement.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi> We have to avoid creating a negative stalemate in

                        So far, they have taken no actions inconsistent with the provisions of the

                        agenda will be US policy toward the Caribbean Basin. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> will outline the policy guidelines
                        that have been developed in the interagency paper on this area.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi> Before reviewing the major conclusions of the
                        Caribbean study, it should first be noted that one of the most critical
                        questions in the Caribbean area has to do with Cuban troublemaking, and that
                        we need to develop a strategy to deal with Cuba. This will be done
                        separately and will be presented to the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                        at a later date. However, we need to come up with a broader strategy to work
                        on some of the underlying causes that have permitted Cuba to undermine US
                        interests in the Caribbean Basin. The proposed Caribbean Basin plan will be
                        very popular within the region and the country. It would certainly set the
                        stamp for the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                        Administration’s policy in the Caribbean, and would help to offset some of
                        the criticisms that have been leveled against us over the El Salvador
                        problem. It would also help us get away from the idea that we are solely
                        interested in military options.</p>
                    <p>The State-drafted paper addresses the problem of preventing future Cuban
                        successes in the region by dealing with the underlying conditions that make
                        Cuban-style subversion possible. The paper outlines a Caribbean Basin
                        proposal that focuses on improving economic conditions in the region. It
                        also indicates further measures to improve internal security by providing
                        effective security assistance to friendly governments. It addresses the
                        question of how best to keep Nicaragua from becoming entirely a creature of
                        the Soviet Union and Cuba. In addition, these steps will be implemented by
                        measures to alter Cuban and Soviet policy in the area. Finally, the proposal
                        includes initiatives to generate support for our policies in the US, our
                        Allies, and world opinion generally.</p>

                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> called to fill me in on
                        his luncheon at the Soviet Embassy with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> May 23. I had previously given
                            <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> some suggested themes and
                        questions for the occasion, which he said he had used, adding a few points
                        of his own. <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> were accompanied by their
                        wives.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> said he had begun the
                        substantive conversation by expressing concern about Soviet rhetoric,
                        particularly the personal charges made by the Soviets against the President
                        and the Secretary. <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> expressed
                        his hope that these Soviet charges could be stopped, adding that they could
                        lead to no good. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> became
                        emotional on this issue, remarking that the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration itself had taken the initiative in
                        launching personal attacks against the Soviet leaders; he particularly
                        objected to charges that the Soviets supported international terrorism. Both
                            <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> agreed that it would be better to
                        tone down the rhetoric on both sides, and both would do all they could to
                        reduce verbal attacks.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> remarked that most press
                        accounts of the <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> speech were
                            inaccurate.<note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2">On May 22, <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> delivered a speech in Tbilisi,
                            Georgia, which the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> reported as
                            calling for an international conference on the Middle East. See Serge
                            Schmemann, “<persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> Warns of
                            Mideast Dangers,” <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, May 23, 1981,
                            p. 4.</note> No conference specifically about Lebanon was mentioned by
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>. The Soviets would like
                        to participate in a conference on a number of issues, including the Middle
                        East. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> added that U.S. policy
                        towards the present Middle East situation is too heavily influenced by
                        Israel, which makes things extraordinarily difficult. He said <persName corresp="#p_BM_2">Begin</persName>’s bid for re-election has caused him
                        to take rash actions.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> complained about Soviet media
                        criticism of the <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> mission and
                        asked why the Soviets had not been more helpful. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        <pb n="151" facs="0182" xml:id="pg_151"/>seemed unsure of himself on this
                        and had no good answer to this question. <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> felt that in reality <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> understood the importance of <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName>’s mission and wished him well.</p>
                    <p>With regard to an international conference, <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> asked why the Soviets did not concentrate more on
                        Afghanistan. Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName>
                        said, had so poisoned the atmosphere and harmed Moscow. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> answered by saying that the huge
                        military build-up in the Persian Gulf area has hindered concentration on
                        Afghanistan. He then said that after all, the Soviets had not yet built a
                        long reaching airbase in Afghanistan that could reach throughout the Middle
                        East. (<persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> commented to me that he
                        had seen the airbase built in Afghanistan at Kandahar with AID money years
                        ago. There is no question, he said, but that it is susceptible to
                        expansion.) <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said any
                        international conference could begin with Afghanistan and the Gulf area. He
                        repeated standard Soviet references to the need for stopping interference
                        against Afghanistan from Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said the West’s advantage
                        over the Soviets in <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> was already 1½ to
                        1. <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> responded by saying that
                        the proximity of the Soviet Union to Europe must be taken into account when
                        speaking of any numbers. The U.S. and its allies must have a deterrent force
                        in being, since reinforcements would be slow in coming compared with what
                        the Soviets could bring in. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        remarked that <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> talks were desirable. He
                        only wished more could be done between now and September and couldn’t see
                        why we had to wait so long. The U.S., <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said, constantly hides behind the excuse that its
                        position is still under review, but the problem has been there for years and
                        the U.S. should be prepared to move now.</p>
                    <p>When <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> brought up the subject of
                        a <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> succession, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> became very guarded. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> did say that a successor might
                        well not be as interested in arms limitation talks as <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>. This is why <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> constantly alludes to resumption
                        of talks. He is personally devoted to and dedicated to arms limitation.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> added that part of the
                        problem of resumption of talks is that every time a problem comes up—like
                        the Middle East situation—it is converted by the U.S. into a Soviet problem.
                        This has hindered our sitting down to discuss matters seriously.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> displayed uncertainty and
                        frustration about the direction of the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration. He was quite skeptical, adding that
                        things will get worse before they get any better.</p>
                    <p>When asked by <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> whether the
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> speech in Tbilisi
                        included any new positions, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        said it was a further development of the 26th Party Congress. The most
                        important point to remember is that it is crucial to take up matters
                        relating to arms control now—time is of the essence.</p>
                    <pb n="152" facs="0183" xml:id="pg_152"/>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> inquired about the proposal for
                        a step-by-step withdrawal in Afghanistan, but <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> had no specifics to add.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> stated that our desire for
                        build-up in the Persian Gulf area would not be as great if there had been no
                        Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and stepped-up Soviet loans and military
                        aid to India. This has frightened the Pakistanis. We are doing all we can to
                        restrain the Pakistanis from going ahead with their plans for nuclear
                        development, but the Soviet presence in Afghanistan and the refugee problem
                        makes Pakistan nervous about its own security. <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> urged that the Soviets try to restrain the Indians
                        from further nuclear testing. Another Indian nuclear explosion would be
                        disastrous, leading the Pakistanis to take matters into their own hands.
                        This problem between India and Pakistan is one of the things we should be
                        talking about, he said.</p>
                    <p>While discussing the reciprocal extension of <gloss target="#t_CBMs_1">CBMs</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said the
                        Soviets made the proposal and are now waiting for the U.S. to come back with
                        counter proposals. <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> got the
                        impression that the Soviets are waiting for the actual <gloss target="#t_CDE_1">CDE</gloss> conference and don’t expect the U.S. to
                        say much until then.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> was very interested in the
                        U.S. Ambassador to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. When
                            <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> asked what names <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> had heard, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> mentioned <persName corresp="#p_SB_1">Scowcroft</persName>, Kendall and <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> added that if the U.S. were looking for a
                        professional, <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> would be an
                        “extremely good man.”</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> questioned <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> about General <persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowny</persName>’s role in <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>. Will he be part of <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>
                        or act independently? <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> said his
                        own feeling was that <persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowny</persName> would be
                        part of a team and that this seemed to be working out. <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> further added that during the course
                        of the confirmation hearings he would urge that the U.S. move soon to
                        serious arms limitation discussions.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> doubted the commitment of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration to arms
                        control agreements, noting in particular the failure to push for
                        ratification of the threshold treaties and the <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss> treaty.</p>
                    <p>Reverting to U.S. plans for <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>
                        modernization, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> reminded
                            <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> that Europe was only four
                        minutes from the Soviet Union. If the Soviets see a missile coming,
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> remarked, they have only
                        four minutes to decide what to do. He could not emphasize more strongly how
                        the Soviet people felt about this. Irina Dobrynin joined in at this point,
                        asking <persName corresp="#p_PCH_1">Percy</persName> whether he had any idea
                        of the average Soviet perception of the American role. The Soviet people
                        feel that the U.S. is bearing in on them and feel encircled by enemies. They
                        also are concerned by the level of criticism of the Soviet Union in the
                        U.S.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> was vague about his
                        long-range plans but said he planned to spend the summer in Moscow. His wife

                    </list>
                    <p>This afternoon Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        gave me the attached <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> reply
                        to your April 24 handwritten letter.<note n="2" xml:id="d58fn2">See <ref target="#d46">Document 46</ref>.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> tries—and to some degree
                        succeeds—to match the constructive tone of your own letter. The first three
                        pages are devoted to a review of history from 1945 to the advent of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> Administration. It is not
                        a history that any of us would recognize, but it attempts to show that in
                        fact the deterioration of relations between the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the U.S. was a consequence of American actions ranging
                        from the imposition of a pax Americana, through the creation of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> (“a closed military bloc”), to granting
                        of economic assistance only to those who would knuckle under to our
                        diktat.</p>
                    <p>Nor does President <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> escape,
                        since he is blamed for the “lion’s share” of the responsibility for the
                        deterioration in U.S.-Soviet relations after the era of detente. You, too,
                        are held responsible for the poor state of relations, since you have decided
                        to continue the <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> path.</p>
                    <p>Despite the above, however, the major impression I get from the letter is a
                        sense of substantial Soviet nervousness and concern. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> asks almost plaintively why we
                        continue to supply arms to Afghanistan insurgents and then reassures you
                        that the Soviets do not seek confrontation and do not wish to “infringe on
                        American legitimate interests.” The Soviet concern is for “honest and
                        constructive negotiations” with <pb n="154" facs="0185" xml:id="pg_154"/>the
                        West that will remove outstanding issues. He ends with an almost open appeal
                        for a face-to-face meeting with you.</p>
                    <p>In sum, while the letter offers nothing new or startling, it is markedly
                        different in tone from earlier <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> communications and, to me at least, demonstrates a
                        substantial lack of Soviet confidence.</p>
                    <p>In my conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        following his delivery of the letter, I was again struck by the evident
                        nervousness, confusion, and lack of confidence <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> himself displayed. He began by emphasizing that the
                        Soviets have deliberately not responded to serious U.S. “provocations.”
                        Specifically, despite attacks by the President, the Secretary of State, and
                        the Secretary of Defense, Moscow has refrained from replying in kind and has
                        acted with “restraint.” <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        showed particular sensitivity with regard to our charges that the Soviets
                        are aiding and abetting terrorism, and added that the Soviet Union has done
                        “nothing since January 20” to aggravate our bilateral relationship or
                        threaten U.S. interests.</p>
                    <p>Returning to an old theme, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        asked plaintively why we cannot talk about the Middle East; we might even be
                        happy to learn about Soviet views on issues such as the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>. He said that our talks could be bilateral
                        if we wish, rather than multilateral, but that it was important that the two
                        countries get into discussions on the whole range of Middle East issues. He
                        added that he is “sure” the Syrians would do nothing in Lebanon and hoped
                        that the Israelis would act with equal restraint. “No one,” he said, “wants
                        a conflict there.”</p>
                    <p>I replied that it was important to understand that there are limits to
                        Israeli patience, particularly when they watch the build-up of Syrian forces
                        in Syria itself.</p>
                    <p>On <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked why we were waiting so long to begin
                        discussions with the Soviets, and suggested that we ought to begin soon
                        (“Why not next week?”).</p>
                    <p>Moving on to the more general question of negotiations between the U.S. and
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that Moscow was prepared to negotiate on
                        specific issues such as Cuba, Africa, Afghanistan, arms control, and trade
                        whenever the U.S. wishes, but that Moscow could not accept the concept of
                        linkage. It is unacceptable to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to
                        be told that the U.S. is unwilling to begin discussions with the Soviets in
                        one area until they correct their conduct in some other, unrelated, area. I
                        replied that linkage was a fact of life, and that we could not sit by while
                        the Soviets and Cubans continued to pump arms into Nicaragua as if these
                        Russian activities were of no importance to us. The Soviets must expect that
                        such activities would inevitably affect our attitude toward
                        negotiations.</p>

                            1981</date>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
                    <p>I gave a careful thought to your personal letter to me and want to respond to
                        it in the same personal and frank manner.</p>
                    <p>Just as you do, I recall our brief conversation at the reception given by
                        President R. Nixon at “Casa Pacifica” in June 1973. Today, as we did at that
                        time, all Soviet leadership and I commit our hearts and minds to realization
                        of hopes and aspirations of all the peoples of the world for peace, quiet
                        life and confidence in their future.</p>
                    <p>At the recent congress of our Party it was with all due emphasis stressed
                        once again that not war preparations that doom the peoples to a senseless
                        squandering of their material and spiritual wealth, but preservation and
                        consolidation of peace, and, thereby, implementation of the foremost right
                        of every man—a right to live that is the clue to the future.</p>
                    <p>I noted that, recalling the year of 1973 you indicated that peace and good
                        will among men never had seemed closer at hand.</p>
                    <p>And, indeed, precisely in those years our two countries took the path of
                        reaching agreements which marked a radical turn for the better not only in
                        Soviet-American relations but in the international situation as a whole.
                        Those were the years when the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the
                            <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> actively and not without success
                        set about to solve the task of limiting arms, first of all strategic arms,
                        when they started seeking in common solutions to acute international
                        problems, when mutually beneficial bilateral ties and cooperation between
                        our countries in a variety of fields were developing fruitfully.</p>
                    <p>Why then did hitches begin to appear in that process, why did it pause and
                        even find itself set back? To answer this question correctly one thing is
                        necessary—to take an objective, non-biased look at the course of events.</p>
                    <p>And then, Mr. President, we shall recall, that even at that time when
                        Soviet-American relations were developing upward voices resounded in the
                        United States of those who did not like such a development and who
                        stubbornly tried to slow down and disrupt this process. And further on,
                        their efforts became ever more active. Those were the <pb n="156" facs="0187" xml:id="pg_156"/>efforts that were pulling back to
                        confrontation, efforts embodied in quite a number of concrete steps directly
                        aimed against the improvement of relations between the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>, against the relaxation of international tension. On the
                        contrary, nothing of the sort was taking place in the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>We have differencies of opinion between us of philosophical and ideological
                        nature, and it could not be otherwise. But when it comes to the events of
                        international life—whether pertaining to the present day, to the recent or
                        more distant past—then an objective approach is not only possible, but
                        necessary. Otherwise it is easy to misstep and to plunge into serious
                        errors.</p>
                    <p>Here, for example, it is said in your letter that after the Second World War
                        the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> had a capability to dominate the
                        world, but, deliberately, as it were, made no use of that capability. Let me
                        say it straight away, it is hard to find many people among those who are
                        familiar with that time through their own experience or who have seriously
                        studied it, that would share such an affirmation.</p>
                    <p>Actually, the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> did the maximum it could
                        using a wide array of military, political, and economic means to achieve
                        what American leaders themselves called “Pax Americana”, in other words, to
                        restructure the world the way the United States wanted it to be. But this
                        proved to be beyond its possibilities—and this is the way it was. Even the
                        posession during a certain period of time of what you call “the ultimate
                        weapon” didn’t make the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> omnipotent.</p>
                    <p>To follow your logic, we, in our turn, could have said that after the defeat
                        of the Hitler Germany and, incidentally, even before the American atomic
                        bomb emerged, the Soviet Union was in a position to do much of what it
                        didn’t do being guided by its principled convictions, true to its word and
                        respecting its allied commitments. However I wouldn’t like to go deeper into
                        this subject now and to discuss events that didn’t take place.</p>
                    <p>You are saying that the policy of the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>
                        has never constituted a threat to anyone else’s security. Let us go back to
                        the facts again. Hardly three years passed after the end of the war when the
                            <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> set about to create the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>—a closed military block. One would
                        wonder what the need for it was. After all, facist Germany had been routed
                        and militarist Japan—destroyed. The keys to peace were in the hands of the
                        allied powers of the Anti-Hitler coalition. Who was the target of the
                        military block of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and the numerous
                        overseas American bases? No secret was ever made in the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> who all that was directed against.</p>
                    <p>You made mention of the post-war American economic assistance programs. The
                            <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> did really give assistance. But who
                        was the recipient? It was only those countries which chose to submit their
                        policy to <pb n="157" facs="0188" xml:id="pg_157"/>foreign interests. On the
                        contrary, the states belonging to a different social system, and, indeed,
                        generally the peoples which did not agree to submit their policy to outside
                        diktat did not receive the American assistance. That is how the matters
                        stood. In essence that is precisely how they stand at the present time.</p>
                    <p>If we are to take the most recent years, when after a period of ascent the
                        relations between our countries began to deteriorate and deteriorate
                        sharply, it is known that the lion’s share was contributed to that by the
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> administration. That was
                        done consciously and purposefully, but in the final analysis, let us be
                        frank, it brought no laurels to <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>. Isn’t it so, Mr. President?</p>
                    <p>However, for some reason or other, the new US administration too has decided
                        to continue on the same path. Try, Mr. President, to see what is going on
                        through our eyes. Attempts are being made to revitalize the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>-made military and political alliances, new
                        bases are being added to those which already exist thousands of kilometers
                        away from the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> and aimed against our
                        country, the American military presence abroad in general is being increased
                        and expanded, large areas of the world are being declared spheres of “vital
                        interests” of the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>. Nobody even asks if
                        the peoples inhabiting those areas wish to be under the patronage of other
                        countries. Attempts are made to tell some other peoples what to do with
                        their natural resources, threatening them otherwise with all kinds of
                        punitive actions.</p>
                    <p>For all their differences, however, the peoples have the same right to be
                        masters of their own destiny. There should be no double standards in this
                        respect. One must not believe that if something is good for the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> then it has also to be good for others.
                        After all, is it good, for instance, for the average American family, not to
                        mention the family of a peaceful Afghan peasant, when the intention is
                        openly announced in Washington to go on with supplying arms to the bands
                        carrying out incursions into the Afghanistan territory from the outside?</p>
                    <p>It is not for the sake of polemics that I am sharing my thoughts with you,
                        Mr. President. I would like them, on the one hand, to give you a better
                        understanding of what actually constitutes the policy of the Soviet Union,
                        and, on the other hand, to help clarify how we and indeed, others as well,
                        perceive certain actions of the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>,
                        especially those of recent time.</p>
                    <p>The main idea, though, that I would like to convey through my letter is that
                        we do not seek confrontation with the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>
                        or infringe upon American legitimate interests. What we seek is different—we
                        wish peace, cooperation, a sense of mutual trust, and benevolence between
                        the Soviet Union and the United States of America. Guided by this sincere
                        desire we propose now to the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> and other
                        Western countries honest and constructive negotiations, as well as a search
                        for <pb n="158" facs="0189" xml:id="pg_158"/>mutually acceptable solutions
                        of practically all major questions existing between us—be it restraining of
                        the arms race, elimination of most dangerous sources of tension in various
                        areas of the world, or measures for confidence building and developing a
                        mutually beneficial cooperation. These proposals of ours contain no ruse or
                        any ulterior motives. And I would like you to accept them precisely in this
                        way and with no bias.</p>
                    <p>Thus our policy is a policy of peace. We will never set up the fire of war.
                        You know very well, as we do, what such a fire would lead to. I would want
                        to believe in the wisdom of your people, in your personal wisdom also not to
                        allow anything that would push the world towards a catastrophe.</p>
                    <p>These are some of the general considerations which I wanted to convey to you,
                        Mr. President, in connection with your letter. Maybe it was not possible to
                        express everything in sufficient detail. An exchange of correspondence has
                        its limitations, and in this sense a private conversation is better. In this
                        regard, concerning the possible meeting between us, I would like to say that
                        it is also my view that such a meeting should be well prepared. We could yet
                        return to the question of its timing, I believe, at a moment acceptable to
                        both of us.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> came back to see
                        me this afternoon to give me the attached reply from <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> to your formal letter of April
                            24.<note n="2" xml:id="d59fn2">See <ref target="#d47">Document
                            47</ref>.</note>

                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> makes the following
                        points:</p>
                    <p>—There is <hi rend="italic">no Soviet military threat</hi>, nor does the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> seek military superiority or
                        unilateral advantage; impetus for the arms race comes from the US side;</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">
                     <gloss target="#t_CDE_1">CDE</gloss> is treated in
                            standard form</hi>, although the compromise <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> suggested in his Tbilisi speech (that the West can
                        defer its response on the Soviet “to the Urals” concession until the <gloss target="#t_CDE_1">CDE</gloss> itself) curiously is not mentioned;</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">
                     <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> is also treated in
                            predictable terms</hi>, and the <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> moratorium proposal is again plugged;</p>
                    <p>—Poland and Afghanistan are briefly mentioned but nothing significant is said
                        about either situation.</p>
                    <p>On balance there is nothing new in the substance of the letter, which is
                        noteworthy only for its relatively non-polemical tone. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> could have opted to come back
                        hard. He clearly chose not to.</p>
                    <p>While <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s letter essentially
                        repeats standard positions, <hi rend="italic">I see merit in an eventual
                            reply</hi> which maintains the constructive tone of the exchange but
                        firmly rebuts the major distortions in <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s letter and reasserts our substantive concerns.
                        If, as seems likely, we get back more standard language we will have good
                        ammunition to shoot at the Soviet charge about our alledged unwillingness to
                        engage in meaningful dialogue. And, in the meantime, we can of course tell
                        our allies that we are doing our best to continue the dialogue.</p>
                    <p>After receiving <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s letter from
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>, I introduced the <hi rend="italic">subject of the Middle East</hi> and told him that
                            <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> is back in town to consult
                        with you. I noted that the Arab Group will meet on Sunday <pb n="160" facs="0191" xml:id="pg_160"/>and <hi rend="italic">expressed my concern
                            about the current situation</hi>, saying that I believe we may be
                        running out of time.</p>
                    <p>I also told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that I was
                        concerned about the <hi rend="italic">infusion of Libyan arms into
                            Palestinian areas</hi>. I said that such actions can only cause the
                        Israelis to react as they did today with a resulting increase in danger to
                        stability in the region.</p>
                    <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that we had received
                        stronger reports from other sources <hi rend="italic">suggesting the
                            presence of a Soviet adviser in Lebanon</hi>. When <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> challenged this again, I said we
                        had evidence that the advisers had been sheep-dipped to give them cover.</p>
                    <p>On Nicaragua, I told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that we
                        continue to see shipments of arms into Nicaragua manufactured in the Soviet
                        Union and Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>On <hi rend="italic">
                     <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> stated that the Soviets
                            were very anxious to get on with the talks</hi>. I told him that the
                        talks we will conduct between now and when <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and I meet in September will be restricted to the
                        modalities. I explained that the US had to engage in extensive consultations
                        with its allies and prepare threat and requirements assessments so that when
                        we begin negotiations we will know which systems will be involved. The
                            <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> talks are not like the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> talks where the US could act largely
                        unilaterally. I argued that both we and the Soviets will be well served by
                        these intensive preparations so that my discussions with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> in September can be productive and
                        businesslike.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
                    <p>I carefully studied your letter of April 24. And I will tell you right away
                        of my appreciation of the frank expression of your views and feelings as
                        well as the principle directions of your Administration’s foreign policy. It
                        is in the same spirit of frankness that I want to give you my reply
                        believing that clarifying mutually the positions of each other has an
                        important significance in developing a dialogue between us. This, as I
                        understand, corresponds to your intentions too.</p>
                    <pb n="161" facs="0192" xml:id="pg_161"/>
                    <p>Your letter, regrettably, is based upon a general premise of the Soviet Union
                        being responsible for the tensions existing in the world. Such a premise not
                        only is at variance with the factual state of affairs, but leads away from
                        the real causes behind the current situation, and, thus, can only make it
                        more difficult to find ways to eliminate those causes in order to remove the
                        tensions.</p>
                    <p>All assertions concerning a Soviet military threat or our alleged search for
                        military superiority do not become any more convincing through having them
                        repeated. Aims and intentions which are not ours must not be ascribed to us.
                        After all, we set our goals ourselves. And we, for our part, say in no
                        uncertain terms: the Soviet Union did not have and has no intentions to
                        achieve military superiority. We have no need for it.</p>
                    <p>Our actions in the field of assuring our country’s defense capability—and we
                        are doing nothing beyond that—have always been only a forced reaction in
                        response to the military programs carried out in the West. Indeed, it is a
                        generally recognized fact that every new spiral in the arms race has been
                        initiated by the United States. And what is typical is that each time such
                        thrusts were accompanied by vociferous outcries about the “Soviet military
                        threat”, about the US “lagging behind” on a particular kind of weapon. True,
                        it would be admitted later on in a whisper that no “lagging behind” had in
                        fact taken place, that someone, as it were, had made a “wrong calculation”.
                        But, by then, what was done was done, new weapon systems had been deployed
                        and the quantity of arms amassed had been significantly increased. This is
                        what the facts testify to, and, indeed, they are accessible to everyone.</p>
                    <p>We are witnessing today an active propagation of the thesis that the alleged
                        “imbalance of forces” has occurred and that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> entertains some “sinister intentions”. Your predecessors,
                        however, including the President whom you succeeded, recognized that there
                        was a parity in the military area between the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>, between the
                        East and the West. Does it mean that all depends on who does the
                        counting?</p>
                    <p>It is not in the Soviet Union at all that huge military budgets are being
                        adopted and programs are being started on an unprecedented scale to produce
                        new weapon systems, which does not only exceed the defense requirements but
                        reasonable limits in general. Again, it is not in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> that demands are being made to rescind
                        agreements reached earlier on arms limitation, that the intention is loudly
                        proclaimed to surpass militarily all other states, that a definite status is
                        being given to doctrines envisaging the possibility of delivering the first
                        strike and waging “limited” wars with the use of nuclear weapons. And that
                        is precisely the way it is.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, it is not our side that should be urged to exercise restraint. The
                        Soviet Union is not for the competition in armaments, <pb n="162" facs="0193" xml:id="pg_162"/>nor is it for their endless build-up. We
                        stand for the preservation of the existing parity in the military-strategic
                        area, which is the most important guarantee of peace and stability of all
                        peoples, as well as for a gradual reduction of the arms level on the basis
                        of the principle of equality and equal security of either side.</p>
                    <p>Nor is there any ground, Mr. President, to charge us with having the
                        intention to obtain some unilateral advantages anywhere in the world, to
                        call into doubt our commitment to the principles embodied in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter, in the Helsinki Final Act or in the
                        Basic Principles of Relations between the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the USA. This simply does not square with the
                        facts.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union is resolutely against interference in the affairs of other
                        peoples, against imposing someone else’s will on them. But we are also
                        against anybody arrogating to himself such a right, and when attempts to
                        this effect take place we are invariably on the side of the peoples who
                        stand up for their own independence.</p>
                    <p>I will address myself briefly to certain specific questions raised in your
                        letter.</p>
                    <p>You speak positively of our consent to have the zone of application of
                        confidence-building measures in the military area substantially expanded, to
                        include also all of the European part of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. However, the Western participants of the Madrid meeting,
                        including the USA, have up to now been evading the answer to the question
                        what they, for their part, are ready to do in this connection on the basis
                        of reciprocity.</p>
                    <p>It is to be hoped that the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> will take a
                        more constructive position at the Madrid meeting both on the question of
                        convening a conference on military detente and disarmament in Europe and on
                        the other questions being discussed there, and that it will, thereby,
                        demonstrate its intention to reckon with the hopes of peoples for the
                        continuation and development of the process of strengthening security and
                        cooperation in Europe in accordance with the Final Act.</p>
                    <p>It is a matter of regret that the USA reacted negatively to our proposal to
                        place a moratorium on deployments of new medium-range nuclear missile
                        systems in Europe by the countries of the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.
                        References made in this respect to the necessity of deploying new American
                        medium-range missiles in Western Europe in order to off-set some sort of
                        “superiority” of the Soviet Union simply are not borne out by the actual
                        state of affairs. One might believe that there exist no numerous American
                        forward-based nuclear systems in Europe and near it which are capable of
                        reaching the territory of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> or that
                        the nuclear weapons of the US <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies
                        have suddenly disappeared. But all that is there, indeed, and we can in no
                        way close our eyes to it.</p>
                    <pb n="163" facs="0194" xml:id="pg_163"/>
                    <p>The objective approach, the principle of equality and equal security require
                        that in making an analysis of the situation one should not limit himself to
                        any single type of weapon, but should see the nuclear potentials in a
                        comprehensive way. A true reflection of the factual state of affairs can be
                        found only in that approach. And this state of affairs is such that the
                        Soviet nuclear weapons in Europe do not exceed the aggregate level of the
                        nuclear systems of the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> group and,
                        therefore, there exists now in Europe an approximate parity in the
                        respective types of weapons. The replacement by the Soviet Union of the old
                        missiles by the modernized ones has not changed the situation. Accordingly,
                        the moratorium that we propose would merely freeze the existing approximate
                        parity, making it easier to reach agreement on the ways to reduce the level
                        of that parity. We noted that on more than one occasion you expressed
                        yourself in favor of such a reduction.</p>
                    <p>We cannot view the US desire to station in any case its new missiles in
                        Western Europe as anything but the intention to disrupt the strategic parity
                        and to achieve superiority. It goes without saying that we will have to
                        react to it in a proper way. But wouldn’t it be worthwhile giving a thought
                        whether such a turn of events will reinforce anybody’s security, including
                        that of the USA? We are convinced it will not.</p>
                    <p>This is the reason why we call upon the US Administration and you personally
                        to weigh up again, realistically and with all factors in mind, the
                        developing situation and to take steps in order to open the way toward
                        achieving through negotiations an effective limitation and reduction of
                        nuclear arms in Europe. Given the will on both sides, it is possible, I
                        believe, to reach this goal.</p>
                    <p>A few words on Poland. It appears that some sinister plans on the part of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> are perceived by Washington in
                        everything, and sometimes there is even talk on the possibility of some
                        “internal aggression” in Poland. A question is in order—what at all is meant
                        by the “internal aggression”? Is it possible, for example, that the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> can commit an aggression against
                        itself?</p>
                    <p>Earlier I already expressed to you our position as well as our assessment of
                        the US behaviour with regard to Poland. It remains the same. The United
                        States must in no way interfere in the Polish domestic affairs.</p>
                    <p>The United States stated on more than one occasion that it would not like to
                        see the Soviet troops in Afghanistan. It is, in fact, this idea with regard
                        to Afghanistan that is present in your letter too. But the Soviet troops are
                        there not just because we want it to be so. We repeated many times that we
                        would withdraw our limited military contingent, provided the aggression
                        against Afghanistan was ceased and a political settlement of the
                        international aspects of the Afghan problem was found. Should the United
                        States be really willing to facilitate such a <pb n="164" facs="0195" xml:id="pg_164"/>development, it could certainly do much in this
                        direction. Mentioning the negative position of the Pakistan leadership
                        doesn’t change a thing. It is well known why Islamabad under various
                        artificial pretexts is now avoiding negotiations with Kabul.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, in a detailed manner and in the spirit of frankness I have
                        laid down the thoughts which came to me in connection with your letter. I
                        believe this will be useful both for additional clarification of the
                        proposals that had been put forward in my letter of March 6 and for your
                        better understanding of the Soviet position on certain pressing
                        international issues, as well as on questions concerning the relations
                        between our countries.</p>
                    <p>I hope that our exchange of views as well as the discussions at other levels
                        will help find mutually acceptable solutions which would constitute our
                        common contribution to the strengthening of peace. In this regard I take
                        note of the assurances contained in your letter that the United States is
                        vitally interested in the peaceful resolution of international tensions and
                        that your Administration is prepared to settle disagreements by
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> says that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> tries to match the constructive
                        tone of your letter and has the impression that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s letter conveys a sense of substantial nervousness
                        and concern. The Secretary’s memorandum also describes his conversation with
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>, who delivered the
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> reply, which touched
                        upon U.S.-Soviet relations, Lebanon and issues for U.S.-Soviet
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The following is an analysis of the <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> reply prepared by the Soviet specialists on the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staff:</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s response to your <hi rend="italic">personal</hi>, handwritten letter is conciliatory in tone
                        and unbending in substance. It ignores a number of specific points made in
                        your handwritten note, including your assertion that governments must serve
                        the people and not the other way around. He makes no reference to your
                        allusion to Cuban actions in Angola, nor to the Soviet invasion of
                        Afghanistan (except to blame the United States for offering help to those
                        resisting it). He does not even mention your lifting the grain embargo,
                        which in your letter was presented as an act of good will.</p>
                    <p>Instead, he gives the standard litany of Soviet objections to “aggressive”
                        U.S. policies since 1945, such as the founding of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> (apparently without any cause), trying to dominate other
                        countries through economic aid, and perpetuating the arms race. All these
                        are arguments drawn from the classical Stalinist repertoire of anti-American
                        accusations presented here for the ostensible reason of making you
                        understand that Moscow has a legitimate “different” point of view.</p>
                    <p>Three items in the letter and in the remarks <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> made when delivering it deserve emphasis:</p>
                    <pb n="166" facs="0197" xml:id="pg_166"/>
                    <p>1. Once again <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> calls for a
                        summit as a vehicle for resolving outstanding differences.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> firmly rejects the
                        principle of “linkage” in U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> seems to link the recent
                        events in Lebanon to the need to have the Soviet Union involved in a general
                        Middle Eastern peace settlement.</p>

                            the Department requested that the Embassy convey to <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> the message: “Official channels
                            of U.S.-Soviet communication have been and remain open, both in
                            Washington and Moscow. Additional official or semi-official channels are
                            neither necessary nor desirable.” (Department of State, Central Foreign

               </p>
                    <p>1. (C—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. I delivered the message contained in para 4 <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> to <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> during
                        a private meeting the afternoon of June 2. After I went over the points with
                        him orally (I gave him nothing in writing), he seized upon the final one
                        (that additional official or semi-official channels are neither necessary
                        nor desirable and feigned perplexity about what this means. “Is it a
                        suggestion that I not express my views to American friends?” He inquired. I
                        assured him that it meant nothing more than it said, whereupon he claimed
                        never to have made such a suggestion—indeed, he added, he was quite opposed
                        to the idea of doing official business through other than official channels,
                        and wondered aloud how such a suggestion could have been attributed to him.
                        I told him that I could only infer that some of his American interlocutors
                        had interpreted something he said as constituting such a suggestion, but
                        that in any case there should now be no misunderstanding on either side
                        regarding the matter.</p>
                    <pb n="167" facs="0198" xml:id="pg_167"/>
                    <p>3. He then proceeded to comment on other points in the message as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>—To the comment that the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                        administration is still elaborating the details of its policy, he observed
                        that these may be details from the U.S. point of view, but some are quite
                        basic for the Soviets. For example, the administration’s attitude toward
                        strategic arms limitation is still not clear to the Soviet leadership, but
                        the conviction is growing that there is no genuine interest.<note n="3" xml:id="d61fn3">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> underlined
                            “there is no genuine interest” and wrote in the margin:
                        “speech!”</note>
               </p>
                    <p>—Regarding the principles of reciprocity and restraint, he said that his
                        concern centered on the way these concepts were being used: Reciprocity
                        could be employed as a pretext to dismantle the remaining ties between the
                        two countries; as for restraint, this seemed to mean only that Soviet
                        defense of its interests should be restrained.</p>
                    <p>—On linkage, he expressed doubt that it would result in practice in anything
                        other than a rationalization for not making progress in any area, since a
                        pretext for doing nothing can always be found somewhere.</p>
                    <p>—With some irony in his voice, he expressed pleasure at hearing that U.S.
                        policy is not based on “anti-Sovietism,” but added that he was quite
                        convinced that some senior members of the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> administration based their advice precisely on
                        anti-Sovietism.</p>
                    <p>4. I replied to each of these observations in turn, pointing out, for
                        example, that the President and Secretary had made clear their deep interest
                        in genuine arms reduction, that neither reciprocity nor restraint were
                        pretexts for something else but necessary in a relationship where benefits
                        had been one-sided and restraint notable by its absence in such instances as
                        the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, that “linkage” reflects recognition of
                        the basic political reality that Soviet behavior will have an impact on all
                        elements of the relationship, and that he was making a serious mistake if he
                        confused legitimate U.S. concern over Soviet actions and policies with
                        doctrinaire “anti-Sovietism.”</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> then dropped further
                        discussion of these points and expressed great anxiety over the present
                        state of U.S.-Soviet relations, saying that there is no real communication
                        and that we are not in a good position to manage crises which could arise
                        unexpectedly. “If a Yom Kippur war occurred today, I’m not sure a serious
                        confrontation could be avoided,” he observed, and added that there is
                        potential for such crises developing suddenly at many points, such as
                        Lebanon and Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>6. I told him that I was confident that communication was quite adequate so
                        long as there is a genuine Soviet desire to defuse problems, <pb n="168" facs="0199" xml:id="pg_168"/>but it is the latter that I often found
                        lacking. The conversation continued along predictable lines, with <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> trotting out his now familiar
                        arguments that the policies of the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> administration run the risk of convincing the Soviet
                        leaders that there is no U.S. intent to deal “constructively” with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> on any issue, but that there is a
                        calculated U.S. policy of stirring up fear of the Soviet Union to justify
                        massive military spending. I suggested to him that he would serve his
                        profession and his government better if he made a more serious effort to
                        understand why the American Government, and the American people, feel as
                        they do about U.S.-Soviet relations, and how Americans attitudes had been
                        formed by Soviet actions and policies—which now must be changed if improved
                        relations are to be possible.</p>
                    <p>7. Comment: Despite <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>’s
                        disingenuousness (to apply the kindest term possible) in denying having
                        suggested a special channel of communication, he could not have missed
                        message. I doubt, however, that this will put an end to his efforts to
                        establish himself as a key interlocutor in the U.S.-Soviet dialogue. His
                        other comments were largely identical with those he has served up to
                        visiting Americans over the past couple of months. His visitors are likely
                        to hear more of the same over the coming months.</p>

                    <p>We seek your approval of the attached Executive Summary of the East-West
                        Policy study, your decision on the one remaining disagreement within the
                        Department, and your authorization to circulate the full study so that we

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">ESSENTIAL FACTORS</p>
                    <p>Having passed the 4-month mark, the Administration now needs to pull together
                        the various strands of its East-West policy into one coherent strategic
                        approach. This is important for sustaining a consistent posture toward
                        East-West relations over the next few years. It is also necessary for
                        building allied consensus and in generating support at home for our policy.
                        We believe that the attached study contributes to filling these needs and
                        also provides the basis for a major East-West speech by you or the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>This study incorporates comments from throughout the Department and already
                        reflects considerable interagency work. We anticipate support from the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staff and the Pentagon, although
                        some specific points of difference may still surface. With your approval,
                            <persName corresp="#p_NL_1">Larry</persName> will convene an <gloss target="#t_IG_1">IG</gloss> meeting to complete the work in preparation
                        for the <gloss target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss>, and then we will move this
                        project rapidly to the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>.</p>

                        marginal effects on Soviet behavior, might push the Soviets into a more
                        autarkic position, and could engender some discord with allies reluctant to
                        support a program of tough new controls which are not directly related to
                        security concerns. <hi rend="italic">

                        well as subsidized credits. The study acknowledges that improved allied
                        behavior in this area will be evolutionary and must be managed in such a way
                        as to avoid serious allied discord.</p>

                     <hi rend="roman">I.</hi> Overview: The Present
                        Situation and Future Prospects</p>
                    <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">The Soviet-American relationship will be entering a new and
                            dangerous phase during the coming decade</hi>, independent of any major
                        US policy changes. Increased Soviet power threatens the free and open
                        international order the US has sought to maintain throughout the postwar
                        period. <hi rend="italic">The most urgent dangers are: (1) Soviet use of its
                            own and proxy forces</hi> to acquire new strategic advantages,
                        particularly <hi rend="italic">in politically unstable but vital regions;
                            and (2) Soviet efforts to divide the US from its major allies</hi>
                        through a combination of threats and inducements.</p>
                    <p>In this setting, <hi rend="italic">our East-West policy will be based on the
                            following premises</hi>: (1) that the <hi rend="italic">East-West
                            competition reflects fundamental and enduring conflicts of interests,
                            purpose and outlook</hi>; (2) that <hi rend="italic">the US should move
                            beyond its passive post-Vietnam foreign policy</hi> and provide greater
                        leadership to enable the West to compete more effectively; (3) that over the
                        near term, given the legacy we have inherited, <hi rend="italic">we often
                            will have to compete with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            under unfavorable circumstance;</hi> and (4) <hi rend="italic">some
                            degree of cooperation with Moscow is possible and desirable</hi> and can
                        help to sustain a consensus both at home and abroad in favor of a more
                        competitive posture.</p>
                    <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Our ability to meet this challenge will have to be based on
                            a long-term effort to rebuild American and Western power</hi> and
                        willingness to assume higher risks in defending our interests. We cannot
                        reverse trends favoring the Soviet Union overnight; to do so at all will
                        require considerable patience and resourcefulness. In the short term, we
                        must make use of our existing assets more efficiently by <hi rend="italic">taking advantage of special areas of American and Western
                        strength</hi>, <hi rend="italic">while exploiting Soviet weaknesses and
                            vulnerabilities</hi>.</p>
                    <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">US global strategy must</hi> improve our position by
                        joining American strength to that of allied and friendly countries. We
                        should <hi rend="italic">draw on an <pb n="172" facs="0203" xml:id="pg_172"/>informal but interlocking coalition of European and Asian allies, our
                            strategic association with China, and our partnerships with key “Third
                            World” countries.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">US</hi> must be the fulcrum
                        of this structure, providing the <hi rend="italic">leadership</hi> needed to
                        integrate Western assets and defend vital Western interests. On this basis
                        we <hi rend="italic">can ensure a sustainable internationalist US foreign
                            policy for the 1980s</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Naturally <hi rend="italic">the Soviet Union will act vigorously to protect
                            and expand its position against a newly assertive American foreign
                            policy</hi>; it has a great many instruments for doing so. <hi rend="italic">We should avoid mindless confrontations</hi> and take
                        account of vital Soviet interests in devising means for countering
                        aggressive Soviet behavior. <hi rend="italic">But this should not keep us
                            from competing forcefully</hi> with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in defense of our own interests. We cannot buy time by
                        accommodation; such a course also would mislead our public and our allies as
                        to our purposes and steadfastness. Moscow is likely in any case to take
                        actions that challenge our interests and <hi rend="italic">the costs of
                            accepting the aggressive Soviet posture are simply too high</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">long-term weaknesses of the Soviet Union</hi>, the
                        economic and political strengths of the West and the mandate embodied in the
                        November elections encourage us to believe that <hi rend="italic">an
                            effective policy toward the Soviet Union is within our reach as long as
                            we make full use of our strengths</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Yet the
                            material costs and political difficulties must not be understated</hi>.
                        Large and continuing economic burdens for defense must be patiently and
                        skillfully defended before the Congress and the public. We will have to
                        create and enlarge relationships with states that are critical Soviet
                        targets or strategically decisive. Finally, <hi rend="italic">regaining the
                            initiative will sometimes require that we accept immediate risks in
                            order to avoid greater albeit more long-term ones</hi>. For example,
                        security assistance to Pakistan at this time can avoid more serious problems
                        later.</p>
                    <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">A strong consensus both at home and abroad will be crucial
                            to sustaining these policies</hi>. We also will have to take the lead on
                        issues of critical importance, without letting uncertainty over the extent
                        of domestic or allied support deprive us of essential freedom of action. <hi rend="italic">Success will depend on a strong sense of priorities and on
                            effective leadership</hi>.</p>

                        Weaknesses</p>
                    <p>Management of the East-West relationship requires a dispassionate tallying of
                        Moscow’s strengths and weaknesses. <hi rend="italic">Over the near term, the
                            Soviet Union possesses several distinct advantages</hi> in its
                        competition with the United States: First, it enjoys, and in the short term
                        will increase its <hi rend="italic">significant military advantages</hi> in
                        key regions, accompanied by a greatly improved nuclear balance; second, <hi rend="italic">it is in a position to exploit instability in many areas
                            of the developing world</hi> crucial to Western interests, <hi rend="italic">particularly the Persian Gulf</hi>; third, it has built up
                        a <hi rend="italic">network of allies, clients and proxies throughout the
                            Third World</hi>; fourth, from their recent use, <hi rend="italic">Soviet <pb n="173" facs="0204" xml:id="pg_173"/>armed forces</hi> and
                        those of its allies and proxies <hi rend="italic">are gaining operational
                            self-confidence</hi> and an enhanced capacity for intimidation; fifth,
                        it can play upon <hi rend="italic">a residual Western attachment to
                            detente</hi> to separate the US from its allies; and sixth, Moscow can
                        pursue its objectives in <hi rend="italic">relative freedom from domestic
                            political constraints and dependence on foreign resources</hi>.</p>
                    <p>At the same time the <hi rend="italic">Soviets</hi> must contend with a
                        number of <hi rend="italic">liabilities:</hi> First, <hi rend="italic">Soviet economic growth will continue to stagnate</hi> in this decade
                        for reasons inherent in the system itself; second, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is on the verge of a <hi rend="italic">wholesale leadership change</hi> that could hamper the conduct of
                        foreign policy; third, the Soviets face the <hi rend="italic">hostility of
                            all the industrial democracies and China</hi>; fourth, the Soviets will
                        increasingly suffer from <hi rend="italic">imperial overextension</hi>, as
                        reflected by the weaknesses of Soviet proxies and dependents and by the
                        instability of Eastern Europe; and finally, <hi rend="italic">Marxism-Leninism is a bankrupt ideology</hi> which fails to answer the
                        needs either of the working class it is meant to serve or of the developing
                        nations in the Third World.</p>
                    <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Unfortunately, these long-term liabilities do not lessen
                            the dangers that we now face or permit a more passive US attitude
                            towards Moscow</hi>. Indeed, the <hi rend="italic">combination of
                            short-term strengths and long-term weakness may prompt the Soviets to
                            capitalize on their advantage now. The Soviets may regard the energy
                            vulnerability of the West and their own ability to exploit military
                            power for political purposes in the Persian Gulf area as an opportunity
                            of historic proportions to cripple the Western</hi> alliance once and
                        for all. Moscow’s long-term problems will be of little benefit to us unless
                        we can defend our interests over the short-run and establish trends
                        favorable to us.</p>

                  </p>

                        military balance.</p>
                    <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Because military power is a necessary basis for competing
                            with the Soviets effectively, US forces will have to be increased across
                            the board</hi>. The Soviets have widened their existing superiority in
                        conventional forces in Europe, Asia and the broad Persian Gulf/Middle East
                        region, supplementing them with a network of proxies in the Third World.
                        This has occurred against the backdrop of a shift in the strategic and
                        theater nuclear balances, which weakens deterrence and the US strategic
                        commitments on which it is based.</p>
                    <p>Military modernization must emphasize the <hi rend="italic">procurement of
                            systems which take advantage of American strengths and exploit Soviet

                    <p>• <hi rend="italic">Nuclear Forces</hi>. <hi rend="italic">The overall
                            nuclear balance is not satisfactory, and our programs of strategic and
                            theater modernization are not yet, even in combination, adequate to
                            redress the balance. At a minimum we need to restore the nuclear
                            balance</hi> and to improve the ability of these forces to support US
                        deterrent commitments. Nuclear force improvements should be gauged not
                        simply by static quantitative measures, but also by qualitative factors,
                        such as <gloss target="#t_C3I_1">C3I</gloss>, that have a practical military
                        significance, i.e., that provide enduring capability to destroy targets of
                        military significance.</p>
                    <p>• <hi rend="italic">Regional Forces. The forces of the US and its allies are
                            insufficient to meet common security needs. Accordingly, the US must
                            modernize and expand its conventional force structure with emphasis on
                            four areas</hi>. First, in cooperation with our allies and regional
                        nations, we must work to <hi rend="italic">create capabilities adequate to
                            meet the full array of Soviet and regional threats, above all in the
                            Persian Gulf area</hi>. We must improve our own capability to utilize
                        access to local facilities already obtained, working steadily for gradual
                        increases as regional nations gain more confidence in us. Second, <hi rend="italic">we must reverse the deterioration of regional
                            balances</hi> in Europe and Asia. Third, the US must establish an
                        improved margin of <hi rend="italic">maritime superiority to put at risk the
                            global Soviet navy and to strengthen our capacity to manage the regional
                            crises</hi>. Finally, the US should improve its <hi rend="italic">arms
                            transfer capability</hi> by making additional resources available on a
                        timely basis <hi rend="italic">to meet the needs of regional allies</hi>
                        threatened by the Soviets or their proxies.</p>
                    <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">The US should pursue a realistic arms control policy</hi>
                        aimed at verifiable agreements that can enhance national security by
                        limiting those Soviet systems which are most threatening to us and by
                        reducing the risk of war or reducing its destructiveness if war occurs.
                        Disarmament or restrictions on new technologies for their own sake should be
                        eschewed, as well as agreements negotiated simply to improve the atmosphere

                        arms and arms technology to China. Referring to the explanation of our

                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> on June 10, the Soviet
                        statement recalled earlier assurances given the Soviets by the US side,
                        including at the highest level, and said that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> should be aware that to proceed to arm the Chinese despite
                        such assurances would be regarded as “outright hostile” toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. I told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> I would inform you
                        of the Soviet statement and that, if after careful study we had any further
                        comment, we would be in touch with him.</p>
                    <p>4. Text of the Soviet “oral statement,” which <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> left as a non paper, follows:</p>
                    <p>Begin text:</p>
                    <p>—Careful study has been given in Moscow to the explanation furnished by the
                        US side concerning its position on the sales of military equipment to China.
                        Although the formulations used is (sic) of a deliberately vague nature, the
                        sense of the explanation amounts to the fact that the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> allows for the possibility of transferring
                        arms and arms technology to China.</p>
                    <p>—We assume that the current American leadership is familiar with the
                        exchanges that took place between our countries on the subject of China and
                        of the assurances in this regard given to us by the US side at various
                        levels including the highest one.</p>
                    <p>—Therefore, the US Government should be aware of the kind of responsibility
                        the United States of America would incur by taking, in spite of the said
                        assurances, the path of arming China—a path which <pb n="181" facs="0212" xml:id="pg_181"/>is fraught with the most serious consequences for the
                        peace and international stability.</p>
                    <p>—Such behavior of the US side would be regarded in no other way but as being
                        outright hostile toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. It
                        should be clear to the US Government that its practical steps in providing
                        China with arms, military equipment and technology will be properly taken
                        into account by us in the overall context of Soviet-American relations, and
                        that in this case the Soviet Union would be free to take such measures as
                        would be dictated by the emerging situation. End text.</p>

                        It is devoid of the vituperative elements present in many Soviet notes when
                        they have an essentially propagandistic purpose. This is a serious warning
                        and I would be inclined to take it very seriously. It would seem to me to
                        call for a high-level meeting with Soviet representatives either here or in
                        Moscow to clarify both U.S. policies in China and the implications of the
                        Soviet response. In particular, one would want to know what is meant by the
                        concluding phrase that the Soviet Government would “be free to take such
                        measures as would be dictated by the emerging situation”. It would be
                        dangerous, in my opinion, to handle this note in a routine manner, let alone
                        ignore it. (S)</p>

                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> invited me to lunch at the
                        Soviet residence June 23. He expressed great concern about the state of our
                        relations, saying U.S. policy seemed to be completely anti-Soviet, aimed at
                        confrontation and at encirclement of the Soviet Union. He claimed that
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> genuinely desires a
                        better relationship and wants to discuss all problems, but that we
                        consistently rebuff him. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> was
                        also perturbed about our decision concerning arms sales to China. I reviewed
                        our positions about Soviet behavior and military build-up, saying we desire
                        a more stable relationship but emphasizing that this can only be achieved if
                        the Soviets demonstrate moderation and restraint. Details of our
                        conversation are set forth below: (<persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he would depart for the Soviet Union on leave

                        been complaining about the low level of his salary, and <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> was trying to check out what other
                        countries paid officials in that position. He said that <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> earned about $10,000 a year. I
                        said that this was low by our standards and that we would pay a senior
                        officer five times that much. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> claimed that his own salary as Ambassador was only
                        $12,000 and that, even though housing and everything else was taken care of
                        and that a certain amount of rubles was deposited in his account in Moscow,
                        he was finding it rather hard to get along on such a salary.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Central Committee Plenum?</p>
                    <p>When <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> referred to the meeting
                        that day of the Supreme Soviet, I mentioned that there apparently has not
                        been a meeting of the Central Committee Plenum before the Supreme Soviet and
                        that this seemed unprecedented. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that this was not unprecedented and that there
                        had been previous cases when a Plenum had not been called before a Supreme
                        Soviet meeting. So far as his own participation <pb n="183" facs="0214" xml:id="pg_183"/>in a Plenum meeting is concerned, he said that he does
                        not attend all meetings on a regular basis, but only those of an important
                        nature dealing with foreign affairs.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Outlook for Relations:</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked for my “professional
                        evaluation” of the situation between the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the prospects for further development. He said he
                        personally was very gloomy about the situation; the U.S. seemed to be on a
                        course of seeking confrontation with the Soviet Union, of encircling the
                        Soviet Union, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s
                        statements seemed increasingly and persistently anti-Soviet in content. He
                        also mentioned critical statements by the President concerning the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>In response, I said the situation was obviously not an easy one. The
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration is deeply
                        concerned about the Soviet military build-up and a pattern of Soviet
                        interventionism, noting in particular Afghanistan, Central America, support
                        of Vietnam in Kampuchea, and threats against Poland. I said we were
                        determined to do something about this situation, to be more active in
                        defending our own interests and those of our allies, to reassert our
                        leadership role and to demonstrate that the “Vietnam syndrome” was behind
                        us. However, I stressed that we did not seek a confrontation with the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>I noted that the overall thrust of this policy has the strong backing of the
                        American people as shown in the elections.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Arms Control:</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> made special reference to
                        arms control matters, saying he was also disturbed by prospects in this
                        regard. He said the Soviets know Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REV_1">Rostow</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowny</persName> and their negative views on arms control—the fact that
                        they will be in charge of negotiations is not promising. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> contrasted <persName corresp="#p_REV_1">Rostow</persName>’s statement that we would not be
                        prepared to talk <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> before nine months
                        with <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s appeal at the Supreme
                        Soviet for immediate and urgent talks on disarmament without
                        pre-conditions.</p>
                    <p>I drew attention to the preparations already under way for holding US-Soviet
                        negotiations on <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> before the end of the
                        year. I stressed that we were serious in our approach to these negotiations.
                        On <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, I referred to the statement by
                        the President of sincere interest in negotiations aimed at significant
                        reductions in strategic arms, but said that there was much work to be done
                        in preparing for such negotiations and that we did not wish to rush into
                        them prematurely.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> then embarked on a long
                        dissertation about the military balance between the U.S. and the Soviet
                        Union. He said that he had talked with Soviet experts on this subject,
                        including General Ogarkov, <pb n="184" facs="0215" xml:id="pg_184"/>and they
                        all felt that there was approximate parity between the two sides. The same
                        situation was true in Europe, where Soviet missiles, including the SS–20s,
                        were balanced off by a wide range of Western armament and forward based
                        systems capable of hitting the Soviet Union. In Europe, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> claimed that the balance between
                        East and West is 1.5 to 1 in favor of the West in terms of nuclear war
                        heads. He mentioned that the Soviets must include weapons based in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and in France in their
                        calculations.</p>
                    <p>In my comments, I stressed in particular the build-up of SS–20s by the Soviet
                        side as representing a new element in the military situation in Europe which
                        resulted in a serious imbalance. I also noted that Soviet S–4s and S–5s were
                        still in place and targeted against Western Europe rather than being reduced
                        in numbers as had been anticipated. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> contested this vigorously and said that S–4s and
                        S–5s are in the process of being reduced. I also mentioned the Backfire as
                        another item of concern for us; <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> countered with a reference to the F–111s stationed
                        in the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>. Entirely apart from the argument
                        over whether or not there is now a situation of approximate parity, I said
                        the trends were clearly against the U.S. in view of the continuing high
                        level of Soviet investment in military programs and, in particular, the
                        Soviet emphasis on more accurate, land based intercontinental missiles.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> again countered this
                        line of argument, saying that the view was entirely different from Moscow,
                        from where the U.S. still looked superior in many respects to the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> mentioned the Soviet proposal
                        for a moratorium on <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> systems, saying
                        that this concept had resulted from a “brain storming” session held at
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s dacha outside Moscow
                        last year. According to <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>, the
                        moratorium idea had been suggested to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> by working level officials and had then been
                        accepted by him against the advice of the military and others in the
                        Politburo. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> felt personally
                        attached to the idea and had been disappointed at the lack of response from
                        the U.S. regarding it. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> also
                        alluded vaguely to the idea that the moratorium concept could be applied in
                        the area of heavy missiles.</p>
                    <p>I explained our problems with the moratorium idea, saying it seemed clear
                        that such a step would simply freeze Soviet advantages and would stimulate
                        public pressures in the West on us to refrain from proceeding with our
                        efforts to catch up with the Soviets. In my view, the moratorium concept was
                        not a useful one and I thought it should not be pushed if the Soviets were
                        really serious about arms control negotiations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">China:</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> did not come on as strongly
                        about U.S. arms sales to China as I had anticipated. He expressed concern
                        and some puzzlement <pb n="185" facs="0216" xml:id="pg_185"/>about our
                        policy and said it seemed designed to be clearly provocative vis-a-vis the
                        Soviet Union. I noted that we would proceed in a careful, measured and
                        prudent way in connection with arms sales to China, handling every item on a
                        case by case basis. I thought it would be advisable for the Soviets to
                        withhold a definitive conclusion regarding our policy pending an opportunity
                        to see how it developed in practice.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Opportunities for Movement:</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> wondered whether I saw any
                        bright spots in a generally drab picture; were there any possibilities for
                        movement? I said it would be wrong to be optimistic in the present situation
                        and that much in our view depended on actions by the Soviet side. However, I
                        pointed to the <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> negotiations as one area
                        where there would be active contact and forward movement might be possible.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that,
                        realistically, he doubted if much would come out of the <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> negotiations, although he agreed it was
                        important to pursue them. I pointed to the current meeting of the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> in Geneva as evidence of continued
                        interest in the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> process, noting that
                        the U.S. stance at the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> was businesslike
                        and non-polemical. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        acknowledged that this was the case.</p>
                    <p>I also mentioned the <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> conversations and
                        the acceptance by the present Administration of the French proposal for
                            <gloss target="#t_CDE_1">CDE</gloss>, including Confidence Building
                        Measures from the Atlantic to the Urals. I thought this was an area where
                        forward movement would be possible, although I noted that the vague Soviet
                        demand for “appropriate” reciprocal measures on the part of the West was a
                        complicating factor. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said
                        the Soviets were waiting for Western proposals on this score and he could
                        not understand why we would have any objections. I stressed our position
                        that the Atlantic to the Urals concept should be sufficient for a conference
                        focused on security in Europe. When I said that we were also interested in
                        progress on human rights issues at the <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said this
                        is an old story and seems to be used by the West to block progress on
                        security issues. I denied that this was the case.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Middle East:</p>
                    <p>In a brief discussion on the Middle East, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he thought it would be possible for the U.S.
                        and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to work together in the area.
                        He recalled his earlier discussion several years ago with Joe Sisco, in the
                        course of which it had been agreed that we had a number of common points of
                        view. He thought it would be useful if we could conduct a similar exercise
                        since the way things were going now was dangerous and unproductive.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">US-Soviet Relations:</p>
                    <p>Toward the end of our conversation, I spoke frankly of the need for restraint
                        and moderation on the part of the Soviet Union if relations <pb n="186" facs="0217" xml:id="pg_186"/>are to improve. As examples, I noted that
                        it would be most helpful if the Soviets could do something to dampen
                        Castro’s increased activism in the Caribbean in support of change through
                        violence; I also said that an expression of real interest on the part of the
                        Soviet Union in moves leading to Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan would be
                        helpful.</p>
                    <p>In response, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> claimed that the
                        Soviets in fact have been restrained. He said that nothing drastic had
                        happened on the part of the Soviets since the inauguration of President
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> and that there had been
                        no “testing” of the President. He said that a lot of noise has been made
                        about Poland but that here, too, the Soviets have been restrained.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> reiterated Soviet unhappiness
                        that there has been no response on a whole series of proposals from
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> aimed at reducing
                        tension. He said that, on Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had made proposals but this, like all the others,
                        had been dismissed as propaganda. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said this was getting discouraging for the Soviets
                        and that those in the leadership pushing for a harder line toward the U.S.
                        were gaining strength as a result. He did not wish to overdo the “dove/hawk”
                        analogy as it applies to the Politburo, but he said that we should
                        understand that there is a division of opinion within the leadership and
                        that the hard liners are deriving support for their positions as a result of
                        U.S. policies.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> proposals,
                        I said that, speaking personally, it seemed to me that they all appeared to
                        be made in a propagandistic sense with a view to appealing to public
                        opinion. There were also so many proposals—not one of which appeared
                        particularly new—that skepticism about them was warranted. I suggested that,
                        if <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> really wanted to advance
                        a serious proposal on a given subject, it would be better to do so privately
                        without public fanfare. I repeated that we desired to have a better
                        relationship with the Soviets and genuinely to resolve problems between us.
                        It was necessary, however, to approach these matters seriously without the
                        aim of making propaganda and with a realistic appreciation of the position

                    <p>As I left, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that he would
                        be returning to Moscow on consultations July 14 and would be expected to
                        consult there in detail about prospects for US-Soviet relations. Before he
                        left, he hoped he would have the opportunity for a thorough discussion with
                        the Secretary. He emphasized again his concern about the present situation,
                        saying that half a year has gone by already and that, in his view, it is
                        urgent to enter into serious talks about our relationship.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that he had
                        participated in many important meetings between <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and American leaders, but that the forthcoming
                        meeting between the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would be the most important which had occurred since
                        he had been in Washington. There were many people in Moscow—and the number
                        was growing—who had concluded that we were entering into a period of real
                        hostility between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. The President had specifically
                        attacked the Soviet leadership, as had the Secretary. There had been
                        absolutely no progress in our relations in the five months since the new
                        Administration took office. The Secretary’s meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was thus looked upon in Moscow as a
                        sort of benchmark for determining whether there was to be any future to the
                        Soviet-American relationship.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he needed a direct
                        answer to a question: Is Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan an absolute
                        condition for any relationship with the Soviet Union? The Secretary
                        responded that Afghanistan was a profoundly important issue, as was
                        Kampuchea. Any assurances which the Soviets could give us—for example, with
                        regard to specific plans for a phased withdrawal from Afghanistan—would
                        clearly have an effect on our attitude toward relations with the Soviet
                        Union. At the same time, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        should take note of the fact that we had already broken <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> out of the complex of issues facing us and
                        agreed to negotiations. In the same context, the Secretary noted that we
                        would in due course have something to say about a future long term grains
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>It should be clear, the Secretary continued, that the pace of our dealings
                        with the Soviet Union would be affected by Soviet conduct in these two areas
                        (Afghanistan and Kampuchea), and also in two other areas—Iran and Poland. We
                        wanted good relations with the Soviet Union but could not simply put
                        Afghanistan behind us. We therefore hoped that there would be some evidence
                        of Soviet movement on Afghanistan when he met with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> in the fall.</p>
                    <pb n="188" facs="0219" xml:id="pg_188"/>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that the EC proposal for a conference on Afghanistan<note n="2" xml:id="d66fn2">Reference to a plan by the ten nations of the
                            European Community to hold an international conference to seek a formula
                            for Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. See Paul Lewis, “West Europeans
                            to Seek Soviet Pullout in Afghanistan,” <hi rend="italic">New York
                                Times</hi>, June 30, 1981, p. A3.</note> was a serious one,
                        non-polemical, and not an anti-Soviet gesture. The U.S. was prepared to help
                        in any way it could—but one thing had to be clear, that we could not agree
                        to the establishment of a puppet regime in Kabul that ignored the need for
                        reestablishing a non-aligned Afghanistan. We felt the same way about
                        Kampuchea. We had, for example, taken all the rhetoric out of the <gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss> resolution on Kampuchea,<note n="3" xml:id="d66fn3">A reference to the closing declaration at a June meeting
                            of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which called for a U.N.

                            rival Cambodian factions. See Henry Kamm, “Asian Parley Urges Cambodian

                        should either participate in the conference or come to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> with a proposal of their own.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> interrupted with a question
                        as to whether the Secretary thought the Soviets were really in control of
                        Vietnam, adding that the Vietnamese had not even informed the Soviets before
                        going into Kampuchea. The Secretary responded that, whether that was true or
                        not, it was clear that the Soviets were at least providing considerable
                        support to Vietnam. He had seen the evidence of what the Soviets were doing
                        at Cam Rahn Bay and of their growing presence elsewhere in Vietnam. This was
                        a fundamentally destabilizing development.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> raised the subject of
                        U.S.-China relations and gave the Secretary a non-paper on the subject.<note n="5" xml:id="d66fn5">Attached but not printed.</note> The Secretary
                        reminded <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that we had
                        informed the Soviets, before he left for his trip to China, that we were
                        changing the category in which we placed China to that of a friendly,
                        non-allied country. In effect, we were henceforth treating China basically
                        the same as Yugoslavia. We had previously told the Soviets also of our
                        strong objections to the Soviet supply of arms to Central America, and yet
                        that supply had not ceased. Recently the Soviets had provided Nicaragua—a
                        country with 2.5 million people—with a full batallion of tanks. On a pro
                        rata population basis, we would have to supply the Chinese with 5,000 to
                        6,000 tanks for any sort of equivalent action. We had warned the Soviets,
                        but they paid no attention to our warning. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> expostulated that we could have discussed the
                        matter, and the Secretary reminded him that we had discussed it on several
                        occasions.</p>
                    <pb n="189" facs="0220" xml:id="pg_189"/>
                    <p>Returning to subject of Kampuchea and Afghanistan, the Secretary said that
                        what we needed from the Soviets were constructive approaches. We would be
                        quite prepared to discuss such approaches, including transitional
                        arrangements pending a full settlement. Poland, he said, was a critical
                        case; if the Soviets were to go in, everything in Soviet-American relations
                        would go by the board. As for Iran, we were disturbed by Soviet propaganda
                        claims that we had responsibility for the recent bombing.<note n="6" xml:id="d66fn6">A reference to the June 29 bombing in Teheran of the

                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> claimed that Soviet radio
                        was only repeating what was being reported from Teheran. The Secretary
                        stated that that was not true and said he would send <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> a couple of examples of
                        particularly objectionable broadcasts. Non-intervention in Iran, the
                        Secretary continued, was absolutely essential to any future relationship
                        with the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked
                        what he thought would happen to the leftists in Iran, and the Secretary
                        responded that it appeared they would be going into a meat grinder.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> commented that they
                        already were. The Secretary stated that the United States was not involved
                        in events in Iran and expected the same of the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>On the subject of East-West trade, the Secretary commented that the Soviets
                        would find that we would be taking a reasonable position. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he had heard that we were
                        making plans to try to isolate the Soviets economically, and the Secretary
                        denied that that was true. There would in time be some movement, though much
                        would of course depend on Soviet conduct in other matters.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said it was essential that
                        the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> talk about
                        the Persian Gulf when they met in September. The Secretary responded that
                        there was no possibility of our taking any concerted action with the Soviets
                        concerning the Persian Gulf or the Middle East so long as the Soviets
                        remained in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>Asked what we planned to do about the <gloss target="#t_TTBT_1">TTBT</gloss>
                        and the <gloss target="#t_PNET_1">PNET</gloss>, the Secretary said the
                        matters were under review.</p>
                    <p>On <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked what our preference would be for a site for
                        negotiations. The Secretary said that we did not yet have a definite
                        position but probably would prefer Geneva. Asked about the relationship
                        between <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, the Secretary responded that these were clearly parallel
                        issues and that at some point the tracks would have to be integrated.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> in that connection

                        stress the importance of the initiatives on Afghanistan and Poland. I told
                        him that the EC conference proposal was a serious one, not an anti-Soviet
                        gesture, and stressed that the U.S. was prepared to help find a solution to
                        Afghanistan. The essential factor was that we would not agree to a puppet
                        regime in Kabul that ignored the reestablishment of a non-aligned
                        Afghanistan. On Kampuchea, I said we also viewed the forthcoming
                        international conference as a serious initiative and thought the Soviets
                        should either participate or come to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        with a proposal of their own. What was needed on both issues were
                        constructive approaches from the Soviets, which might include proposals for
                        transitional arrangements pending full settlement.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> described the mood in Moscow
                        as one of growing doubt as to where our relationship was headed and said my
                        forthcoming meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was
                        viewed as a benchmark in determining whether there was to be any future to
                        the U.S.-Soviet relationship. He said he needed to know whether we were
                        saying that Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan was an absolute condition for
                        any future relationship with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>I reminded <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that we had
                        already broken <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> out of the complex of
                        issues facing us and had agreed to negotiations, and that in due course we
                        would have something to say about a future long term grains agreement.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that he had heard
                        that we were planning to try to isolate the Soviets economically. I denied
                        that this was so, but said that future trade relations would of course be
                        affected by Soviet conduct in other matters. I added that it should be clear
                        that the pace of our dealings with the Soviets in all areas would be
                        affected by their conduct on the Afghanistan and Kampuchea issues—and also
                        by their conduct in two other areas of crucial importance, Iran and <pb n="191" facs="0222" xml:id="pg_191"/>Poland. It was vital to any future
                        relationship that there be no Soviet intervention in either of these
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> made another reference to the
                        Soviet Persian Gulf initiative by saying it was essential that we talk about
                        that area with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> in September.
                        I told him there was no possibility of any concerted U.S.-Soviet action
                        concerning either the Persian Gulf or the Middle East so long as the Soviets
                        remained in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>On arms control issues, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked
                        about our plans for Threshold Test Ban Treaty and Peaceful Nuclear
                        Explosions Treaty, and how we saw the relationship between <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. He was told that all these issues were under review.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> also raised the subject of
                        our relations with China. I am sending you a separate memo on this
                            subject.<note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3">See <ref target="#d69">Document

                            The meeting took place in the Cabinet Room at the White House. In a

                            recorded: “A lengthy N.S.C. meeting re trade with Soviet U. &amp; what
                            to do about the Soviet pipeline to W. Europe. A dozen options ranging
                            from almost total trade with restrictions only on extremely sensitive
                            mil. technology to almost total boycott. I have to choose one of the
                            options. Our allies of course lean toward trade.” (Brinkley, ed., <hi rend="italic">The <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>

                        of a letter he had recently received from a Navy man.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName>:</hi> The
                        items we will discuss today are of great importance. Mr. President, the
                        decisions you make based on today’s meeting or perhaps on two <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meetings this week will set the course of
                        our East-West Trade Policy and will be important in setting the course of
                        our relations with the Soviet Union. Our Allies and the Soviets will both
                        see these decisions as setting the course of our economic and strategic
                        trade policy.</p>
                    <p>We need decisions before the Ottawa Summit, so that we can inform our Allies
                        of our policies. The Summit countries together do more than 70 percent of
                        the West’s trade with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The issues to be discussed are complex and interrelated, ranging from our
                        Allied (<gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>) national security export
                        controls, through U.S. and Allied controls on Oil and Gas Equipment and
                        Technology and U.S. policy on the Siberian Pipeline, to the U.S. decision on
                        a specific export control case—the export of 100 Caterpillar pipelayers to
                        the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The complexity and breadth of the issues—heavy in both economic and security
                        context—required enlarging the Council for this topic.</p>
                    <p>Because of the complexity and enlarged attendance, this meeting will be
                        introductory, with a second meeting Thursday to deal with the detailed
                        issues in more detail.<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2">See <ref target="#d71">Document 71</ref>.</note>

                    <p>The objectives of this meeting are to determine the basic positions of each
                        agency and the key factors in reaching those positions, and to identify
                        differing views for examination in the second meeting.</p>
                    <p>The papers to be discussed can be divided into two groups.<note n="3" xml:id="d68fn3">
                     <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName> forwarded
                            the policy options papers to <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> under cover of a July 2 memorandum. (Reagan
                            Library, Executive Secretariat, <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>:
                            National Security Council Meeting File: Records, 1981–88, <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 00016)</note> The first deals with
                        Allied Security Controls. The remaining three papers deal with various
                        aspects of controls on Soviet energy development.</p>
                    <p>I would like to proceed as follows: In the first round each participant will
                        have two minutes to state his position on the options concerning National
                        Security Controls and to identify the major considerations in his decision.
                        Following that round, the President may wish to ask some questions. Again,
                        we will have to limit the comments to two minutes. Then, we can follow a
                        similar procedure for the second group of papers.</p>
                    <p>The first paper presents three options for strengthening security controls on
                        exports to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. These options would
                        tighten <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> security controls by
                        varying degrees. Each would require negotiations with our <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> allies to implement. The difficulty
                        and length of the negotiations would, of course, probably vary with the
                        degree of tightening of controls.</p>
                    <p>I suggest we begin with the statements of positions. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>, would you like to begin?</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi> Yes. It is important to know that we are dealing
                        with a group of interrelated—and sometimes contradictory issues; to
                        recognize that the decisions will affect both our relations with our Allies
                        and with the Soviets. It is also important in making our decision to balance
                        what we want against what we can do.</p>
                    <p>Option I maintains controls on equipment and technology and would be much as
                        the policy in recent years. Our Allies are comfortable with this policy and
                        it will be difficult to change it.</p>
                    <p>Option II would add to the controlled items equipment and technology <hi rend="italic">critical</hi> to military related industries; for example,
                        shipbuilding and heavy equipment.</p>
                    <p>Option III would control <hi rend="italic">all</hi> military relevant
                        technology.</p>
                    <p>I believe we should elect Option II, which would significantly broaden
                        restraints. It will be difficult to do this. For two years we have been
                        negotiating in <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> to make a narrow
                        increase in militarily relevant metallurgical technology with little result.
                        Selling Option II to our Allies will be very difficult. We should seek at
                        the Summit <pb n="194" facs="0225" xml:id="pg_194"/>meeting a subsequent
                        high-level <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> meeting. At the same
                        time as we increase these controls, we should loosen up on lower level
                        controls.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>:</hi> We must consider our Allies’ position,
                        but we must consider whether we wish to aid the Soviets or not, and we must
                        not adopt the attitude that if we don’t sell to them someone else will. This
                        is sometimes true, but our policy should be very restrictive. Almost
                        everything aids their military and helps their economy. We know that they
                        will only be satisfied by world domination, and we cannot satisfy them by
                        appeasing them.</p>
                    <p>We should not give in to the argument that “if we don’t, others will.” To go
                        along with this weakens our ability to lead and to not supply them.</p>
                    <p>While Option III is not considered feasible, following Option I should be
                        discontinued. Option II is an improvement, but will still continue to help
                        the Soviets. There will be slippages. We should strengthen Option II by an
                        ad hoc examination of things under Option III. They turn against us what we
                        provide them.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName>:</hi> Mr. President, we have to have a program that
                        works. The present program does not work. We have 5,000 applications in
                        process. Some 2,000 are legally overdue. Our business people—and our
                        Allies—do not understand our current policy.</p>
                    <p>I think we should go for Option II—tighten controls at the top (the higher
                        technology)—loosening at the bottom on routine items. With fewer items to
                        process, we can process them faster and give more attention to the more
                        important items at the top.</p>
                    <p>For example, robots are not on the list now. We would deny some under Option
                        II, but the simple “pick and place” robots would go.</p>
                    <p>Super alloys—there are some 2,000 of them. We can’t control all of them. We
                        would deny the vacuum induction furnaces and technology used to make them,
                        but not the items themselves.</p>
                    <p>We have the same kind of problem with computers. We would differentiate
                        between the important and the not important—allow shipments of items that
                        can be had from electronic stores.</p>
                    <p>We believe we could update the <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>
                        regulations by October.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DWK_1">Davis</persName>:</hi> I note that restrictions on atomic energy
                        items would be continued under any of these options. We lean to Option II.
                        However, denial may stimulate their own research to develop capabilities in
                        the long term they otherwise would not have if dependent on imports.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWE_1">Brock</persName>:</hi> I follow <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Mac
                            (Baldrige)</persName> in his recommendations. I feel we should ship
                        almost anything in hardware—deny the technology. That way we can freeze them
                        into a position five to ten years behind us.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWJ_1">Casey</persName>:</hi> It
                        is a mistake to help the Soviets by exporting to them items they need. There
                        is a greater negative impact from the exports than positive economic value
                        to us as an export. We should be concerned not only about technology, but
                        also about products.</p>
                    <p>We should go as close to Option III as our Allies will allow.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">General <persName corresp="#p_JDC_1">Jones</persName>:</hi>
                        We should impose the tightest possible controls. The policy should be
                        somewhere between Options II and III.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD_1">Stockman</persName>:</hi> I
                        prefer Option II, but would urge the tightest possible analytical framework
                        as to the effects of the option. We need an estimate of the cost to the
                        Soviets in terms of the impact on military investment and the linkage of our
                        policy to their economic expansion.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KJJ_1">Kirkpatrick</persName>:</hi> We need to be concerned about the
                        impact of our policies on our Allies. But we also need to be concerned about
                        their impact on the rest of the world. Strengthening Soviet capabilities
                        increases their power around the world and their ability to interfere. I
                        don’t believe that denying exports to them will increase their ability to
                        innovate on their own. We should force them to divert productive capacity to
                        developing their own technology. We should follow Option II, plus an
                        item-by-item analysis.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> I do have a question. The Caterpillar

                    <p>Under Option III, they would not go.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> Is all this predicated on dealing with
                        our Allies? It is not much to us economically, but, for example, the whole

                        need to go to the Gulf. But does Western Europe become more dependent?</p>

                        Your decision would be a fit topic for the Summit. We all agree on the need
                        to strengthen controls. The vehicle used (to approach the Allies) will be
                        critical. As Al said, your decisions will have tremendous undercurrents.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi> We might look at the history on this. <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> decided post-Afghanistan on a
                        tightening of the controls. We have been attempting to tighten the controls
                        for the last year, but there are two problems. One was the lack of a
                        coherent U.S. policy. The second is the reluctance of our Allies. It will be
                        a strong, uphill battle to strengthen controls (even going for Option II),
                        but it can be accomplished by strong leadership. We would all like Option
                        III, but we can’t do it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName>:</hi> But they still want to buy them from the U.S.
                        Allowing them to have the pipelayers helps them (to solve their

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName>:</hi> I
                        suggest we go through the same routine on the remaining papers. The
                        remaining three papers examine the U.S. and Allied positions on the export
                        of equipment and technology that would assist the Soviets in the exploration
                        and production of oil and gas.</p>
                    <p>However, they do not pose the question of whether it is in the interest of
                        the U.S. and the Western Allies to assist development of Soviet energy? The
                        major arguments on this question are:</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">For:</hi>
               </p>
                    <p>—Developing Soviet energy helps them overcome potential energy and hard
                        currency shortages and reduces their motivation to aggression in the Persian
                        Gulf Oil area.</p>
                    <p>—Increases the world oil supply and keeps the Soviets from purchasing on
                        Western oil markets, reducing pressure on world oil prices.</p>
                    <p>—Maintains a cooperative relationship with the Soviet Union in an important
                        economic area to offset the competitive relationship in the military
                        sectors.</p>
                    <p>—Results in substantial export and employment benefits for U.S. and Allied
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Against:</hi>
               </p>
                    <p>—It is unlikely that the Soviet Union will ever become dependent on the world
                        market for oil imports; if it decides to intervene in the Persian Gulf, it
                        will do so for reasons other than to obtain oil; e.g., to deprive the West
                        of oil.</p>
                    <p>—Western equipment and technology reduces the costs of energy development to
                        the Soviet Union and frees resources for application in the military
                        sector.</p>
                    <pb n="197" facs="0228" xml:id="pg_197"/>
                    <p>—Western assistance contributes to an expansion of Soviet energy exports to
                        the West and to Eastern Europe and increases their dependence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—It is inconsistent to seek increases in defense expenditures while making it
                        easier for the Soviets to devote resources to their military.</p>
                    <p>These are some of the very complex issues. Al, would you like to begin the
                        discussion?</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi> There are five options to consider (referring to
                        Oil/Gas Controls). The first three are so restrictive we cannot get Allied
                        cooperation on them. The Allies would argue that these options would result
                        in greater Soviet demand on the world oil market and lead to more aggressive
                        Soviet behavior. This is a complex issue. The toughest to be decided today.
                        It involves—is it in our interest to hinder Soviet energy development? What
                        are the implications of decreased Soviet production? What can be negotiated
                        with our Allies? The Allies will perceive us as rigid. The Soviets will
                        appear to be forthcoming. We give them no incentive to negotiate with us.
                        The question is do we wish to concentrate on limiting exports of technology,
                        or on end use equipment that is available elsewhere?</p>
                    <p>We should focus on preventing access to technology—Option IV—but with a
                        case-by-case analysis of end items. But as an overall policy, we should go
                        for controls on export of technology.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName>:</hi>
                        That covers the second paper, but are you prepared to state your position on
                        the pipeline?</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi> Yes, if you want me to. The first two options are
                        overly harsh and not sustainable. Our Allies see Soviet energy as more
                        secure than <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss>. They want to diversify
                        by taking in Soviet energy.</p>
                    <p>I am concerned about the dependency question. I would recommend a modified
                        Option III, where we would look at end items before licensing. We can put
                        major pressure on our Allies at the Summit, but I have talked to Schmidt
                        twice and to <persName corresp="#p_GHD_1">Genscher</persName> three times on
                        the pipeline and they refuse to give up on it and, Mr. President, you
                        received a call from Schmidt over the weekend. They say they can go for six
                        months in the event of a Soviet cut-off. I favor Option III, very much
                        toughened on any item.</p>
                    <p>On the pipelayers, the Japanese are going to sell them anyway. The Soviets
                        have approximately 1,500 of them in inventory. These are replacements for
                        existing equipment. They are not for the Siberian Pipeline. They involve no
                        sophisticated technology. They are not <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> controlled. They can be used only for pipelaying. They
                        have no other applications. They do not involve a technology transfer. The
                        Japanese would provide them.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>:</hi> I feel differently on all three issues.
                        I haven’t all the Schmidt arguments, but I am weary of defining our policy
                        on <pb n="198" facs="0229" xml:id="pg_198"/>what Schmidt wants. Our policy
                        should be leadership—not anticipating what our Allies will say and setting
                        our policy on that. The Schmidt government is weak and may not be around
                        long, anyway.</p>
                    <p>It should be clear to our Allies that it is definitely against our (mutual)
                        interests to increase Soviet capabilities by $20 billion per year.</p>
                    <p>We sent scrap iron to Japan before World War II and we are doing a great deal
                        to increase Soviet capabilities. We need a harder line position.</p>
                    <p>We should come closer to Option I on Oil/Gas Export Controls. We need to
                        demonstrate to our Allies that it is not in our interest to increase Soviet
                        capabilities. It will take hard work to develop energy substitutes
                        (alternative supplies for them).</p>
                    <p>The easy way to go is to give up. The Soviet ability to build the pipeline
                        without Western assistance is questionable. Compressors are necessary to the
                        pipeline. We can work with our competitors to develop internal arrangements
                        to make the Japanese less willing to sell.</p>
                    <p>Komatsu gets a subsidy from the Japanese government. The Japanese can
                        subsidize because they don’t have to pay for their own defense. We need to
                        persuade the Allies with alternative solutions (to their energy needs) that
                        the pipeline is not in their interest. For example, Komatsu wants into the
                        U.S. market.</p>
                    <p>I would take a position much closer to our security interests. It seems wrong
                        to authorize equipment they want from us. On the Caterpillar pipelayers, I
                        would elect Option I (deny). On the Siberian Pipeline, somewhere between
                        Options I and II. It is not in our interest to increase Allied
                        dependence.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Vice President:</hi> Suppose Caterpillar has a French
                        facility, would U.S. restrictions apply?</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>:</hi> Yes, we can enforce U.S. law on a U.S.
                        company. We can persuade them under U.S. law.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Vice President:</hi> Suppose the company is 51 percent
                        foreign owned?</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>:</hi> There are means by which we can control
                        the exports.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName>:</hi> We want to be as tough as we can, operating
                        in the real world. If we go too far and can’t get our Allies to go with us,
                        it won’t work. I have with me Assistant Secretary Larry Brady, who is known
                        as “the toughest gun in the West” on export controls and he supports this
                        position. The products—pipelayers, compressors, drill bits—are generally
                        available from other sources.</p>
                    <p>As Al said, there are 1,400 pipelayers in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Komatsu is 1/3 the size of Caterpillar and has the market
                        targeted. We cannot stop all these countries from shipping to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>My position is Option IV on Oil/Gas Controls, Option III on the pipeline
                        project.</p>
                    <p>The pipelayers get to be an emotional argument. The Japanese will sell them
                        to the Soviets. The existing licensing requirements were imposed for human
                        rights reasons.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DWK_1">Davis</persName>:</hi> The theme of the discussion seems to be what
                        our Allies will support. We want to restrict export of technology, but this
                        requires Allied support. The international oil companies are the transferors
                        of technology. To control them would require strong Allied support.</p>
                    <p>My main concern is the Siberian Pipeline. It will have an important effect on
                        Soviet exports. I would like to delay or restrict it.</p>
                    <p>On the Oil/Gas Controls, I would prefer Option III, if strongly supported by
                        our Allies; Option IV if we do not get that support. On the pipeline, I
                        prefer Option II, but Option III is more likely practical. The pipelayers
                        should not be supplied, but our decision should depend on the Japanese
                        position.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWE_1">Brock</persName>:</hi> I would recommend Option IV on Oil/Gas; Option
                        III on the pipeline, and Option III on the pipelayers.</p>
                    <p>There are strong feelings in this room on what should be done. However, I
                        believe there are two threats to our security. There is the Soviet threat
                        and the economic threat.</p>
                    <p>Increased oil prices have put heavy economic burdens on the Free World. The
                        fact that Schmidt is in trouble and that there are four communists in the
                        French government illustrates the economic weakness. Our Allies are all in
                        political jeopardy, including Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_TM_1">Thatcher</persName>. We give far more than $20 billion annually to the
                            <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> countries. A way to break <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> would be desirable. But we are not
                        working on it. To break a potential dependency on the Soviets, we need to
                        increase exports of coal, nuclear, etc.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Regan</persName>:</hi> We want the Soviets to keep producing oil and
                        gas. We could not supply Europe. We are probably going to have a shortage of
                        gas in the mid-80s. Now Western Europe is hostage to Algeria. Their
                        economies are weakened by energy events. It is advisable to keep the gas
                        flowing.</p>
                    <p>My recommendations are: Oil/Gas—Option IV; Siberian Pipeline—Option III;

                        increasing their hard currency by 25 percent. The Soviets are a small factor
                        in the Allies’ trade accounts. We are a larger factor.</p>

                    <p>The Soviets cannot do without gas. They will have to divert resources to

                        opposing the pipeline. We have the right to tell our Allies they should not

                        Option II; on the pipeline, Option I or II; and on the pipelayers, Option
                        I.</p>
                    <p>But we cannot restrict everything if the Allies let it flow. We should not
                        take unilateral action. Should have some flexibility in getting our Allies
                        cooperation.</p>

                        have grave doubts about frustrating Soviet production of energy for three
                        reasons:</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>1. There is an asymmetry in oil resources versus would populations,
                            with reserves concentrated in the Middle East and in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Restrictions on Soviet production
                            would impose a burden on the West, which needs energy.</p>
                        <p>2. The Soviet Bloc is now a large net exporter. If we impede them, we
                            will reduce their exportable surplus. This would cost them foreign
                            exchange, but would increase Western energy prices.</p>
                        <p>3. There is a good case for exceptionalism (to other restrictive
                            policies) in Oil/Gas. Exports of Oil/Gas equipment come back to the West
                            in the form of Oil and Gas, improving the energy balance and decreasing
                            world prices.</p>
               </quote>
                    <p>I favor the same options as Treasury.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KJJ_1">Kirkpatrick</persName>:</hi> We consistently find that, in our
                        negotiations, the Allies are already significantly dependent. France for 15
                        percent of its gas; the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> for 30 percent.
                        Our negotiations and discussions with our Allies already mention dependency
                        as an inhibiting factor on their actions.</p>
                    <p>Increases in energy supplies won’t necessarily hold down Soviet prices. They
                        don’t necessarily price on a supply-demand basis. We have to think about
                        Option I on each of the three issues.</p>

                        requirement for decisions. Because of the size of the Pipeline project and
                        its strategic implications, it is the most urgent and important
                        decision.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi> Much of what has been said about the pipeline is
                        theology. It always is. But we have to go to Ottawa with a strong
                        alternative program. We have to have a strong, skeptical view. We should not
                        support the pipeline. We should stay skeptical and work with our Allies.</p>

                        rigid (in our approach) to maintain a stricter position. Our Allies note
                        they have the Soviets next to them. Trade is more essential to them. But,
                        how do we say to our own people that we must continue to sacrifice—and to
                        our Allies—if we are not prepared to use all our weapons? Don’t we seem
                        guilty of hyprocrisy—weak—if we are not prepared to take a strong

                    </list>
                    <p>When <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> saw me on July 2 he
                        brought in a paper on U.S.-Chinese relations, following up the earlier
                        approach he had made to <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Walter
                            Stoessel</persName> on June 17.<note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">See <ref target="#d63">Document 63</ref>.</note> Both papers were worded
                        fairly sharply, but this new one drops the subject of “assurances” which
                        previous Administrations had supposedly given the Soviets about not arming
                        the Chinese. Nor does the new one repeat the threat that they would consider
                        our arming the Chinese hostile to the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The new demarche is not, in fact, limited to the question of arms supply but
                        treats our relationship with the Chinese more broadly, claiming that we are
                        guided in developing that relationship solely by hostility toward the Soviet
                        Union. The main point seems to be a warning <pb n="202" facs="0233" xml:id="pg_202"/>that we should realize that there is a limit as to how
                        far we can go in developing relations with China without affecting the very
                        nature of our relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>While the June 17 demarche thus appears to have been a quick reaction to the
                        first sensational press reports about our new attitude toward possible arms
                        transfers to China, this second demarche, like some of the more recent
                        Soviet propaganda statements, seems to reflect a more realistic appreciation
                        of the situation. In effect, the message seems to be that the Soviets are
                        waiting to see what we actually do about arms transfers before drawing any
                        firm conclusions. The paper ends with an expression of hope that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, and you personally, will take a fresh
                        look at our recent steps toward China and weigh “the real costs and
                        dangers.”</p>

                    <p>The Soviet leadership deems it necessary to touch once again upon the
                        question of US intentions and actions in the field of its relations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. It appears that the American side
                        has been increasingly guided in that field not by the interests of
                        international peace and stability or even by the logic and dynamics of
                        developing normal relationship between the two States, but exclusively by
                        considerations hostile to the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Do not, for example, statements pertaining to agreement reached between the
                            <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, on coordinating their efforts in order <pb n="203" facs="0234" xml:id="pg_203"/>to “limit the Soviet Union’s
                        opportunities”, to co-operate “on a new plateau”, and to expand military
                        ties between them testify to it?</p>
                    <p>Moreover, the American side openly declared that it was including China from
                        now on into the category of states friendly to the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> while proclaiming its intent to deal with the Soviet Union
                        proceeding from a hostile nature of relations with it. A question is in
                        order—how would the US leadership perceive and qualify declarations of that
                        kind if the United States were in the place of the Soviet Union?</p>
                    <p>And the matter is not confined to declarations alone. Now on the agenda are
                        already sales of American weapons and military equipment to China. The
                        obvious intent of this decision cannot be disguised or changed by attempts
                        of the American side to present the aforesaid decision as if it were a
                        routine step within the framework of a regular development of Sino-American
                        relations which allegedly does not infringe upon the interests of other
                        states or endanger world peace.</p>
                    <p>But is it possible to consider it a routine matter to transfer lethal weapons
                        to a country whose leaders openly advocate the inevitability of a new world
                        war and in fact push others toward unleashing it? And is it possible to
                        consider it normal to assist militarily a country which puts groundless
                        territorial claims practically to all of its neighbors and wages armed
                        attacks and incursions on their territories?</p>
                    <p>The Government of the US ought to know all this. Nevertheless, it invites
                        Peking to address to it its requests for arms deliveries. The American side
                        is obviously far from being disturbed by the flippant way in which Peking is
                        prepared to play with the destiny of the world and to recourse to the
                        military force.</p>
                    <p>We have already warned the American side of the dangerous consequences that
                        the policy of encouraging the expansionist aspirations of China might have
                        for peace and stability in the Far East and South-East Asia. And it would
                        seem that the leadership of the United States should realize that there is a
                        line in Soviet-American relations in connection with China, crossing which
                        will inevitably affect the very nature of these relations, and to the
                        detriment of not only the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Reaffirming all that we have said previously in connection with the
                        intentions of the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> to provide China with
                        weapons and military technology, we would like to say quite clearly that
                        whatever the American side is guided by in this matter, it should not
                        deceive itself as to the capability of the Soviet Union to prevent any harm
                        to its security or security of its allies and friends.</p>
                    <p>The American side should also be aware that any of its practical steps aimed
                        at strengthening China militarily in circumstances when the latter takes an
                        openly hostile stand against the Soviet Union, will be properly taken into
                        account by us.</p>
                    <pb n="204" facs="0235" xml:id="pg_204"/>
                    <p>The Soviet leadership while frankly stating its views on the matter, would
                        like to express its hope that the US Government and the President personally
                        will once again thoroughly weigh all of their latest steps regarding China,
                        and match them against the real costs and dangers they present to the world
                        and not in the least to the US itself.</p>

                                <ref target="#d67">Document 67</ref>.</note> I wanted you to be
                        aware of my deep concerns on the subject. Your decisions will have a
                        profound effect on our Alliances and our relations with the Soviets for
                        years to come. For that reason I want to convey an approach which in my
                        judgment meets your desire for a <hi rend="italic">consistent</hi> policy
                        which weakens the Soviets’ military capability without weakening our
                        Alliance.</p>
                    <p>Like you I believe Western assistance to the Soviet energy sector in many
                        respects runs contrary to our security interests. It relieves the Soviets of
                        an important resource burden; it can provide them with equipment and
                        technology with potential military applications; it may increase their
                        leverage over our Allies; and the pipeline particularly would provide them
                        with large sums of hard currency. If I had my preference, I would take an
                        extremely restrictive approach to trade with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>However, for any controls to work we need the cooperation of our Allies. For
                        us to attempt to get straight across-the-board restrictions, which some of
                        the more restrictive alternatives before you imply, or to press the
                        Europeans with an approach which they will find completely unacceptable, and
                        threaten to withhold licenses unless they comply, would make it virtually
                        impossible to get their support for a reasonable set of controls. By
                        pursuing our maximum objectives, we run the risk <pb n="205" facs="0236" xml:id="pg_205"/>of coming away with very little, severely weakening the
                        Alliance and isolating us from our Allies.</p>
                    <p>Our European Allies have legitimate and urgent interests in seeking
                        additional and diversified sources of energy, and the decision, in the end,
                        is theirs. Therefore, we must consider that we can realistically expect to
                        achieve in limiting their involvement with the Soviet energy sector and at
                        what cost. The cost that concerns me most is not lost business opportunities
                        but rather the prospects of divisions within the Alliance. An overly rigid
                        position could produce a confrontation with our Allies that would not only
                        fail to produce any restraint on Soviet energy sales but would itself be an
                        enormous positive gain for the Russians. We do not want to repeat, on a
                        larger scale, the <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>
                        Administration’s disastrous confrontation with the Germans over the sale of
                        German nuclear technology to Brazil.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, my own position is shaped by weighing what I would like to achieve
                        against what I believe we can actually accomplish. I think that one of our
                        most important objectives is tightening up on technology transfers,
                        including <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> controls. The past record
                        suggests that this task alone will be very difficult to accomplish. I
                        therefore do not believe that we should be taking categorical negative
                        positions on the sale of end-use equipment or striking a categorical
                        opposition to the pipeline.<note n="3" xml:id="d70fn3">An unknown hand
                            underlined: “striking a categorical opposition to pipeline.”</note>
               </p>
                    <p>Whatever position you ultimately decide on, Mr. President, it is equally
                        important to stipulate appropriate tactics and style with which to approach
                        our Allies. We must, above all, not adopt a confrontational posture or an
                        inflexible position. We must recognize that they have much more serious
                        energy problems than we do, and that the sacrifices we are proposing would
                        be borne much more heavily by them than by us.</p>
                    <p>If we are to have any chance of persuading them to modify their current
                        positions (or at the very least to scale down the size of their proposed
                        dependence on Soviet energy) we must take a stronger lead in evolving a
                        better Energy Cooperation Package. This will require that the United States
                        play a much more practical role than we have in the past in boosting Alaskan
                        oil exports, increasing the pace of U.S. natural gas deregulation,
                        increasing U.S. coal exports, providing a coal gasification program,
                        addressing the major problem of nuclear wastes, pressing Holland and Norway
                        to develop natural gas surge capacity and developing new initiatives. This
                        may even involve increased resource commitments on our part. But if we
                        expect our Allies to bear a burden we <pb n="206" facs="0237" xml:id="pg_206"/>must be prepared to do so ourselves in the general
                        interest of Western security. There is no free lunch.</p>
                    <p>The development of alternative energy sources is something which we should
                        pursue urgently, whatever we do on the subject of Soviet energy
                        development.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Security related export controls</hi>—I continue to
                        believe that restricting technology and equipment critical to defense
                        priority industries which would significantly advance Soviet military
                        capability would be a major step forward in <hi rend="italic">weakening the

                        support to the Soviet military. To ensure that this option (#2) is pursued
                        in a way which meets <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Cap Weinberger</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Mac Baldrige</persName>’s concerns, I
                        propose to get together with them to flesh out the details of implementation
                        and to prepare a strong presentation for you to take to Ottawa in support of
                        this approach. The past record suggests that securing allied support for
                        this approach will be very difficult—but in my judgment it should be our
                        major objective.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Oil and gas equipment and technology</hi>—The central
                        issue is whether to direct our ammunition at restricting technology <hi rend="italic">or</hi> to attempt to restrict technology plus all end-use
                        equipment (e.g. pipes and pipelayers). Allied support for restricted end-use
                        equipment will be visibly impossible to obtain. If we press for it we will
                        jeopardize our chances of their agreeing to restrict technology exports. A
                        unified set of allied restrictions on technology which would give the
                        Soviets an independent capability to improve oil and gas useage and
                        infrastructure would be a major step forward. End-use products could be
                        denied on a case by case basis as foreign policy concerns warrant. I
                        genuinely believe that this flexibility in your hands can be extremely
                        important in the pursuit of your foreign policy objective vis-a-vis the
                        Soviet Union and our allies. And, adoption of this course of action—as
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Don Regan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SD_1">Dave Stockman</persName> noted—will contribute to
                        keeping the Soviets off the world energy market and reduce any incentive
                        which future domes<pb n="207" facs="0238" xml:id="pg_207"/>tic energy
                        shortages might provide for adventurism in the Middle East or other energy

                        <hi rend="italic">The Siberian Gas Pipeline</hi>—I would like to find a way
                        of <hi rend="italic">convincing</hi> the Europeans not to build the

                        to be counterproductive. An approach which would lead Europe not to build
                        the pipeline or perhaps encourage them to scale down its size, would be for
                        the US, Europe and Japan to work out a strong <hi rend="italic">Energy
                            Cooperation Package</hi>. This would involve US Alaskan oil exports,
                        faster US natural gas deregulation, increased US coal exports, and increased
                        nuclear cooperation, a strong commitment to deal with oil shortfalls in the
                        context of the International Energy Agency, plus additional efforts by
                        Holland and Norway to develop surge capacity. Even if this approach failed
                        to deter the Europeans from going ahead with, or scale down, the pipeline,
                        it would substantially reduce their vulnerability to Soviet cut-offs if the
                        pipeline were built and reduce levels of gas through the pipeline.</p>

                    <p>An exchange of pleasantries followed.</p>

                        President, we have a full agenda today. If you will permit me, I would like
                        to state the objective of today’s meeting and then a suggested method of
                        procedure.</p>
                    <p>We have two topics to cover. We will continue our discussion of East-West
                        controls. We would also like to devote some attention to the <pb n="209" facs="0240" xml:id="pg_209"/>Caribbean Basin Policy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWE_1">Brock</persName> will be going to Nassau this weekend
                        for a Foreign Minister’s meeting.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the East-West portion of our discussion, we have only a short
                        period to make decisions required to be presented to our Allies at the
                        Ottawa Summit meeting. We need, at that meeting, to seek their support for
                        important initiatives that will have a profound effect on both near- and
                        longer-term military, political and economic facets of our East-West
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>Our objective today is to complete the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                        discussion of the East-West trade topics, though the President may choose
                        not to make his final decisions for a few more days.</p>
                    <p>There is a great deal of complex material to be covered and each agency
                        should have an opportunity to advance its key arguments. Therefore, I
                        propose to proceed as follows:</p>
                    <p>There appear to be substantial areas of agreement on the Allied Security
                        Controls topic. While there is not unanimity on the precise course to be
                        followed, I believe the positions of individual departments are quite well
                        defined. Perhaps some adjustments could be made to narrow if we spent more
                        time. However, I believe it would be better to spend the major portion of
                        time on those key issues where wider divergencies exist; that is, on the
                        Oil/Gas and Siberian Pipeline issues. Additionally, we have three new
                            papers<note n="2" xml:id="d71fn2">

                            entitled “A Positive Approach: The Siberian Pipeline and West European

                    <p>Therefore, Mr. President, unless you wish to propose some questions on the
                        Allied Security Controls, I suggest we move on to the Oil/Gas and Siberian

                        on an <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> memo request to Secretaries
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>, they have made two additional
                        submissions, answering certain questions. These two additional submissions
                        have been provided to all the participants here. Additionally, today I sent
                        them two further questions based on their submissions. If you will forgive
                        the somewhat rigid nature of this procedure, I will now pose to them the two
                        questions they were provided earlier and they could then answer these
                        questions.</p>
                    <pb n="210" facs="0241" xml:id="pg_210"/>
                    <p>Following that we could then go around the table for additional comments and
                        questions. Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> and

                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>, your July 8 paper
                        proposes a “very tough Option III” under which we would “press” our Allies
                        to take several specific measures to minimize their dependency on Soviet
                        gas. If we do not ourselves deny licenses on exports related to the project,
                        and if we do not enlist the aid of the Japanese and British in restricting
                        exports critical to the project, what is it that is “tough” about our
                        policy? Also, what kind of pressure would we put on our Allies to get them
                        to give anything more than lip service to the program of minimizing
                        dependence you have outlined?</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi> We should be clear on the two questions. You have
                        singled out the pipeline. The other issue is Oil/Gas Controls. On that issue
                        we don’t believe we could get Allied cooperation on controls on technology
                            <hi rend="italic">and</hi> equipment. We want to control the technology,
                        but don’t believe we can do the equipment as well.</p>
                    <p>Related to the original question, “Where are we on the pipeline?” Gentlemen,
                        we have been talking about “jawboning”—that’s what it is. And we have been
                        doing it. We have talked with <persName corresp="#p_GHD_1">Genscher</persName>. We have talked with Schmidt. They want the
                        pipeline! It is important to them! If we ask them to stop, we are asking
                        them to sacrifice from a goal of diversifying their energy supply and on
                        trade at the same time. We lifted the controls on three-fourths of our own
                        trade with the Soviets when we lifted the grain embargo. It would be
                        inconsistent to put pressure on them when we are loosening our own
                        controls.</p>
                    <p>We have been trying to get them to stop the pipeline, but cannot get them to
                        do it. Schmidt has committed himself publicly to this transaction. Public
                        arm-twisting by us would be counter-productive. However, I believe
                        intelligent handling can convince them to decrease their vulnerability and
                        to increase their protective measures.</p>
                    <p>Now, as far as a “tough” Option III is concerned, “tough” may be a misnomer.
                        We need to be tough vis-a-vis the Soviets. We need to be tough on our
                        budgeteers; we need to be tough on our Allies. We need to be tough on
                        getting a program to put in place on energy security. We need to press our
                        Allies to cut in half the size of the pipeline deliveries. We need to assist
                        them to diversify—to limit their imports of Soviet gas.</p>

                    <p>In recent weeks the increase in interest rates, the decrease in the projected
                        demand for gas, etc., has been causing consumption problems and a glut in
                        oil.</p>
                    <p>We should be prepared to give our Allies an alternative package that would
                        involve, perhaps, Alaskan oil. We should deregulate natural gas, make
                        provisions to deepen our harbors to expand coal shipments. This may require
                        some Federal financing. We should reinforce and increase energy sharing
                        arrangements. We must do this <hi rend="italic">whether or not</hi> the
                        pipeline is built. We had to help the Dutch in the last oil crisis.</p>
                    <p>I think, Mr. President, you should mobilize at the Summit a high-level
                        monitoring group.</p>
                    <p>(The following question was posed in writing to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> before the meeting. He answered
                        without the question being reposed.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName>’s question submitted
                        earlier in writing follows:</p>
                    <p>Would it be inconsistent with your scenario to press very strongly at Ottawa,
                        especially on the Germans and French, perhaps privately, for their agreement
                        to delay further negotiations on the pipeline for, say six months, pending a
                        thorough inter-Allied review of the project and alternatives to it?</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi> With regard to the second question, “Would we ask
                        them to delay six months?” We shouldn’t do this. If we start the work to
                        demonstrate there are other alternatives, they don’t want to spend their
                        money there (on the pipeline). But the pipeline is a public problem for
                        Schmidt. He is publicly committed to it. They will tread water anyway,
                        without our requiring them to do so.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, you will find at Ottawa that our European Allies are in a blue
                        funk about their economic situation. They blame us in part for their
                        problems, because of our approach to our own economic problems—because of
                        our interest rates. A rigid approach to this problem of the pipeline will
                        bring a repeat of the disastrous <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> Administration confrontation with the Germans over
                        the sale of German nuclear technology to Brazil—with a far more significant
                        effect on our ability to deal on East-West matters!</p>

                  <p>Your objective, as stated in your paper, is to stop the pipeline or,

                            six months, until a full examination of all aspects of the project can

                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>:</hi> We are unequivocally in favor of
                        stopping the pipeline. Leadership does not add up the columns on the
                        opinions of our Allies, then conclude you are defeated. You decide what is
                        needed and you do it. The Europeans should be clear on that.</p>
                    <p>I suspect that the speculation re a shaky economic base for the pipeline is
                        true. We should drive home that we are unalterably opposed to it.</p>
                    <p>Nobody here at this table wants it built. We can do all the things listed
                        that have been talked about to provide alternatives to the Europeans. They
                        are all good. We can do all the substitutes. But why do all that and build
                        the pipeline too?</p>
                    <p>We have the objective of stopping it. That may be impossible, but we must
                        try. If built, it will produce large hard currency earnings for the Soviet
                        Union. It will increase European dependence on the Soviets. We worry, even
                        now, about the course of the Germans.</p>
                    <p>Realistically, we have persuasive power. We must exercise it. Otherwise, to
                        offer these alternatives is useless. If the pipeline is built, we have lost.
                        We give the impression of a weak, undecided country. We must use all
                        reasonable leadership and tactics and alternatives.</p>
                    <p>If someone believes we can use delay as a means—fine, but our objective
                        should be to stop the pipeline. We need to be firm, resolute, in our
                        objective to stop it. We must use all the proper tactics and strategy.</p>

                        second question is: “As you indicated, compressors that must come from
                        either the U.S. or the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> are critical to
                        the pipeline. However, these compressors offer potential sales of as much as
                        $300–$600 million to Rolls Royce, a sick company in a sick British economy
                        with a current unemployment rate of about ten percent. Faced with high
                        levels of unemployment and with a German and French desire to go ahead with
                        the pipeline, what incentive would there be for the British government to
                        block the sale of these compressors? What pressures or incentives could we
                        bring to bear to motivate the British to go along with our desire to block
                        the pipeline? Wouldn’t British cooperation be significantly easier to obtain
                        if our <hi rend="italic">stated</hi> objective was only to <hi rend="italic">delay</hi> the pipeline, pending a review of alternatives and/or steps
                        to minimize European dependency, as compared to a position where we propose

                        Yes, Mr. President, I would like to make three points.</p>
                    <p>First, minimizing their dependence (on <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss>
                        oil) would not be achieved by Soviet gas which would provide only three
                        percent of West European energy. More important, this pipeline is the
                        largest East-West deal ever. We have to take this matter very seriously.
                        This is our greatest opportunity ever to force the Soviets to divert
                        resources from military programs.</p>
                    <p>Second, the $16 billion to be lent to the Soviets for this project should
                        better be lent on this side of the curtain to develop Western sources. There
                        are probably better and less expensive alternatives in the West than the
                        pipeline.</p>
                    <p>Third, with regard to the tactics at Ottawa, at a minimum we should put it
                        off until we explore other alternatives that will be permanent assets to the
                        West.</p>

                        to take the strongest possible position. But we are weakened if we fail. We
                        don’t believe it is practical to stop compressors and pipelayers and the
                        other equipment needed for the pipeline. There is a cable in today that
                        reports a Japanese sale of 500 pipelayers to the Russians.<note n="5" xml:id="d71fn5">Reference is to telegram 12715 from Tokyo, July 9.

                        the pipeline. Other smaller equipment alternatives are available now from

                        pipeline.</p>
                    <p>The same is true of the compressors. There are two sources now, but others
                        can make compressors in the reasonably near future. In the time needed to
                        get the pipeline going—three to four years—many other alternatives can be
                        developed.</p>

                        develop alternatives. We have said we want financing of dredging of harbors,
                        etc., by the private sector. We want foreign capital to develop our

                        success of doing so.</p>
                    <p>In either event, we need to increase other alternative sources. However, the
                        other alternatives are not necessarily direct substitutes for gas. Nuclear
                        power development takes considerable time. Deregulation of U.S. gas would
                        free supplies for Western Europe. But we need to get going on such
                        programs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWE_1">Brock</persName>:</hi> In the last meeting I spoke about the economic
                        aspects of this issue. Now I want to look at it as a politician. There are
                        desperate economic problems in Europe. There is the effect of high U.S.
                        interest rates, which has resulted in a revaluation of the dollar that has
                        brought to Western Europe the equivalent of a “third oil shock.” Western
                        Europe has a $13 billion trade deficit with us.</p>
                    <p>It is better to go with a request that they delay. I am intrigued with
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWJ_1">Bill Casey</persName>’s suggestion of gas
                        from coal. We have lots of coal here, but we can’t guarantee it will be
                        economic until we cost it out.</p>
                    <p>How we do it (persuade the Allies to stop/delay) is important. I support,

                        subsidizing other sources, we will wind up later with the Soviets having
                        their energy, while we are depleting ours.</p>

                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Al Haig</persName> gives you an analysis of a
                        nonpaper (Tab A) handed him by <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> on July 2.<note n="2" xml:id="d72fn2">Printed as
                                <ref target="#d69">Document 69</ref>.</note> It is the second Soviet
                        demarche in two weeks concerning U.S.-Chinese relations as affected by
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s recent visit to Beijing.
                        Al accurately remarks on the more temperate tone of this new note. It is not
                        certain, however, that he is correct in interpreting the first note as a
                        “quick reaction” and the second as a “more realistic appreciation”. The June
                        17 note was a measured and somber warning that had nothing spontaneous about
                            it.<note n="3" xml:id="d72fn3">See <ref target="#d63">Document
                            63</ref>.</note> The new one has a certain propagandistic element in it.
                        One may argue that the different tone of the two documents reflects
                        confusion in Moscow on how to react to <pb n="219" facs="0250" xml:id="pg_219"/>the U.S. initiatives in the Far East: one time they try
                        threats, the next time they try persuasion. (S)</p>
                    <p>Al’s decision to approach <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        through <persName corresp="#p_MJF_1">Matlock</persName> is sound. The Soviet
                        leadership should be set straight on the reasons for and implications of our
                        relationship with Beijing: the ball should be tossed into their court.

                    <p>Begin text</p>
                    <p>July 10, 1981</p>
                    <p>Dear Mr. Minister:</p>
                    <p>I am using the opportunity of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s return to Moscow to convey some initial thoughts
                        on our forthcoming meeting in New York. I can assure you that we attach the
                        highest importance to this meeting and wish to ensure a positive and
                        productive outcome.</p>
                    <p>As President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> has made clear in
                        his communications with President <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>, we want to establish a constructive and stable
                        relationship with the Soviet Union. There is much we can and must do
                        together to build a more peaceful world. Accepting that we will continue to
                        compete, we also must recognize that unrestrained competition could lead to
                        catastrophe.</p>
                    <p>Therefore I believe the fundamental purpose of our meeting in New York should
                        be to reach a better understanding about the kind of restraint needed to
                        prevent future crisis. We also should launch a process designed to resolve
                        the specific current problems between us. <pb n="220" facs="0251" xml:id="pg_220"/>Concrete, substantive resolution of these issues would
                        go far toward laying a new and durable foundation for our relationship.</p>
                    <p>The most significant of these issues remains the question of Afghanistan. I
                        feel it is important that we have a serious, non-polemical discussion. Our
                        interest is to find a solution. Movement toward a political solution in
                        Afghanistan could make a significant difference in our overall
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p>I also want to explore with you how we might make progress on Kampuchea.</p>
                    <p>A broader question, one which has repeatedly raised regional and
                        international tensions over the past decade, is that of Cuban adventurism in
                        the developing world.</p>
                    <p>I will be prepared to discuss other questions involving critical countries
                        and regions, and the need for each of us to make positive efforts. I do not
                        expect that we will be able to reach definitive solutions during our
                        meeting. But recognizing the fundamental and growing problem geopolitical
                        issues have presented for the US-Soviet relationship for several decades, it
                        is imperative that we achieve a better general understanding about the need
                        for restraint. I believe we can make progress if both sides approach the
                        meeting with a determination to avoid polemics and begin defining realistic
                        solutions.</p>
                    <p>I propose that we make the question of negotiations on limiting long range
                        theater nuclear forces the other main topic on our agenda.</p>
                    <p>I have conveyed through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> our desire to begin negotiations before the end of
                        the year.</p>
                    <p>Our goal in these negotiations is to reach agreement on equitable and
                        verifiable limitations on the systems of both sides. Our objective is not
                        superiority, but we cannot accept an outcome which perpetuates the existing
                        imbalance. We are under no illusion that this will be an easy or simple
                        negotiation. But we intend to spare no effort to bring about an agreement
                        that enhances stability.</p>
                    <p>I look forward to discussing these issues with you further in New York. As
                        you know, we have already begun concrete discussions with your Embassy here
                        to lay the groundwork for our discussions. These will be continuing in the
                        weeks ahead. We would hope that these preparatory talks will enable us to
                        reach agreement in New York on detailed arrangements for the opening of
                        negotiations before the end of this year. If so, I would propose that our
                        agreement be reflected in a joint statement at the conclusion of our
                        talks.</p>
                    <p>There are other areas of our relationship which can provide mutually
                        advantageous opportunities for cooperation and understanding. In this
                        regard, I will be prepared to review our continuing activities under the
                        U.S.-Soviet exchange agreements and future prospects for <pb n="221" facs="0252" xml:id="pg_221"/>such activities. I will also be prepared to
                        describe in general terms our approach to East-West trade matters, and our
                        views on the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> process, in addition to
                        the question of long range theater nuclear forces.</p>
                    <p>The agenda I have outlined above is an ambitious one. I would welcome your
                        ideas on what might be discussed between us, as well as how we might best
                        approach the issues either one of us would like to raise. I would propose,
                        as well, that our meeting there involve two sessions, separated perhaps by
                        two or three days. This would enable us to reflect on our initial talks and,
                        if necessary, consult with our governments before continuing the
                        discussions.</p>
                    <p>As I noted earlier, Mr. Minister, I look forward to our meeting as an
                        important opportunity to deepen and expand the dialogue we have begun over
                        the past six months. For our part, we will be prepared to do what we can to
                        ensure a productive outcome. Sincerely, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Alexander M. Haig, Jr.</persName> End text</p>

                        <salute>Dear Mr. Secretary,</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I gave careful attention to your letter of July 10, 1981.<note n="2" xml:id="d74fn2">See <ref target="#d73">Document 73</ref>.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>First of all I would like to confirm that I accept your proposal regarding
                        our meeting in New York in the initial period of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly session. I also agree that in that period
                        we have not one, but two sessions with several days interval.</p>
                    <p>We take note that you attach the highest importance to the forthcoming
                        meeting and wish to insure its positive and productive outcome. I can
                        definitely say that it meets our intentions too.</p>
                    <p>Since that is the case and taking into account the fact that our first
                        meeting with you will take place in the conditions of deteriorated <pb n="222" facs="0253" xml:id="pg_222"/>international situation, in my view
                        it would be right and natural to concentrate our attention on major issues
                        on whose solution both the state of Soviet-American relations and the
                        situation in the world as a whole depend.</p>
                    <p>In this connection I would like to recall what <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">L.I. Brezhnev</persName> wrote to President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">R. Reagan</persName>: “We do not seek confrontation
                        with the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>, we do not encroach upon
                        legitimate interests of America, we want peace, cooperation, a feeling of
                        mutual trust and goodwill between the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        and the USA”.</p>
                    <p>This naturally presupposes that a similar approach is displayed on the US
                        side as well. Otherwise the tensions in relations between our countries with
                        all ensuing consequences will inevitably continue.</p>
                    <p>Guided by the desire to reverse the present dangerous tendency in world
                        affairs, we propose to the US side to seek mutually acceptable solutions on
                        a wide range of issues of common interest to the Soviet Union and the
                        USA.</p>
                    <p>It would be, however, not a mere delusion but a serious mistake to believe
                        that the Soviet side is more interested in the dialogue than the US and that
                        by giving consent to the dialogue the US side nearly condescends to us. We
                        are convinced that the United States of America, the American people
                        objectively are no less interested than the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, the Soviet people in consideration and resolution of
                        truly pressing problems, above all the problem of curbing the arms race, and
                        lessening the danger of war.</p>
                    <p>That is why one cannot but express puzzlement over the fact that in your
                        letter the problem of strategic arms limitation is mentioned only in
                        passing, and not as a task of paramount importance which has a direct
                        bearing on the destinies of our and not only our peoples.</p>
                    <p>What can be said in this regard? Certainly nobody will force the US
                        administration, if it does not want it, to sit at the negotiating table to
                        discuss this problem. But acting in this manner it should clearly realize
                        that it takes on itself all the responsibility for the fact that it looks as
                        if through its fingers at this cardinal problem now facing the mankind.
                        Incidentally it relates also to many other important problems of arms
                        limitation and disarmament which are not even mentioned in your letter and
                        which it seems are not in the priorities of the US foreign policy at
                        all.</p>
                    <p>At our meeting in New York we will of course be prepared to discuss the
                        questions pertaining to the nuclear arms limitation in Europe, having in
                        mind that under consideration will be the entire complex of medium range
                        nuclear means including the relevant US forward based means as well as
                        medium range nuclear means of the US <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        allies. Only such an approach will be in keeping with the <pb n="223" facs="0254" xml:id="pg_223"/>principle of equality and equal security of
                        the sides. The starting point for discussing all these questions should be
                        the objective fact of the now existing rough parity in the respective means
                        between <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> countries and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. We are ready to seek, without altering
                        this rough parity, to gradually reduce at the same time the level of
                        armaments.</p>
                    <p>In your letter, Mr. Secretary, you stress the necessity to exercise
                        “restraint” in international affairs. But frankly speaking this appeal to
                        “restraint” that you make sounds unconvincingly against the background of
                        what the USA itself does in the full view of the whole world: among other
                        things, an unprecedented rise of military expenditure, programs for creating
                        new destructive weapon systems, search for new military bases and
                        strongholds all over the world, setting up forces specifically intended to
                        interfere into the internal affairs of other states.</p>
                    <p>Hardly be called “restraint”, for example, is what the USA is doing now in
                        the Indian Ocean, in the Persian Gulf, and in the Middle East. Meanwhile all
                        these regions lie much closer to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        than to the USA.</p>
                    <p>And can we consider an exercise of “restraint” on the part of the USA such
                        actions it takes as deliveries of arms to China or plans to redeploy the
                        American troops stationed in the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> closer
                        to the borders of Socialist countries?</p>
                    <p>So as you can see we have enough to say on the subject of “restraint”.</p>
                    <p>We will also be prepared to exchange views on other subjects as well,
                        including among them those which you name—Afghanistan and Kampuchea.
                        Naturally, only the international aspects of these questions can be
                        discussed, that is ways of resolving the situations existing around these
                        states, and by no means their internal affairs.</p>
                    <p>At the same time I want to say at the very outset that we consider
                        unacceptable—both in substance and in form—what is said in your letter with
                        regard to Cuba and its policy.</p>
                    <p>It goes without saying that questions of bilateral relations, among them the
                        state of affairs with the realization of agreements signed earlier between
                        our countries, which you mention in your letter, will also be a subject of
                        our exchange of views.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion I would like to express the hope that given the mutual desire
                        of the sides the forthcoming meeting will permit at least to mark the
                        beginning of a businesslike discussion of problems which indeed await their
                        solution. We are in favour of it.</p>

                    <p>The National Security Planning Group met in the Cabinet Room at the White
                        House July 22, 1981, from 9:39 to 10:14 a.m. (Reagan Library, President’s
                        Daily Diary) No minutes were found. In a July 21 memorandum to President

                        the memorandum, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> initialed his
                        approval of a one-year extension of the grain agreement with the Soviet
                        Union set to expire on September 30, 1981, and his disapproval of guaranteed
                        access independent of Soviet policies toward Afghanistan, Poland, and
                        leftist guerrillas. He did not indicate a decision on whether to increase
                        Soviet purchase limits above a cumulative 8 million tons of wheat and corn.

                        is an undated paper containing four choices on the agreement: (1) “The

                        September 30, 1981, shall be extended for a period of one year”; (2) “While

                        discussions regarding the negotiation of a new five year agreement and an
                        increase in the limits currently in existence, but only in parallel with an

                        guarantees against future embargoes.” Two decisions are also listed with
                        regard to corn sales to Poland. <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> did not indicate a preference among these choices on
                        this memorandum. (Ibid.) However, he wrote in his diary on July 22: “A half
                        day with an N.S.C. meeting on our grain sales to the Soviet. I agreed to a 1
                        yr. extension—our agreement expires Sept. 30. We’ll let them wonder for a

                    <p>—Soviet written response to <persName corresp="#p_CLP_1">Carrington</persName>, rejecting the EC’s Afghanistan initiative should
                        end speculation Moscow might consider it.</p>
                    <p>—U.S. is using Afghanistan as pretext for wrecking principle of equal
                        security at basis of arms control. U.S. is not seriously reviewing <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> conference on Kampuchea is
                        U.S.-engineered and cannot be constructive.</p>
                    <p>—U.S. has no right to call for increased Soviet economic aid to Poland and
                        knows what the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is doing.</p>
                    <p>—Was the U.S., in raising arms supply to Central America, suggesting
                        resumption of the conventional arms transfer talks?</p>
                    <p>—U.S. was going against prior assurances in arming China. What concerns the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is that U.S. considers China a
                        friend and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> an enemy.</p>
                    <p>—He thanked the Charge for the (two hour, bruising) exchange and pronounced
                        it “not unuseful.” End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. Charge began by noting that he had been in Moscow for six months and
                        appreciated the opportunity to speak about some important questions before
                        going to Washington for a week of consultations. He would be meeting with
                        the Secretary and a number of others, and he expected that interest would be
                        on the coming talks between the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. The U.S. had made clear its determination to deal
                        with the consequences of lack of Soviet and proxy restraint but was
                        interested in a stable, durable and mutually satisfactory relationship. We
                        hoped the coming meeting would lay a basis for that. The Charge said he
                        would be happy to convey to the Secretary any thoughts the Soviets had
                        regarding agenda and format of the September meetings.</p>

                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> talks and <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>
               </p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> said the Soviets, too,
                        looked forward to the September talks and hoped for accomplishments in
                        improving what could not be considered normal relations. Soviet desires,
                        indeed, go further: they would like relations on the basis of friendship,
                        and they note with regret that the U.S. never talks of friendship but treats
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as an enemy. As for agenda, both
                        sides would be free in September to raise any questions they wanted. The
                        possibility of a joint statement on the start of <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> negotiations was under discussion in the <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> channel and <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> had been authorized to inform <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> that the Soviets would be
                        prepared to begin investigative negotiations November 17 and preferred
                        Geneva as the site—mainly because facilities seemed more adequate there. He
                        considered a November start desirable since the U.S. delegation would
                        doubtless want a break for Christmas and it would be well to allow time for
                        extensive discussions before the break.</p>
                    <pb n="227" facs="0258" xml:id="pg_227"/>
                    <p>5. Charge responded that, in respect to basing our relations on friendship,
                        the U.S. would also desire this in principle. However, we would be less than
                        candid if we did not make clear that Soviet actions and policies stand in
                        contradiction to the principle of friendship. Before we can think of
                        friendship, we must resolve these serious issues and no one will be more
                        pleased than we if we are able to do so.</p>
                    <p>6. As for preparations for <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> negotiations,
                        Charge expressed pleasure that preparations were proceeding smoothly in the
                        channel established for that purpose. He noted that, as the Secretary had
                        made clear in his recent address, we are well along in our preparations for
                        these talks and hope that the Soviets will be prepared for meaningful
                        discussions. He noted, however, that persistent Soviet efforts to portray
                        the U.S. attitude as less than serious serve only to complicate the process
                        and prospects for progress, and added that he was particularly disturbed by
                        the distorted reports in the Soviet media on the Secretary’s speech on arms
                        control.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> replied that the Soviets
                        are indeed prepared for serious negotiations on <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> and have been prepared for a long time. As for Soviet
                        accusations of U.S. procrastination, these were based on the facts: the
                        administration had made it clear that it was in no hurry to discuss arms
                        control with the Soviet Union, it proceeded to discuss <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> negotiations only under the pressure of
                        its allies, and then it ostentatiously pictured exchanges on trivial
                        questions as serious discussions.</p>
                    <p>8. Charge took strong issue with <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>’s allegations of U.S. “procrastination,” pointing
                        out that careful preparations are an indication of our seriousness of
                        intent, and efforts to picture them in any other light are simply unfounded.
                        He then turned to Afghanistan as one of the principal issues which required
                        resolution if U.S.-Soviet relations are to improve substantially.</p>
                    <p>Afghanistan</p>
                    <p>9. After Charge delivered talking points provided by Department, <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> said he could reveal that the
                        Soviets had the day before given an official written answer to <persName corresp="#p_CLP_1">Carrington</persName>, reiterating, as he had been
                        told at the time, that the initiative was unrealistic and unacceptable. The
                        written answer had been sent because there was continuing speculation that
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was reflecting on the matter. The
                        answer would not surprise nor be hard to understand. The Soviets had
                        proposed talks on the international aspects, but not to exclude the Afghans.
                        The British proposal would have excluded them and also addressed Afghan
                        internal affairs. The proposal was a camouflage and not made with any
                        expectation it would be accepted. The U.S. is not really interested in a
                        settlement, and proved this by its action in influencing the Pakistanis away
                        from bilateral talks they had initially agreed upon.</p>
                    <pb n="228" facs="0259" xml:id="pg_228"/>
                    <p>10. Charge said that he was distressed to hear that the Soviets considered
                        their rejection of the EC–10 proposal as final, since this proposal offered
                        a reasonable basis for negotiating a solution. The Soviet reaction was all
                        the more deplorable since the EC–10 initiative flowed from the <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> suggestion of an international
                        conference. The Soviets often accuse the West of not taking Soviet proposals
                        seriously, but when we do, the much-publicized proposals turn out to be
                        meaningless. Furthermore, the Soviets must recognize that, in rejecting
                        efforts by the international community to find a solution to this problem,
                        they are choosing to perpetuate a serious disturbance to the international
                        order and a grave impediment to improved US-Soviet relations. The problem
                        will not go away. It is with us and must be addressed.</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> responded with an
                        emotional outburst, accusing the U.S. and China of wishing only to
                        perpetuate the fighting in Afghanistan in order to increase tension and
                        justify an arms build-up. He reiterated, in great detail, accusations that
                        the U.S. brought pressure to bear on Pakistan to change its position on
                        direct talks.</p>
                    <p>12. Charge observed that he had attempted to make our points in a
                        non-contentious fashion, assuming that <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> thoroughly understood the details of our attitude
                        and the reasons for it. However, in the face of <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>’s unfounded accusations, he was compelled to
                        point out that the basic problem in Afghanistan is the fact that the Soviet
                        Union is attempting to impose a puppet regime on Afghanistan in opposition
                        to the wishes of the population. A true national-liberation struggle is
                        going on there, and the only way to solve it is to remove Soviet troops and
                        let the Afghans settle their own affairs. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>’s accusations were not only unfounded; they are
                        irrelevant since they do not address the real issue. If the Soviet Union
                        continues to refuse to deal seriously with reasonable proposals to solve the
                        problem, then Afghanistan will continue to burden our relationship and make
                        agreements of all types much more difficult.</p>
                    <p>Arms Control</p>
                    <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> picked up on this
                        reference to linkage by asserting that U.S. statements on the issue are
                        contradictory. On the one hand we say the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> process will be difficult if Afghanistan is not solved,
                        while on the other, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                        has said publicly that <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and
                        Afghanistan are not connected. Charge inquired when the Secretary had made
                        the alleged statement, and <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>
                        referred to an observation that the SALT–II Treaty would not have been
                        ratified even in the absence of an Afghanistan problem. Charge pointed out
                        that <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> was taking the
                        Secretary’s words out of context and distorting them. As he recalled the
                        statement, it was that the SALT–II Treaty had sufficient defects that it
                        would not have won ratification <pb n="229" facs="0260" xml:id="pg_229"/>even if the Soviets had not invaded Afghanistan. This, of course, was not
                        to say that Afghanistan had no effect on the Senate’s judgment of the
                        utility of agreements with the Soviet Union, or that it does not affect the
                        current prospects for U.S.-Soviet relations.</p>
                    <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> then launched into a
                        disjointed, shotgun polemic, asserting that Afghanistan was just a cover for
                        a U.S. policy decision to wreck the basic principle of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, which is equality and equal security.
                        He asserted that statements by administration officials indicated such
                        misunderstanding about the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreements
                        that it was clear the administration was not seriously studying and
                        reviewing the subject. The Soviet Union was in complete compliance with
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> but the U.S. had violated
                        provisions on non-circumvention by preparations to put into Europe weapons
                        which could hit the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. The Soviets had
                        not increased their capabilities but the U.S. was upsetting the balance. The
                        Soviets had concluded SALT–I despite the fact that the U.S. was at the time
                        waging aggression against Vietnam. Charge responded that he could not accept
                        a thing <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> was saying. The
                        Soviets might consider it useful propaganda but he hoped the Soviet
                        Government was realistic enough to know it was not true. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> was grasping at straws. The U.S.
                        was in full compliance with all agreements and indeed is still waiting for
                        satisfactory replies to questions on Soviet compliance with several
                        agreements. Even if SALT–II were a formally ratified agreement, which of
                        course it is not, plans for <gloss target="#t_LRTNF_1">LRTNF</gloss>
                        deployments in Europe do not violate it, since the weapons are not strategic
                        as defined by the treaty. The allegation that Pershing II deployment would
                        upset a “balance” is absurd: it was the Soviet deployment of SS–20’s which
                        upset the nuclear balance in Europe and planned <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> deployments are only a belated response to this. Finally,
                        in respect to <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>’s reference
                        to the 1972 summit, Charge pointed out that while he could not accept that
                        Vietnam and Afghanistan were comparable events, he would note that SALT–I
                        was not concluded until the U.S. had already undertaken a phased withdrawal
                        from Vietnam, and that throughout this process the Soviets backed the North
                        Vietnamese to the hilt—and after the U.S. withdrew the Soviet Union
                        supported North Vietnamese in breaking the agreements reached. These
                        observations led to an introduction of the talking points on Kampuchea.</p>
                    <p>Kampuchea</p>
                    <p>15. When Charge presented the talking points, <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> complained that the U.S. had not condemned
                        Chinese aggression against Vietnam and he labeled the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Conference on Kampuchea a U.S. creation,
                        called for, organized and structured in Washington. The conference was not
                        in accord with the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolution, which
                        called for participation by all parties involved. Charge responded that in
                        no way <pb n="230" facs="0261" xml:id="pg_230"/>was it a U.S. creation; it
                        was an <gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss> initiative with wide support
                        and participation of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> as a whole. We
                        regretted the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s negative reaction and
                        hoped it would urge Vietnam to cooperate. It was an effort to find a way out
                        of a situation, like Afghanistan, which had been caused by the intervention
                        of foreign military force. These situations were burdensome to
                        international, regional and bilateral relations. If the Soviets wanted
                        seriously to settle them, they would find a ready partner; otherwise we
                        would draw the appropriate conclusion. However, in regard both to
                        Afghanistan and Kampuchea, he hoped the Soviets would review their position
                        carefully so that the discussions in New York could be more productive.</p>
                    <p>Poland</p>
                    <p>16. When the Charge introduced the talking points on Poland, <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> adopted a frigid tone and said
                        the most correct response he could give to the remarks was that it would be
                        inappropriate to discuss internal Polish affairs, and that urging the
                        Soviets to increase their economic aid to Poland was also out of order. The
                        U.S. knew very well what the Soviets were doing in this regard. The U.S. had
                        no moral or other right to raise this. Charge pointed out that he had not
                        suggested a discussion of Polish internal affairs, but that the U.S., as a
                        supplier of aid to Poland, had not only a right but indeed a duty to urge
                        others to join in the effort to provide assistance.</p>
                    <p>Central America/Nicaragua’s Military Buildup</p>
                    <p>17. In response to Charge’s points on this subject, <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> came back immediately by asking
                        “Do I understand that you are proposing to renew the talks on conventional
                        arms transfer?” Charge replied that his statement contained no such
                        proposal, but stood on its own. <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> then asked on what basis the question was raised.
                        Is the U.S. reasserting the Monroe Doctrine? The Charge said that he was
                        expressing U.S. concern with dangerous arms transfers in the region and with
                        those countries which are ultimate sources of the arms. If we were
                        discussing the Monroe Doctrine, he added, we would have to talk about a lot
                        more than Nicaragua.</p>
                    <p>China</p>
                    <p>18. When the points on China were raised, <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> objected that it seemed that the U.S. could be
                        friends with China but not the Soviet Union, and he also heard talk about
                        the coincidence of strategic interests. Three successive Presidents of the
                        U.S. had given assurances about not supplying arms to China, but the Soviets
                        must conclude that these are no longer valid. Charge pointed out that
                        policies are made in the context of events; events had developed in recent
                        years so that it was anomalous to classify China as a power hostile to U.S.
                        interests. The decision not to deny in principle any supply of arms to China
                        was a logical development of U.S.-Chinese relations. There is simply no <pb n="231" facs="0262" xml:id="pg_231"/>reason for treating China in this
                        respect differently from other friendly countries who are not allies. What
                        concerns us, <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> said, is that
                        the U.S. considers the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> an enemy and
                        the Chinese as friends. Charge replied that Soviet actions themselves left
                        us no choice but to consider the Soviet Union an adversary power; recent
                        Chinese actions had given us no such cause. While we do not enjoy and do not
                        seek adversarial relations with the Soviet Union, we cannot ignore Soviet
                        actions which have created this situation.</p>
                    <p>19. Summing up, Charge said that he hoped that the Soviet leaders would give
                        further thought to the various concerns we have been conveying over the past
                        months, and that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would come
                        to New York prepared to discuss them in a constructive spirit, rather than
                        simply reiterating debating points. We knew that their professed suspicions
                        that the U.S. does not desire an improvement of relations were groundless,
                        but if the Soviet leaders proceed as if agreement is impossible and continue
                        to pursue those policies which have created the tensions in the
                        relationship, then of course there can indeed be no improvement. Therefore,
                        the Soviets should resolve their doubts on this score by coming to the table
                        with proposals designed to reduce rather than perpetuate these tensions.</p>
                    <p>20. As Charge was leaving the office, <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> remarked—rather uncharacteristically—that while
                        he and Charge have rarely agreed during their series of meetings, he found
                        them “not unuseful” (nebezpoleznye), and hoped they would continue upon
                        Charge’s return from Washington.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Before leaving on my well-earned vacation (August 3 to August 14 and August
                        24 to August 28), I would like to summarize my thoughts about the
                        outstanding world crises involving the Soviet Union and the Communist Bloc.
                        There are three of those, in descending order of urgency (though not
                        necessarily of importance): Poland, Israel-Lebanon, and China. (S)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Poland</p>
                    <p>Poland is entering a period of acute economic crisis: this crisis has major
                        social and political implications. The economy is in shambles as basic items
                        of food and other necessities of everyday living are disappearing. I am told
                        that thousands of combines and trucks necessary to collect the coming
                        harvest are standing idle for lack of spare parts. If the situation
                        deteriorates further there is a possibility of massive strikes and a social
                        breakdown; this, in turn, could lead to the introduction of emergency laws
                        and the gradual reestablishment of controls by pro-Soviet forces which are
                        continuing to reorganize their forces. (The <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Jaruzelski</persName>-Kania Government could easily swing the other way
                        under such conditions.) Should this occur, the Soviet Union could bring
                        Poland back into the fold without recourse to armed intervention. The
                        consequences would be catastrophic:</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>—The cause of economic and political reform in Eastern Europe would be
                            discredited for a long time on the grounds that freedom spells chaos—and
                            yet the best hope for world peace lies in Communist regimes being
                            compelled to undergo unpalatable reforms.</p>
                        <p>—The Polish armed forces, now of little use to the Warsaw Pact, would be
                            revivified, significantly enhancing the fighting capabilities of the
                            Communist Bloc.</p>
                        <p>—European neutralists would have grounds to say “We told you so” and
                            accuse us of alarmist behavior: clearly there is no Soviet military
                            danger to anyone. (S)</p>

                    <p>To prevent such a catastrophe from happening, two things should be done:</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>—Some form of immediate financial help to bail Poland out for the next
                            few months, with no strings attached; it appears there is support in
                            Congress for such an emergency measure.</p>
                        <p>—Coordinated Allied action in the form of a mini-Marshall Plan that would
                            entail both a realistic Polish reconstruction program over so many
                            years, possibly under the supervision of the IMF, and large-scale Allied
                            assistance. (S)</p>
               </quote>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Middle East</p>
                    <p>Here it seems to me that the gravest danger lies in the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> buildup with Libyan and Soviet assistance.
                        The intention, if I perceive it correctly, is to transform the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> gunmen in Lebanon from a hit-and-run force
                        into a modern army that would spearhead an assault on Israel. This army
                        would not be restricted in its activities by the kind of internal and
                        international considerations that affect, say, a Jordan or even a Syria. All
                        this was missed in the journalistic hubbub about Israeli bombing of Beirut.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>I offer no proposals on how to cope with this major problem. It seems to me,
                        however, that in public pronouncements on the Middle East, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> officials should take into account
                        the following facts:</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>—The major Arab states, notably Saudi Arabia, have no alternative to
                            U.S. support—they have nowhere else to go, no matter what they threaten;
                            for this reason they need not be appeased and should be pressured to
                            give up support of the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>—The real problem in the Middle East is not Israel’s refusal to recognize
                            the Palestinians but the refusal of all Arab states, Egypt excepted, to
                            recognize Israel: this plain fact ought to be reiterated in all our
                            pronouncements until it is perceived as the kind of axiom that it really
                            is.</p>
                        <p>—To the extent that I know and understand <persName corresp="#p_BM_2">Begin</persName>, threats and punishments make him ornery: he needs
                            reassurances. I am quite confident that his willingness to agree to an
                            armistice in Lebanon was due mainly to the supportive words of the
                            President. This is the only way to approach the man. (S)</p>
               </quote>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">China</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union is genuinely worried about our improving relations with
                        China: this is no mere bluff, as is so much else of what they say. Their
                        military, who do not make policy but have a very strong influence on it, are
                        deeply concerned by the prospect of having to plan for a possible two-front
                        war against two modern armies. This must arouse tempting thoughts of
                        preventive war. (Lest we forget, the German General Staff in 1914 decided to
                        press for war because it found that the modernization plan of the Russian
                        armies, carried out with <pb n="234" facs="0265" xml:id="pg_234"/>French
                        help and meant to be concluded three years later, would have spelled the
                        doom of the Schlieffen Plan.) It seems to me most important as soon as
                        possible to:</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>—formulate a policy of rewards and punishments for the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in terms of our military
                            relationship with China; and</p>
                        <p>—communicate it clearly and forcefully to Moscow. (S)</p>

                    <p>I have made this point before and only wish to reemphasize it. (U)</p>

                  <persName corresp="#p_MJF_1">Matlock</persName>
                        Presentation</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_MJF_1">Matlock</persName> (Charge, Embassy Moscow) led
                        off with an assessment of the harsh Soviet polemics against the U.S. as a
                        predictable response to clear and effective policies of the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration. Our basic message
                        was that improvement in our bilateral relationship was only possible if
                        certain of their policies were rectified; heading that list was Afghanistan
                        and the Soviet military buildup. The Soviet attitude that the U.S. should
                        treat bygones as bygones was completely unacceptable to us. <persName corresp="#p_MJF_1">Matlock</persName> expressed his belief that the
                        Soviet leadership understands exactly what we’re talking about, although
                        their statements, of course, give no indication of this and instead
                        concentrate on charges that the U.S. is seeking to create tensions in order
                        to justify a military buildup.</p>
                    <p>The effect of the strained atmosphere has had a mixed effect on the Moscow
                        Embassy. In terms of doing business, there was no problem getting
                        appointments promptly and at the right level; socially it was another story.
                        At one point, Soviets were being told not to attend U.S. functions although
                        many came despite the instructions. This period has now largely passed.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_MJF_1">Matlock</persName> gave a strong endorsement of
                        reciprocity and illustrated the effectiveness of this tool by the Embassy’s
                        retaliation against the <pb n="235" facs="0266" xml:id="pg_235"/>
                  <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> Institute’s institution of an Embassy
                        boycott. The Institute ended its boycott about six weeks after the Embassy
                        began to reciprocate. The intent of reciprocity is not to punish the Soviets
                        but to ensure that we both enjoy a fair and balanced relationship. We should
                        remember that in the Soviet Union there is always central direction of even
                        small matters. <gloss target="#t_ICCUSA_1">ICCUSA</gloss> provides a
                        mechanism through which we can all work together to establish greater
                        reciprocity in U.S.-Soviet relations.</p>
                    <p>In response to questions, <persName corresp="#p_MJF_1">Matlock</persName>
                        offered the following comments:</p>
                    <p>West European-Siberian Gas Pipeline. Soviet interest was high although they
                        had scaled back original plans for two pipelines to one. Perhaps this was
                        due to realization that Soviet reserves were not as great as originally
                        thought or perhaps to the difficulty of financing the enormously expansive
                        project. Soviet interest was based on economic (source of much needed hard
                        currency) and political grounds (increased influence in Western Europe). He
                        noted that the Soviets were hard bargainers, although perhaps too zealous
                        for their own good; the delays caused by their haggling over a better deal
                        led to higher costs in the end because of the effects of inflation.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>. Always difficult to predict
                        the longevity of others, particularly in the case of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> who has reportedly been on his
                        last legs for years. He sticks to a limited schedule paced by long rests;
                        the frequency of his public appearances has not changed much in recent
                        years. The Soviets were apparently so concerned, however, about his stamina
                        that they only televised several minutes of his long address to the last
                        Party Congress. In private sessions, <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> sticks to his written notes and must be frequently
                        prodded. Although his mental alertness and stamina are limited, he plays a
                        valued role in what has always been a consensus leadership. It is clear that
                        no one has been groomed as <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                        successor although <persName corresp="#p_KAP_1">Kirilenko</persName>
                        (possibly <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName>) will likely
                        serve as an interim leader.</p>
                    <p>Reciprocity and Chancery Construction. Work is now proceeding more or less on
                        schedule. Soviet customs have been subjecting us to costly and cumbersome
                        procedures which should be eased when we can clear incoming material at the
                        new warehouse which should be completed in September.</p>
                    <p>Soviet Reaction to Polish Events. Soviet concerns appear to have subsided
                        after the Polish Party Congress. Barring a wave of strikes and the outbreak
                        of anarchy, Soviets appear to have passed the point at which they would
                        intervene. They are well aware of the enormous consequences of military
                        intervention. They will continue, however, to exert pressure on Poland since
                        what they are witnessing there is theoretically unacceptable.</p>
                    <p>Soviet Surveillance of Embassy Personnel and Visitors. There has been no
                        change in the level aside from the flurry of harassment <pb n="236" facs="0267" xml:id="pg_236"/>following the Aeroflot/Customs incident,
                        which had been annoying but not dangerous. <persName corresp="#p_MJF_1">Matlock</persName> stressed that he was certainly in favor of law
                        enforcement, but that the handling of the aforementioned incident pointed up
                        the necessity of considering in advance what signal our actions will send
                        the Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_MJF_1">Matlock</persName> said the
                        Soviets interpreted the incident as a clear indication that we were going
                        out of our way to harass them.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Overview</p>
                    <p>
                  <gloss target="#t_EUR_1">EUR</gloss> Deputy Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> summed up the Ottawa Summit which
                        produced general agreement on the need to control strategic trade with the
                        Soviet Union and would be followed shortly by a high-level <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> Meeting. <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> announced that the President had just decided to
                        allow Caterpillar to sell one hundred pipelayers to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Our decision was based on the fact that
                        the technology involved was not new or unique and that an alternative deal
                        from the Japanese was readily available to the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> discussed U.S. financial
                        assistance to Poland which exceeds that of any other Western nation this
                        year. Our total for 1981 was raised to $715 million dollars with the recent
                        decision to provide 350,000 tons of corn under PL480. The other major
                        creditor nations have been informed of our decision and we are urging them
                        to do more to assist Poland. The economic situation there is very serious
                        and it will be difficult for them to work out a stabilization and economic
                        reform package for which Solidarity’s support is essential.</p>
                    <p>Turning to Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> noted
                        that the Soviets had formally rejected the <gloss target="#t_EC101">EC
                            10</gloss> proposal which we nonetheless will continue to support. Our
                            pre-<gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> consultations are designed to
                        keep international pressure on the Soviets over Afghanistan. This issue will

                        of our relations, we will hammer home the point that our insistence on
                        restraint by the Soviet Union and its proxies is not a fleeting fancy but an
                        enduring policy. At the same time, we will demonstrate our willingness to
                        cooperate with the Soviets should they moderate their international
                        behavior.</p>

                        negotiation of a new grain agreement after the expiration of the current

                        and State. The U.S. position should be enhanced by the dwindling estimates
                        of the 1981 Soviet grain crop (currently pegged at 190 million metric tons
                        by the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>) which will be the third

                        unwillingness to receive a delegation from the House Agriculture Committee
                        which had planned to visit in August.</p>

                        should continue on our present course barring any substantial changes in the
                        political climate. <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> noted

                        suggested that a memo on our exchanges policy from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> to his Cabinet counterparts would be
                        useful. (Since the <gloss target="#t_ICCUSA_1">ICCUSA</gloss> Chairman,

                    <p>• It is apparent that Soviet leader <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Leonid

                        is being propped up politically as well as physically by a group that is
                        attempting to carry out <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                        policies and this group seems lacking in military representation.</p>
                    <p>• On more than one occasion <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        had to be escorted from a meeting because of his incoherence or inability to

                        leaned forward and could not return to an upright position.</p>
                    <p>• There were times when <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s

                            staff from 1983–1988.</note> who is currently in Moscow on an exchange
                        program, Valentin Falin, a ranking official of the Soviet central
                        committee’s international information department, offered the following
                        observations on U.S.-Soviet relations:</p>
                    <p>• Although some in the Kremlin accept that the administration needs time to
                        develop a comprehensive policy, others believe a definitive policy package
                        has already been adopted and is being implemented by the “<persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> group” (<persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Meese</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName>, Ikle
                        and <persName corresp="#p_PR_2">Pipes</persName>)—“the engineers behind a
                        worldwide anti-Soviet conspiracy.”</p>
                    <pb n="239" facs="0270" xml:id="pg_239"/>
                    <p>• The administration made a serious mistake by initially taking a harsh
                        anti-Soviet “tone,” and the Soviets hope the U.S. will not “paint itself
                        into a corner with its rhetoric.”</p>
                    <p>• At present, the U.S. and Soviet Union are like “two elephants in a crockery
                        store . . . relations are standing on very thin ice, and the danger of
                        miscalculation is very high.”</p>
                    <p>• While he and other “consultants” to the central committee understand the
                        need for the administration to “finish acting out their fantasies,” it is
                        “high time” to present the Soviets with a coherent, understandable
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>• “The Soviets are ready to begin talks on any subject right away . . .
                        nothing is non-negotiable.”</p>
                    <p>Falin concluded by commenting that “we really don’t care what your policy is
                        anymore, just let us know what it is.” (S)</p>

                        deliver the following message from the Secretary to Soviet Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. If <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> is not available, you may deliver

                    <p>3. Begin text. Dear Mr. Minister: We have given careful consideration to the
                        views of your government concerning relations between the United States and
                        the People’s Republic of China as conveyed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> on June 17<note n="2" xml:id="d81fn2">See <ref target="#d63">Document 63</ref>.</note> and
                        July 2.<note n="3" xml:id="d81fn3">See <ref target="#d69">Document
                            69</ref>.</note> Although the position of the United States on the
                        specific question of possible transfers of arms to the People’s Republic of
                        China has previously been conveyed <pb n="240" facs="0271" xml:id="pg_240"/>to you, I am writing in an effort to ensure that the Soviet Union has a
                        full and accurate understanding of that position.</p>
                    <p>Despite the strains in relations between our two countries this
                        administration has not characterized our relationship as one of “hostility.”
                        It is, therefore, regrettable that you have chosen in your recent
                        communications to characterize the development of our relationship with the
                        People’s Republic of China as being motivated by hostile intent toward the
                        Soviet Union. The policies which we follow toward the People’s Republic of
                        China are developed in our respective national interests and are not
                        specifically aimed at any third country.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, it must be pointed out that the United States would not
                        accept an attempt by any third country to influence our bilateral
                        relationship with this important country, or any other country. We are aware
                        of no “assurances” by this or any previous United States administration by
                        which the Soviet Union acquired a right of veto in this regard.</p>
                    <p>The development of relations in the security area between the United States
                        and China is a normal part of the process of the broadening of contacts
                        between our two countries. As China’s policies and practices are not
                        threatening to the United States, nor to our friends and allies, it is no
                        longer consistent with the present state of our relationship for the United
                        States to treat China as an adversary. Indeed, as I stated on my recent
                        Asian trip, the United States regards China as a friendly country with which
                        we are not allied, but with which we share many common interests.</p>
                    <p>As for the question of potential arms transfers, since we have authorized as
                        yet no specific sales to China, it is a misinterpretation of our position to
                        speak of our having embarked upon a policy of “arming China.” Any request
                        which we might receive from the Chinese will be carefully weighed on its
                        merits, with due regard given to its appropriateness, the status of our
                        bilateral relationship with the Chinese, the effects on others in the area,
                        and our appreciation of the needs of international peace and security.</p>
                    <p>Thus, our decisions will not be made in a political or military vacuum. In
                        this connection, we cannot help noting the fact that the Soviet Union, in
                        formulating and carrying out its own policies, has persistently failed to
                        take into account our frequently expressed concerns over the impact on
                        U.S.-Soviet relations of Soviet actions in third areas, including Southwest
                        Asia, Southeast Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.</p>
                    <p>Let me assure you, Mr. Minister, that our purpose in improving relations with
                        the People’s Republic of China is not to complicate relations with the
                        Soviet Union. The United States remains interested <pb n="241" facs="0272" xml:id="pg_241"/>in the improvement of U.S.-Soviet relations in all
                        areas, based on the principles of reciprocity and restraint.</p>

                        the latest <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> proposal, you should draw on
                        the following points:</p>
                    <p>—It is the illegal invasion and occupation of Afghanistan by Soviet troops
                        that have caused the Afghan crisis.</p>
                    <p>—The Afghan proposal ignores <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions
                        which call for the immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops and thus—point the
                        way toward a settlement.</p>
                    <p>—We regret that the Soviet Union has not found these <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions or the EC Conference proposal acceptable—they
                        would help lead the crisis toward a political solution. The Afghan proposal
                        clearly does not advance this purpose.</p>

                        himself:</p>
                    <p>—In part because he’s known every American President and Secretary of State
                        since Roosevelt and Cordell Hull, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> has a certain equanimity and serenity about
                        US-Soviet relations. Tough and business-like but not emotional, nor prone to
                        cheap shots—at least in private.<note n="3" xml:id="d82fn3">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> wrote a checkmark next to this
                            paragraph.</note>
               </p>
                    <pb n="242" facs="0273" xml:id="pg_242"/>
                    <p>—If he opts to speak in Russian instead of using his excellent English, it
                        could be a tactical decision to show certain stiffness. You might try to
                        preempt by referring at beginning to his English.</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> has grown in importance;
                        Politburo relies heavily on him. When combined with fact that he’s good at
                        catching nuances and we believe reports back accurately (perhaps unlike
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>), it’s critical that you
                        present your overall approach at length and with precision. Everything
                        before is prelude to this first act.</p>
                    <p>—Another reason for precision is that Soviets have tried to twist statements
                        we’ve made in their conversations with our Allies and others.</p>
                    <p>—After his entirely predictable “injured party” tour d’horizon, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> will probe yours. He listens
                        carefully and asks lots of questions about any proposition. But he holds
                        back as long as possible in presenting even what he’s authorized to do. So
                        you may have to prompt him to say his complete lines; asking “do you have
                        nothing else to say on X?”</p>
                    <p>—While <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> has a broad grasp of
                        key issues, and can fake it on almost any subject, he’s no expert on
                        military questions. For example, it’s a waste of time to debate nuclear
                        doctrine with him.</p>
                    <p>—In general, debate with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> is
                        not productive. We should just state what U.S. perceptions and policies are,
                        and that Soviets must deal with these as a fact of life—whether they agree
                        with them or not.</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> has a dry sense of humor.
                        Takes some effort to arouse. Only marginally worth the effort. Generally
                        better to have an air of “civilized firmness.”</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">On Our Approach</p>
                    <p>We’ll incorporate some of their substantive suggestions on specific issues
                        like Cuba, military buildup, etc. in the talking points now being drafted.
                        Here are more general observations Hal, <persName corresp="#p_SB_1">Brent</persName> and Bill had on your approach.</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s main objectives at this
                        meeting are to try to test this Administration’s mettle, to see how serious
                        we are about our more robust approach, to determine what chinks there are in
                        our armour, and to see whether we want any sort of on-going
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p>—The Soviets still have doubts that we will be able to sustain our new
                        approach, but they are nervous. It’s likely they interpreted the
                        Vietnam/Watergate era as a permanent change and are now uncertain.</p>
                    <p>—Thus your main objective should be calmly but clearly to communicate that
                        the main lines of the Administration’s new approach are entirely fixed and
                        clear. The Soviets should focus on the overall direction rather than
                        specific events here (i.e., adjustments in overall increases in defense
                        budget), in Western Europe or elsewhere.</p>
                    <pb n="243" facs="0274" xml:id="pg_243"/>
                    <p>—We must make clear what our interests are and what specific Soviet actions
                        over the past decade have encroached upon them. This doesn’t mean we reject
                        the Soviet Union as a major power with interests, political prestige, etc.
                        It does mean that military intrusions which attempt to shift the
                        geopolitical/strategic balance in areas vital to the United States and not
                        to the Soviet Union now have called forth a serious and sustained American
                        response.</p>
                    <p>—We shouldn’t be in any hurry. The Soviets are patient and we should be too.
                        We don’t want to give any indication that we are the demandeur, or that we
                        are trying to negotiate or cut deals in New York. At the same time we should
                        indicate that we are prepared to maintain a serious dialogue. Thus agreement
                        on another, early meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was strongly recommended as the main outcome of your
                            <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> sessions.<note n="4" xml:id="d82fn4">

                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> is currently in good health
                        and seems well rested from his vacation. He is as articulate as ever, and
                        displays the quickness of reaction and mastery of facts for which he has
                        long been noted. His approach is that of a consumate and pragmatic
                        geopolitician; he rarely indulges in ideological discussion, and seems to
                        have little patience for it. Despite the dour countenance he often displays
                        in public, he has a sense of humor and a knack for wry jokes and homey but
                        opposite similes to drive home his points. His mind-set is relatively
                        closed, however, and he is not noted for seizing upon new ideas. On the
                        contrary, he usually forces new facts into the mental pigeonholes formed
                        years ago and is not easily swayed from his preconceptions. His basic
                        instinct is to continue doggedly along the course which has been set,
                        relying on persistence and consistency to wear his opponents down. He is,
                        however, more realistic than (for example) a <persName corresp="#p_SMA_1">Suslov</persName>, knows the world outside the Soviet Union far better,
                        and is more capable of doing geopolitical sums which reflect the actual
                        situation. This means that, however closed his mind may be, he is more
                        likely than many of his Politburo colleagues to adjust policy in accord with
                        real or potential power factors.</p>
                    <p>3. His status: <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> has now been
                        Foreign Minister for over 24 years, and his authority has steadily grown.
                        Initially, he may have been little more than one of several foreign policy
                        advisers with responsibility for execution of routine overt Soviet
                        diplomacy. However, since his elevation to full Politburo status in 1973,
                        his close working relationship with <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> and his steady public exposure as a foreign policy
                        spokesman second only to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        have given him an authority which <pb n="245" facs="0276" xml:id="pg_245"/>may approach (but probably not match) that which <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> exercised in the U.S.G. during
                        the Ford administration. I would presume that his influence is now probably
                        at a historical peak, what with <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> less active and less mentally agile, and with most
                        Politburo members senior to him showing distinct signs of senility.
                        Nevertheless, he does not make Soviet foreign policy on his own, and has
                        competitors for influence in the upper councils. On matters affecting
                        military policy, <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName>’s influence
                        would equal or exceed his. He probably has little patience for, and limited
                        influence over, the ideological orientation of figures like <persName corresp="#p_SMA_1">Suslov</persName> and (probably) Ponomarev. The
                        latter are probably more insistent on support to “national-liberation”
                        movements and are capable of providing independent staffing for the
                        Politburo on foreign policy questions through the Central Committee
                        apparatus in which they are entrenched. They would draw on <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> reporting and classified analyses by
                        institutes such as <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>’s, in
                        addition to that provided by <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s ministry. This group (along of course with <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>) probably exercises more sway over
                        Soviet covert activities than does <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. (Incidentally, <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>’s use of the Central Committee channel and his
                        occasional direct access to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        probably mean that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>—like
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>—views him as an annoying
                        kibitzer rather than an ally.) Having said the above, I would caution that
                        the inner workings of the Politburo are still largely obscure to us, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> is an undeviating team
                        player; if he is overruled, he will never give us signs of it. Unfortunately
                        neither the Soviet press nor our Soviet contacts here feed us with
                        tantalizing tidbits on policy disputes in the Politburo.</p>
                    <p>4. Tactics for the Bilateral: <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s principal objective will be to move the U.S. into
                        negotiation of arms control issues, particularly <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>, without making
                        concessions in other areas. He will hammer hard against linkage, as he did
                        with the Senators. He will probably come on as the “wounded party,” with
                        repetition of some of the themes he played to <persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Cranston</persName> and Mathias: the U.S. illogically suspended the
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> process, the U.S. is an
                        unreliable partner with changes in policy every four years, Soviet
                        intentions are pure and it is the U.S. which is flexing its muscles
                        dangerously, heightening tensions and fanning a war psychosis.</p>
                    <p>5. Such an approach has the obvious tactical aim of putting the Secretary on
                        the defensive, in effect challenging him to “prove” U.S. good faith and
                        reliability by moving toward the Soviet position that arms control should be
                        negotiated without regard to other issues. Not all of it will be sham,
                        however. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and the Soviet
                        leadership are seriously concerned with their inability to get a long-term
                        “fix” on U.S. policy; they genuinely find the major U.S. policy shifts that
                        they experience every four years a perplexing and frustrating experience.
                            <pb n="246" facs="0277" xml:id="pg_246"/>They probably also honestly
                        suspect that current U.S. policy aims at strategic superiority and have
                        genuine doubts (which they are too cagey to admit) that they could match us
                        in an all-out arms race.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> will be a master of his
                        brief and will make every effort to channel the discussion into those areas
                        of primary interest to the Soviets. Although he is capable of employing
                        filibustering tactics (as he did with the Senators), I doubt that he would
                        insult the Secretary with excessively long winded lectures. But he will
                        bolster his presentation with frequent examples which cry out for
                        refutation, and it would probably be a mistake to rise automatically to the
                        bait, since this would in effect enable him to determine the agenda of the
                        discussion.</p>
                    <p>7. I believe the Secretary can best cope with these tactics by insisting on a
                        full discussion of the priority items on our agenda. If <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> chooses to play the “offended
                        party” role, the Secretary should counter in kind with a clear exposition of
                        those Soviet actions which have brought us to the current unsatisfactory
                        relationship. (This should be done in any event, but the tone and context
                        might be adjusted to the emotional level <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> chooses to adopt.)</p>
                    <p>8. One favorite <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> tactic is
                        simply to ignore significant points raised by his interlocutor, and to talk
                        about other things until time runs out. The Secretary should not let a sense
                        of politeness deter him from returning repeatedly to points of interest to
                        us if <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> proves evasive in
                        responding to them.</p>
                    <p>9. As the Secretary’s agenda is worked out, it would be well to bear in mind
                        that the Soviets will take it as a clear signal that any subject omitted is
                        secondary to the ones raised, in our assessment of priorities. This does not
                        mean that the Secretary must provide a definitive catalog of all our
                        desiderata—which would be quite impossible in any case—but simply that if he
                        does not talk about (for example) compliance issues or mention that we still
                        expect more on Sverdlovsk, the Soviet inference will be that our concerns on
                        these matters are not really very acute. For those subjects raised, the
                        Soviets will be attentive to such matters as the length of time spent on
                        them and the vigor of their presentation as direct clues to U.S. priorities.
                        Perfunctory mention of a subject can be interpreted as signaling low
                        priority since the presumption would be that it was read into the record
                        merely to satisfy some interest group or coterie.</p>
                    <p>10. If any portion of the meeting is conducted one-on-one, the opportunity
                        should be used to convey our most important points as directly and pointedly
                        as elementary politeness permits. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, like most Russians, can take straight talk in
                        private. Indeed, they prise it, and the signals given at such a
                        meeting—should one be held—will be <pb n="247" facs="0278" xml:id="pg_247"/>the most important he will bring back to Moscow with him (assuming
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> does not meet with the
                        President).</p>
                    <p>11. His mood: though he never had the benefit of studying the Stanislavsky
                        technique formally, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> is a
                        consummate actor, quite capable of adjusting his performance to what he
                        deems the requirements of the moment. Therefore his underlying mood may well
                        not show very clearly in the actual meetings. However, I am reasonably
                        confident that his real mood will be one combining a deep sense of
                        frustration and genuine concern about the future. The following elements
                        will contribute to it:</p>
                    <p>—Soviet foreign policy has not been notably successful over the past three or
                        four years, and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> knows it.
                        There must be serious questions in his mind whether the Soviets will be able
                        to hold onto the foreign policy gains achieved through the mid-1970’s, or
                        whether they will be forced onto the defensive.</p>
                    <p>—Though it is not his official concern, he will be aware of the serious
                        economic and (potentially) political problems which face the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in the eighties which will limit Soviet
                        capabilities to keep up with an unrestrained arms race without creating even
                        deeper problems of economic development, morale, and possibly political
                        disaffection.</p>
                    <p>—These general concerns will be heightened by two specific ones: Poland and
                        the succession. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, like most
                        Soviet leaders, doubtless realizes that Poland is the most portentious
                        problem—for both foreign and domestic policy—the current leadership has
                        faced in its long tenure. He probably also realizes that it is one which,
                        whatever the Soviet Union does, is almost certain to damage the Soviet
                        position in the long run. On the domestic side, he will be aware that
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s parlous health could
                        result in his death and thus bring about a succession struggle with very
                        little notice. While he can not rationally entertain ambitions for the top
                        position himself, he may face a challenge during any succession “debate” on
                        grounds that Soviet foreign policy has been mismanaged. Certainly, one can
                        make a convincing case on geopolitical grounds that, at the very least,
                        Soviet priorities have been misplaced, and that risky foreign adventures
                        have endangered vital Soviet interests in maintaining a tight hold on
                        Eastern Europe, in avoiding a US-China alliance, and in preventing a
                        resurgence of US strength. Unless <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, in the inner councils, fought the decisions which
                        have brought this situation about (and we have no reason to believe he did,
                        though he may not have initiated them), he could sense personal
                        vulnerability during a period of competition for the succession.</p>
                    <p>—Although I believe that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                        mood will be characterized more by frustration and concern for the future
                        than by sanguine hopes for new Soviet foreign policy triumphs, he will of
                        course not view the future as unrelievedly bleak. He is acutely aware of our
                        problems with <pb n="248" facs="0279" xml:id="pg_248"/>our Western Allies
                        and doubtless understands that our alliances could be severely weakened—to
                        certain Soviet benefit—if we fail to make a good-faith effort to negotiate
                        on principal arms control issues. In specific areas, he doubtless sees
                        opportunities for the future: in exploiting the Arab reaction to Israeli
                        policies in order to undermine the U.S. position with the moderates in the
                        region; in utilizing local disputes and internal weaknesses in the “Third
                        World” to put the U.S. on the defensive; in playing the long game in Iran
                        with the hope that, if the Tudeh can keep its head down during the current
                        chaos, it may emerge as the most effective organized force when Khomeni and
                        the mullahs have totally discredited themselves or killed themselves off. He
                        will also be aware of U.S. domestic factors which may make it difficult for
                        any U.S. administration to commit the full range of U.S. resources to our
                        military capacity. The termination of the limited grain embargo, the dispute
                        over MX basing, and—most of all—the recent drive to trim back early
                        estimates of defense spending to permit a balanced budget in 1984, are
                        doubtless read in Moscow as clear evidence that there are domestic political
                        limits to the U.S. commitment to the competitive side of our
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p>—In brief, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s concern for the
                        future will be real, but he will not view his country as so beset with
                        difficulties that it is forced to a rapprochement with the U.S. whatever the
                        cost. One key question in <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                        mind will be determining what the cost of better relations really is. While
                        we have made clear our dissatisfaction with Soviet policy in many areas, the
                        Soviets probably have no clear fix on where our priorities lie. We have
                        mentioned Afghanistan, Cambodia, Cuban activities, support for terrorism,
                        compliance with existing arms control agreements, Poland, the SS–20’s and
                        Soviet behavior in the Middle East at various times and in various contexts.
                        All of these—and more, of course—are legitimate issues and must be dealt
                        with. However, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and his
                        colleagues are probably in a genuine quandary as to what it would take to
                        start on the road toward a better relationship, and specifically, what it
                        would take to rekindle our interest in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> or SART. Clearly, yielding on all outstanding issues at
                        the outset is not an acceptable price to them, and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> will be alert as to any hints as to
                        where we draw the bottom line on our initial desiderata. Though it is
                        unnecessary and undesirable for the Secretary in effect to write off any
                        important issues between us, some general indication of how Soviet
                        responsiveness in these various areas might affect U.S. policy could provide
                        [garble] to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> which would be
                        useful to us in applying leverage for more acceptable Soviet behavior.</p>
                    <p>—Aside from his desire to determine the price this administration is asking
                        for better relations, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> will be
                        beset with some doubts about the longevity of current U.S. policies. Though
                        the Soviets have <pb n="249" facs="0280" xml:id="pg_249"/>their tactical and
                        propaganda reasons for stressing the point, their complaints about the
                        inconstancy of U.S. policies rest on a foundation of honest perception of
                        wide and (for them) not always predictable swings in U.S. policy, coupled
                        with what they regard as the repeated inability of successive U.S.
                        Presidents to deliver on commitments. Therefore, in addition to trying to
                        determine what the true intentions of the current administration are,
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> will also be making a
                        judgment whether its policy is likely to persist over time or whether it is
                        only a set of passing whims. In order to stress the deep roots in U.S.
                        opinion which support our current approach to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, the Secretary should leave no doubt in <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s mind that it is precisely Soviet
                        actions which have engendered the current U.S. response, and that only a
                        change in the pattern of those actions can prepare the ground for a more
                        harmonious relationship, which inter alia would make arms reduction much
                        easier.</p>
                    <p>12. Although <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s meetings with
                        the Secretary will be critically important in providing clear indicators of
                        the direction of our policy, we should recognize that the Soviets, like
                        ourselves, will look more to actions than to words for clues about our
                        policy. The words will have little effect unless they are seen to be backed
                        by a capability and willingness to act, and this is as true as regards
                        prospective negotiations as it is in respect to moves to strengthen
                        deterrence. While I believe our overall tactical approach to the Soviets has
                        been sound up to now, I feel strongly that—just as in the more limited
                            <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> area—we must devise a credible
                        two-track approach, combining a reasonable negotiating position linked to
                        overall Soviet restraint with a strong deterrent capacity. Weakness in
                        either of these tracks will tend in the long run to undermine our position
                        in the other, since both our own public and those of our allies will expect
                        us to offer alternatives to confrontation if their support is to be
                        forthcoming when confrontations are forced upon us. Conversely, of course,
                        our negotiating position would be weakened disasterously if we neglect our
                        deterrent capacity. Most of our attention up to now seems to have been
                        concentrated on rebuilding our capability for deterrence, and this is as it
                        should be. But I would hope that the Secretary will be in a position when he
                        confronts <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> to make clear that
                        either track is a viable option for the U.S. and it is up to the Soviets to
                        chose which they want.</p>
                    <p>13. One final note. As you are aware, in the past (save last year), <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> has usually met with the President
                        during his annual trip to the U.S. for the GA. I do not know whether the
                        question has come up with the Soviets in Washington, but on balance I can
                        see a distinct advantage in the President offering him a meeting. Such a
                        meeting would provide an opportunity for us to convey in the most
                        authoritative manner our current views and also should put to rest for some
                            <pb n="250" facs="0281" xml:id="pg_250"/>time the propaganda
                        effectiveness of Soviet complaints about the alleged U.S. unwillingness to
                        enter into a real dialogue and negotiate differences.</p>

                  </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>As you know, I will be meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> in New York September 23 and 28, during his visit
                        for the fall session of the U.N. General Assembly.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Objectives and Basic Approach</p>
                    <p>I see those talks as a potential contribution to your objective of putting
                        the US-Soviet relationship on a sounder footing by linking improved
                        bilateral relations with increased Soviet restraint. I will put this right
                        up front in an initial one-on-one session before the Delegations convene: I
                        would like in that session to convey on your behalf that we want to work
                        within a long-term perspective based on respect for each other’s vital
                        interests, but that this will frankly require new Soviet realism, together
                        with a recognition that the world power balance cannot be changed by
                        violence and force without calling forth a response in kind.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> will of course resist, and any
                        results will be neither large nor immediate, but we may be able to start a
                        process headed in the right direction. My main purpose will be to drive home
                        to him that our whole approach to East-West policy has fundamentally and
                        durably changed: from now on, the Soviet military build-up and lack of
                        international restraint will be met with an appropriate U.S. military and
                        political response. But I also want to convey to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that there is something for the Soviets in a more
                        moderate course.</p>
                    <pb n="251" facs="0282" xml:id="pg_251"/>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> is an accurate reporter, and I
                        will be making a sober presentation intended to show the Politburo that we
                        have adopted our new course deliberately and will pursue it deliberately;
                        that there are positive benefits if they adjust to it responsibly; and that
                        the process of serious dialogue we are ready for can produce an altogether
                        more solid and durable basis for conducting business and living together
                        than the two superpowers have ever had before.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Focus on Interventionism</p>
                    <p>I plan to deliver this message by hitting hard on Soviet and proxy
                        interventionism in crisis and potential crisis areas: Southeast Asia,
                        Afghanistan, Southern Africa and Central American/the Caribbean. I will also
                        highlight Poland and Iran as two countries where future Soviet intervention
                        would have disastrous effects. In this private meeting, the main accent will
                        be on the Cuban military build-up and Cuban activities abroad. I intend to
                        make clear to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that we are
                        prepared for improvement in US-Soviet relations, but that progress depends
                        on Soviet willingness to take our concerns into account. To reinforce this
                        argument, I plan to raise the possibility of another round of talks with him
                        some months hence, implicitly conditional on Moscow’s responsiveness to our
                        calls for restraint.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                  <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> Negotiations</p>
                    <p>The second main purpose of the meetings is to reach formal agreement on the
                        time and place for beginning <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>
                        negotiations later this year, in keeping with your commitment, and to
                        initiate substantive dialogue on <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>
                        issues. I will be making a strong pitch for Soviet cooperation in
                        international efforts to follow up on our evidence of toxin use in Southeast
                        Asia, and warn him of the impact on arms control prospects. But getting
                            <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> negotiations started is vital to
                        us, and it is an objective for the first meeting. The Soviets have been
                        sticky in discussions of the joint statement, and the topic may spill over
                        into the second. We should get the public statement we want that talks will
                        begin on November 30 in Geneva, but we will also be in a position to explain
                        to our friends that it is the Soviets, rather than us, who have been holding
                        back.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Possible Outcomes</p>
                    <p>I expect stiff rebuttals rather than explicit concessions on geopolitical
                        issues from <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. But it is
                        important to make our points again at the first Ministerial-level meeting
                        with the Soviets since you were elected, and to test Soviet responsiveness
                        at that level. The evidence will probably come back to us only over the next
                        several months.</p>
                    <p>It is also important to keep our dialogue before the public. This is the main
                        purpose of my suggesting another meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, <pb n="252" facs="0283" xml:id="pg_252"/>and I plan
                        to add one or two bilateral elements to the same end. I will raise a number
                        of outstanding human rights cases and have Ambassador-designate <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Art Hartman</persName> turn over another full list of
                        such cases. I will also raise the possibility of opening consulates in Kiev,
                        the heart of the Ukraine, and in New York. Again, results are less important
                        than making the point to the public that we are in fact communicating.</p>
                    <p>In addition, I am trying to reach interagency agreement on two economic
                        issues: approval of the $300 million International Harvester deal; and
                        closing of the Soviets’ Kama Purchasing Commission in the U.S. Informing
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> of these two steps—one
                        positive, one negative—will demonstrate that we have control over the
                        economic relationship.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> may hold to a total hard line
                        in these meetings, and we may well emerge with nothing more than agreement
                        to begin <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> and meet again at the foreign
                        minister level. Accordingly, we are keeping public and Allied expectations
                        low. Such a result, however, would not be a disaster: on the contrary, it
                        would keep the onus for delay and lack of good will on the Soviets, where it
                        belongs.</p>

                    <p>As you know, we have now embarked on a public campaign within the Alliance to
                        take the political offensive away from the Soviets. The purpose is to
                        demonstrate to Western publics that it is the Soviets, not the United
                        States, who are blocking the path to a more stable East-West relationship,
                        and that for our part we are ready for better relations if Moscow is ready
                        to show greater restraint.</p>
                    <p>To get this campaign off the ground, I believe that you should send a letter
                        to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> timed with the start of
                        the fall session of the U.N. General Assembly describing your views on the
                        future direction of US-Soviet relations. Although we would not release the
                        text of the <pb n="253" facs="0284" xml:id="pg_253"/>letter, we envisage
                        briefing the press on its main themes in order to create the maximum
                        possible impact on Western opinion.</p>
                    <p>The proposed letter (attached) makes some of the same points that I plan to
                        use with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> in my talks next
                        week. The basic message is that the U.S. is prepared to defend its interests
                        by whatever means necessary, but that a more constructive relationship is
                        possible if the Soviets exercise restraint.</p>

                    <p>Dear President <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>:</p>
                    <p>As we begin the fall session of the United Nations General Assembly and
                        approach the meetings between our Foreign Ministers, I thought it would be
                        useful for me to describe to you some of my thoughts on the future direction
                        of U.S.-Soviet relations.</p>
                    <p>Let me say at the outset that the United States is vitally interested in the
                        peaceful resolution of international tensions and in a more constructive and
                        stable relationship with your country. We have repeatedly demonstrated our
                        willingness to settle disagreements by negotiations and to observe
                        scrupulously our international commitments.</p>
                    <p>I believe, however, that a great deal of the present tension in the world is
                        due to actions by the Soviet Government. As we and our Allies have
                        repeatedly stated, two aspects of Soviet behavior are of particular concern
                        to us:</p>
                    <p>—First, the Soviet Union’s pursuit of unilateral advantage in various parts
                        of the globe and its repeated resort to the direct and indirect use of force
                        in regional conflicts. The role of Cuba in Africa and Latin America is
                        particularly disturbing and unacceptable to us.</p>
                    <pb n="254" facs="0285" xml:id="pg_254"/>
                    <p>—Second, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s unremitting and
                        comprehensive military buildup over the past 15 years, a buildup which in
                        our view far exceeds purely defensive requirements and carries disturbing
                        implications of a search for military superiority.</p>
                    <p>Despite these trends, we are committed to a dialogue with the Soviet Union.
                        We are deeply concerned over the threat to mankind in the age of nuclear
                        weapons. I have stated publicly that the United States is ready to engage in
                        discussions with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> that would lead
                        to genuine arms reductions. The existing stockpiles of these weapons and
                        ongoing programs are such that only a serious effort at arms reductions
                        would contribute to the objective which we both share, namely, lifting the
                        threat of nuclear annihilation which hangs over mankind.</p>
                    <p>While the United States is committed to a stable and peaceful world, it will
                        never accept a position of strategic disadvantage. Because the Soviet Union
                        has, over the past years, embarked on a major program to improve its
                        strategic forces, the United States must also upgrade its forces. We have no
                        desire to tax our societies with a costly, burdensome, and dangerous
                        build-up of armaments. The United States, however, will invest whatever is
                        needed to maintain a secure strategic posture.</p>
                    <p>The meetings this month between our Foreign Ministers will, I assume, set the
                        time and place for negotiations between our two countries on what we term
                        “theater nuclear forces.” We are deeply committed to achieving a military
                        balance in this area—a balance which has been upset by the unprecedented
                        buildup of military forces by your country in recent years, especially the
                        deployment of the SS–20 missiles. Furthermore, as we have stated at the
                        Madrid meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, we
                        are prepared to participate in negotiations to fashion a coherent system of
                        commitments on European security that are verifiable and militarily
                        significant.</p>
                    <p>With our Allies and other concerned nations, the United States is willing to
                        pursue negotiated solutions to the problems that threaten world peace,
                        including the presence of occupation forces in Afghanistan and Kampuchea.
                        Soviet readiness to resolve the Afghanistan problem on the basis of a prompt
                        withdrawal would go far toward restoring the international confidence and
                        trust necessary for the improvement of East-West relations. The Vietnamese
                        invasion and occupation of Kampuchea has earned widespread condemnation from
                        the international community as a breach of accepted norms of conduct and a
                        threat to peace. I call on your government to exert its influence over the
                        Government of Vietnam to withdraw its troops from Kampuchea.</p>
                    <p>In sum, the United States is more interested in actions which further the
                        cause of world peace than in words. We are fully committed to solving
                        outstanding differences by peaceful means, but we are not willing to accept
                        double standards of international behavior. Words <pb n="255" facs="0286" xml:id="pg_255"/>and public statements are, however, important. A major
                        contribution to the reduction of world tensions would be for your country to
                        curb the escalating campaign of anti-Americanism and disinformation both
                        inside the Soviet Union and abroad, a campaign which only serves to poison
                        the political atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, my country stands ready to begin the search for a better
                        U.S.-Soviet relationship. We are prepared to discuss with the Soviet Union
                        the full range of issues which divide us, to seek significant, verifiable
                        reductions in nuclear weapons, to expand trade, and to increase contacts at
                        all levels of our societies. I am hopeful that the meetings between
                        Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> and Foreign
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> will start a process
                        leading toward such a relationship.</p>
                    <p>For such a process to bear fruit, your country must understand the need for
                        greater restraint in the international arena. At the same time, let me add
                        that the United States is fully prepared to take your interests into
                        account, if you are prepared to do the same with ours. If we can succeed in
                        establishing a framework of mutual respect for each other’s interests and
                        mutual restraint in the resolution of international crises, I think we will
                        have created a much more solid and enduring basis for U.S.-Soviet relations
                        than we have ever had before.</p>

                        some heart problems. His wife tells us that he had never had such problems
                        before and they are probably the result of his having spent nine months in

                        questions, initially without going into detail. What were the Secretary’s
                        preferences on that score?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary, recalling previous meetings during the early period of the
                        Nixon Presidency, expressed the view that it would be well for us to have
                        some frank discussions without extensive notetaking. He would expect his
                        comments to be in support of US positions, whereas <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s comments would be in support of
                        Soviet positions. He thought that this kind of discussion was clearly in
                        order. In line with previous tradition, he would welcome any comment
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wished to make in this
                        setting. The Secretary intended to do the same and, if necessary, was
                        prepared to devote much time to such a discussion. This would not disturb
                        him because he had discussed this meeting <pb n="258" facs="0289" xml:id="pg_258"/>extensively with President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>, whereas his colleagues did not have the benefit of
                        such discussion.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to say that it would be
                        useful to discuss Soviet-U.S. relations as such in terms of principle. He
                        thought that to begin with it would be useful to touch on the question of
                        where, in the Secretary’s view, the U.S. and the Soviet Union should be
                        moving with regard to Soviet-U.S. relations, and how the Secretary envisaged
                        this direction. Above all, of course, the Soviet side wanted to understand
                        what the U.S. Administration’s intentions were with regard to Soviet-U.S.
                        relations for the foreseeable future. Did the U.S. expect these relations to
                        develop under the existing momentum? Of course, given the current state of
                        our relations, the Secretary would recognize what retention of the current
                        momentum would mean. Perhaps the Secretary believed, like the Soviet side,
                        that something different was needed on a reliable foundation, consistent
                        with the interests of the Soviet Union and of the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> believed that the conversation
                        should be pursued in these terms.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that he would be very happy to deal with this matter
                        because he believed that we were currently at an important junction. He did
                        not expect that during the discussion of this subject he would convince
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> or that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would convince him. But he thought
                        it important for us to communicate on the issues <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had touched upon. For his part, the Secretary wanted
                        to go back a bit in time so as to have the proper background and
                        appreciation, at least from the U.S. standpoint, of what had led to the
                        unsatisfactory state in which we found ourselves. But since <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was the guest, he wanted to hear
                        the latter’s comments on this matter of principle.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> suggested that it would be
                        appropriate not to go too far back into history because history could
                        provide very rich material. He thought that it would suffice to provide a
                        few examples in order to emphasize the basis on which the relations between
                        the two countries had developed. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> intended to do so now. Over a number of years, and
                        this would not be news to the Secretary, the two sides had exerted no mean
                        effort—in fact, they had exerted major efforts—toward improving relations
                        between the two countries, and toward establishing them upon firmer ground.
                        Thus, the two sides should do everything in their power to retain what had
                        been accomplished, in order not to lose it. Indeed, the two sides had
                        achieved much over the years. They had arrived at numerous agreements and
                        had concluded several treaties which, one could say, still smelled of the
                        sweat of the participants. This was a major step toward development of
                        Soviet-U.S. relations. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> went
                        on to say that suddenly—he wanted to emphasize, suddenly—there was a new
                        administration which told its people and the entire world that much of what
                        had been achieved did not suit it. <pb n="259" facs="0290" xml:id="pg_259"/>Moreover, frequently it did not even announce or provide rationale or
                        justification for its contention that some accord or other did not suit it.
                        This pertained specifically to the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II
                        Treaty and to some other agreements which either ground to a halt or on
                        which the administration cast a shadow trying to undermine their
                        adoption.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to say further with
                        respect to the overall mood in the U.S., among U.S. leading circles and in
                        the U.S. capital, that an atmosphere was being established on a daily basis
                        which did not facilitate accommodation or compromise. On the contrary, this
                        atmosphere was contributing to a very deep gulf, not only in political
                        terms, but in psychological terms as well. It was being emphasized that
                        these were not only two different countries, but that they constituted
                        different worlds. The Soviet side had taken note of this from the very first
                        days of the new administration as it was observing the new administration
                        but, to repeat, this point had been noted from the very first days. The
                        Soviet side had noted that statements were being made from the very first
                        days of the new administration to the effect that Soviet-U.S. relations
                        might not constitute the major issue, that they might not be the most
                        important issue, that they might not even be an important issue at all, and
                        this led to certain conclusions. Observing this the Soviet side shrugged its
                        shoulders and asked, why? After all, whatever statements are being made in
                        Moscow, London or elsewhere regarding the importance of relations with the
                        Soviet Union, they do not demean the worth of a country or the respect for
                        that country. This applied to the Soviet Union as much as it applied to the
                        United States; the respect in which a country was held would neither
                        increase nor diminish from this. Why was this being done? The Soviet Union
                        existed quite irrespective of the will of the United States, and the U.S.
                        existed irrespective of the will of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Accordingly, it was necessary to accept the real
                        situation and to assess the status of individual states on the basis of
                        objective reality. Their importance, their place in the world was governed
                        by objective reality. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> thought
                        that the Secretary could not but understand all this. Thus, the Soviet side
                        had reached the conclusion that the U.S. was aware of the above but
                        evidently had decided that there was a need to create an atmosphere in the
                        U.S. so the people of the country would not exaggerate the importance of
                        Soviet-U.S. relations, in fact, would belittle them.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> went on to say that the Soviet
                        Union considered this to be wrong because this did not reflect the desires
                        of the people and did not meet the interests of the U.S. people or the
                        Soviet people. Given the above, what was the purpose of confusing the
                        American population? We represented two powers, the major powers,
                        specifically in the military sense, especially in the military sense. Thus,
                        it was certainly of special importance to regulate the relations between
                        these two states, <pb n="260" facs="0291" xml:id="pg_260"/>to improve their
                        relations, especially in the military sense. There was no reason for the
                        people to think otherwise. If the above was true, why should we not improve
                        our relations on a more realistic and solid footing? <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> didn’t want the Secretary to think
                        that he was asking favors of the U.S. The importance of Soviet-U.S.
                        relations should be enhanced; this was in the interests of the U.S. people.
                        It was necessary to plant one’s feet firmly on the ground of reality.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was proceeding from
                        existing facts. Whatever the U.S. position, the Soviet side was proceeding
                        from real facts. The Secretary was no doubt familiar with the materials of
                        the 26th Congress of the <gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss> and with the
                        report presented by General Secretary of the <gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">L.I. Brezhnev</persName> regarding the policy of
                        the Soviet Union.<note n="2" xml:id="d88fn2">

                            (Moscow: Novosti Press Agency Publishing House, 1981)</note>
                        Accordingly, the Secretary would understand that the Soviet Union wanted to
                        develop relations with the U.S. on a realistic basis, that is,
                        good-neighborly, normal, and businesslike relations. The fact that we had
                        different social systems was an objective reality and nothing could be done
                        about that. But whatever differences or conflicts might arise, we should try
                        to resolve them by peaceful means, through negotiations. That was the Soviet
                        position.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> continued by saying that he
                        could not agree to an approach under which whenever a difference arose, one
                        immediately grabbed for a pistol or revolver, or even reached for the button
                        of a missile. The Soviet Union believed that no country in the world should
                        be able to say that it would press the button of war if something didn’t
                        suit it. In his view, serious statesmen did not have the liberty in such
                        cases to talk of the possibility of war, of the possibility of a nuclear
                        war. In fact, some individuals even thought that two wars were not enough,
                        they spoke of two and one half wars. Why was this being done? Although this
                        was a serious question, sometimes such questions nevertheless could not but
                        produce a smile. Why were officials in high positions doing this? Was it
                        because they wanted to appear brave in the eyes of others? But this need for
                        bravery should be channeled toward cooperation, toward seeking
                        accommodations. It was not appropriate for an official representing a major
                        power to pull a saber out of the scabbard. The Soviet side wanted not an
                        emotional basis, but a more solid basis of relations as was appropriate for
                        statesmen of the major powers. On behalf of the Soviet government he wanted
                        to say that this was the standpoint to which it adhered. In this connection
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> recalled that during
                        President Nixon’s first visit to Moscow, the latter had told <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> that the sides had sufficient
                        weapons to <pb n="261" facs="0292" xml:id="pg_261"/>destroy each other seven
                        times. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had replied that he
                        was aware of the figures and the two had agreed that there was no need to
                        destroy each other seven times, that the sides should search for ways to
                        reduce these numbers, that both sides should engage in this search.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> also wanted to say the
                        following which was very important in terms of obtaining a complete picture.
                        A number of U.S. officials in Washington had been saying that in certain
                        areas, such as Asia and Africa, things were not to the liking of the U.S.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> added that he was
                        intentionally refraining from citing names. In the U.S. things seemed to be
                        programmed in advance toward searching for the hand of Moscow by way of
                        conspirator, inciter, or at least, instigator of everything that did not
                        suit the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to say
                        that the Soviet Union could not be held responsible for everything that
                        displeased the U.S. There were objective processes. They had existed in the
                        past, they existed at present and would exist in the future, and they
                        governed occurrences in the world. Could it be said that what had happened
                        in <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s country in 1917 had been
                        produced by some individual? This was a product of objective history. Things
                        of this nature were bound to occur in the future as well, and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not believe that this would be
                        the fault of the Soviet Union. He suggested that perhaps there was some
                        misunderstanding on this score. If that was the case, it might be advisable
                        to climb a high tower and take a look at the world in more realistic terms.
                        Of course, if the U.S. recognized that things were not so, if they were
                        being distorted intentionally . . . (<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not complete the sentence). Perhaps the U.S.
                        truly believed that independence would not benefit Southern Africa, for
                        example, Angola, and that the situation in the Middle East was the fault of
                        the Soviet Union, that the situation in Southeast Asia was the fault of the
                        Soviet Union, and that the situation in Latin America was the fault of the
                        Soviet Union. But that was a gross misunderstanding. On the other hand, if
                        this was an act, the Secretary would know that the Soviet Union was not the
                        mother of history. It was a different matter, of course, if this was the
                        picture the U.S. administration wanted to project to the people. In
                        conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to express
                        hope for an improvement in the relations between the two countries.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> hoped that the Secretary would
                        understand that the Soviet Union by right occupied a worthy and legitimate
                        place in the world, that it had its own interests, including security
                        interests. The Soviet Union, for its part, recognized that the U.S. occupied
                        a worthy and legitimate place in the world and that it, too, had security
                        interests. He noted that we would yet have occasion to return to security
                        interests and thus he did not want to continue that theme at present. The
                        question now was how to establish a more solid foundation for our relations,
                        how emotionalism could be replaced by a more sober assessment. <pb n="262" facs="0293" xml:id="pg_262"/>Perhaps there was some outside influence?
                        Perhaps not all aspects were clear? There had been a time when we had much
                        in common, particularly during World War II when we had a high degree of
                        cooperation, especially in the military area, when we were jointly shedding
                        our blood. Perhaps some individuals were not clear about one thing or other.
                        In that case, we had to remove such doubts. It was necessary to clear up
                        misconceptions and misunderstandings, and get on with the dialogue. The
                        Secretary would recognize that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had not come here for the express purpose of
                        disagreeing, although, of course, he could do that. He had come here in
                        order to learn U.S. intentions, in order to learn the position of the U.S.
                        regarding major world issues and in order to convince the Secretary that the
                        Soviet Union was for safeguarding its legitimate interests. The U.S. side
                        could repeat a thousand times that there allegedly was a Soviet threat.
                        There was no treacherous plan, the Soviet Union did not need conquests. The
                        Soviet Union wanted to live in peace and it wanted the U.S. to live in
                        peace. Whenever the U.S. side was scaring the U.S. people and others, the
                        Soviet Union could not but explain its own view of the situation. It had
                        done so before and would continue in the future. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> asked rhetorically whether this constituted polemics
                        and answered in the affirmative. He went on to say that it was not the
                        Soviet side which had initiated this process, one of action and reaction.
                        The Soviet Union had not desired it, it had been forced into it. While both
                        sides might be engaged in it, it was not the Soviet Union which had started
                        the process. Accordingly, the Soviet side was very interested in knowing how
                        the U.S. intended to conduct its affairs with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in the future.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> went on to say that he had no
                        intention of raising one thorny question after another simply to place the
                        Secretary in an uncomfortable position. He wanted to discuss issues in a
                        business-like atmosphere. He was looking forward to business-like
                        discussions with the Secretary with a view to understanding each other’s
                        positions, as befitted the representatives of major world powers. He wanted
                        the U.S. to recognize the legitimate interests of the Soviet Union in the
                        world and not to infringe on them, just as the Soviet Union intended to
                        recognize and respect the legitimate interests of the U.S. The Soviet Union
                        did not pursue a goal of infringing on the legitimate interests of the U.S.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that as far as
                        the military area was concerned, we would have occasion to discuss it
                        specifically. Much could be said on that score, perhaps in conjunction with
                        some political questions. If he could use the expression, his comments
                        constituted algebra.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary responded that he was impressed by the serious tone and general
                        expression which <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and his
                        government had attached to subjects that were of extreme importance.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had <pb n="263" facs="0294" xml:id="pg_263"/>referred to the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration, and the Secretary
                        felt it was important that we understand the points of departure of the U.S.
                        Administration. The Secretary knew that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had been a keen observer of the U.S. scene for many
                        years. Few public figures, if any, today have the experience and the
                        accomplishments of <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. In line
                        with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s reference to objective
                        reality, the Secretary felt it necessary to try and communicate to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> how we had arrived at the current
                        state of affairs, which we did not like. He was not doing so in order to
                        score debating points or to raise controversial issues, rather his purpose
                        was to approach the current problems we faced as a backdrop to how we would
                        like to proceed in the future.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would know that early in the
                        seventies—and the Secretary had noted <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s mention of President Nixon’s comments about <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>—he sometimes telephoned from Washington
                        to the President in Moscow following individual meetings. In a number of
                        respects, achievements were made at that time, involving the sweat of people
                        working together. While the term “detente” had not been coined at that time,
                        it had come into special international prominence. At that time, the
                        Secretary had helped in Washington with the preparation of the document on
                        principles that both sides negotiated. It was suggested in this document
                        that neither side was to gain an advantage, whether directly or indirectly.
                        At that time historic events had converged on the U.S., events which were
                        not necessarily the result of an outside hand or evil design, but which
                        constituted historic reality, namely, Vietnam and Watergate.</p>
                    <p>It was not during the <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>
                        Administration, but during the Ford Administration, that the American people
                        began to witness a number of events which made a profound impression on the
                        U.S. mood and attitude regarding U.S.-Soviet relations. The Secretary wanted
                        to speak very frankly. First, there was the invasion in Angola. No one can
                        objectively insist that the Soviet Union inspired this invasion, but neither
                        can anyone deny that it was made possible by material assistance.</p>
                    <p>The next several events involved Ethiopia, Kampuchea and Southern Yemen, the
                        first situation in Afghanistan and the second situation in Afghanistan.
                        There was clear evidence from the U.S. standpoint of a growing and more
                        active Cuban activity here. In the wake of the Cuban crisis, during the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KRT_1">Kennedy</persName> Administration, some
                        progress had been made to blunt Cuban activities for a while. But then they
                        rose again to the point where some 40,000 Cuban combat forces currently are
                        in Africa.</p>
                    <p>All of this left a very serious impression in the U.S. perception of
                        U.S.-Soviet relations, and affected what had been high hopes during the
                        early days of detente. At that time some success had been made with regard
                        to trade and arms control. That was in 1975, before the <pb n="264" facs="0295" xml:id="pg_264"/>
                  <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> period. President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> was voted into office because he had articulated for
                        the American people concerns which showed the absence of reciprocity in
                        detente. Soviet policy, for whatever reason, had become a one-way street.
                        Compared to the level of 1975, today we see a Soviet presence in areas of
                        interest to the U.S. and the West, at levels that constitute a potential
                        threat to the West, which is unprecedented in Africa, Afghanistan and the
                        Western Hemisphere. This was resuming again. We have spoken of the high
                        levels of military equipment provided to Cuba. All this pertains to the
                        agreement worked out with the sweat of the bureaucrats and officials of both
                        countries. But the question arises of whether it is being abided by.</p>
                    <p>We are even refused answers to questions. The Secretary pointed to Sverdlovsk
                        and to the question last month regarding the use of mycotoxins in
                        Afghanistan, Laos and Kampuchea for which we had hard, irrefutable evidence
                        that we will transmit next week through our arms control

                                alia</hi>, that “The United States has strong reason to believe that

                            Convention.” The démarche cited the incident at Sverdlovsk, and linked
                            the Soviet Union to “attacks with lethal agents” in Afghanistan, Laos,
                            and Kampuchea. (Telegram 263576 to Moscow, October 1; Department of
                            State, Central Foreign Policy File, D810464–0793)</note> All this was
                        continuing and thus raising questions in the minds of the American people.
                        This did not start with the current Administration. The current
                        Administration would not have been elected without it. The Administration
                        reflected this growing American mood.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary expressed the view that our discussions could focus on three
                        areas. First, there was the geopolitical area, that is, strategic crisis
                        areas in the world. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had
                        discussed the second area, namely the military balance and our goals thereon
                        in the U.S. In this connection the two sides had conflicting priorities. It
                        was not the President’s desire to return to an arms buildup, but there was a
                        need to understand the objective situations. The third area concerned
                        bilateral relations which, as we see it, derive from our understanding with
                        respect to the first two areas.</p>
                    <p>During this preliminary discussion the Secretary did not want to leave
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> with the impression that
                        U.S.-Soviet relations were not important to us. We had been accused of a
                        fixation on these relations. One should have neither. It had to be
                        understood that even reasonably historic events could affect better
                        relations and distort them, whatever the objective criterion. It was a
                        simple fact that the Soviet Government encouraged nations, specifically Cuba
                        and Libya, to engage in activities <pb n="265" facs="0296" xml:id="pg_265"/>which, perhaps not at the sufferance of Moscow, still could not be
                        maintained without the material resources of Moscow. Therefore, the
                        Secretary wanted to emphasize in all sincerity that President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> did not wish a situation of sterile
                        confrontation and an absence of communications between our two governments
                        and peoples. Just the opposite was true. The Secretary thought it essential
                        to move forward toward better communications and towards dealing with
                        matters in which, quite frankly, we Americans considered ourselves to be the
                        aggrieved party. There was a need for a concrete and specific improvement,
                        and consequently for a dialogue together. This would not occur
                        overnight.</p>
                    <p>In our view our relationship had to be a superpower relationship. The
                        Secretary was not asking the Soviet Union to be humiliated by veering from
                        its courses, for example in Afghanistan where, for whatever reason, the
                        Soviet side was engaged. We were seeking an honorable, not a humiliating
                        solution. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would recall that
                        in the late 60s and early 70s we had an experience comparable to the
                        Kampuchea situation, though not parallel to it. We understood what had
                        happened. We did not believe that Hanoi was able to do what it was doing
                        without Soviet support. On the other hand, we did not believe that the
                        Soviet Union made Hanoi’s decisions. We were all conscious of what was
                        happening and the Secretary wanted to say that he was not pleased by it.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the reference in <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                            <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> speech to Poland,<note n="4" xml:id="d88fn4">See Bernard Nossiter, “<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> at U.N. Says U.S. Fosters a New Arms Race;

                            23, 1981, p. A1.</note> the Secretary said that as a witness together
                        with the Europeans, and in his present capacity, he would note that the West
                        was acting with extreme restraint. We had helped to relieve the economic and
                        the commodity needs of the Polish people. The Secretary pointed to the
                        particular danger of outside interference. This was an objective reality. It
                        could profoundly impact on everything we were talking about. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would recognize, of course, that we
                        were not going to exploit (though we could) or exacerbate the situation. We
                        were scrupulously trying to avoid this. Turning to the area of arms control,
                        the Secretary noted that this would require good will. While this was not
                        its “raison d’etre,” our objective was to try seriously for a break-through.
                        This would be in our mutual interest. If this was not to be, the Secretary
                        was prepared to accept it. He hoped <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> understood that what he saw in Washington was a
                        reflection of the new U.S. concern because for a number of years there has
                        been a lack of reciprocity. Now we have to walk the <gloss target="#t_CAT_1">cat</gloss> back. It was not our objective to humiliate the Soviet <pb n="266" facs="0297" xml:id="pg_266"/>side, but realistically, as
                        superpowers, we had to take into account each other’s legitimate
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>The record of the past years does not show a balanced relationship. Indeed,
                        we wanted to move forward. This was our goal, the goal of President
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>. The Secretary proposed,
                        and we could do as <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> preferred,
                        that in a superpower to superpower relationship we leave behind classic
                        rhetoric and speak about some specific areas. Much time could be devoted to
                        a more beneficial and restrained relationship.</p>
                    <p>As he understood the Soviet standpoint, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had raised concerns about what he viewed as simple
                        American rhetoric. The Secretary wanted to note that this rhetoric was not
                        new. As for personalities, their mention had been scrupulously avoided. He
                        pointed out that the Soviet side had been referring to “imperialism” and
                        “colonialism” in its organs and we could not tolerate this further without a
                        U.S. response. There has been no reciprocity; there has been no sound basis.
                        We would like all of this to stop. We thought it could stop. The Secretary
                        was saying this quite frankly. He hoped that we could deal with objective
                        reality without infringing upon vital Soviet interests or U.S. interests,
                        and without stagnating in a confrontational, sterile mode. There must be a
                        basis of reciprocity. If the Soviet side had legitimate problems, we would
                        try to improve, remove or modify them.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that he had said much in this short period of time,
                        having mentioned some specifics. He thought that we could continue by
                        region, or he could be more specific. At this time the Secretary was
                        prepared to discuss some military considerations or some bilateral issues.
                        Perhaps <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> preferred to leave
                        these questions for the September 28 meeting. The Secretary was also
                        prepared for the <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> discussion—that is,
                        when and where they would be held and the name of our representative. As he
                        understood it, our experts had exchanged drafts on this question. Perhaps
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> preferred to do this now,
                        perhaps he preferred to wait until September 28, or perhaps he preferred to
                        defer it beyond that date. The Secretary wanted <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> to understand that we were in favor of a more
                        constructive approach. The Secretary noted again that this was just an
                        initial exchange and hoped that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> understood our intentions and our goals.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to respond to one or
                        two points. First, he wanted to ask a question. Did the Secretary recognize
                        the right of the Soviet Union to render assistance and help through the
                        delivery of small quantities of weapons specifically intended for
                        self-defense? After all, the U.S. was doing this with respect to a much
                        larger number of countries than the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.
                        He asked for the Secretary’s reply, after which he would have something to
                        add. To repeat the question, did the U.S. recognize in principle the right
                        of the Soviet Union to do so, or did it reserve that right exclusively for
                        itself?</p>
                    <pb n="267" facs="0298" xml:id="pg_267"/>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that in principle we had no objections to the support
                        of historic friends and to assistance intended for defense against an
                        external threat. We had a legitimate objection if this occurred in a
                        sensitive area, or if such supplies were for use elsewhere and intended to
                        upset the status quo in the face of legal international norms and contrary
                        to the rule of law.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> responded that in other words
                        the Secretary recognized that right, and could not have done otherwise,
                        because the U.S. was providing supplies to a large number of countries, not
                        to mention the U.S. military bases and the military equipment stored there.
                        He was troubled by the question of sensitive areas. Was this to mean that no
                        changes could occur, not even in a million years? The Soviet Union was
                        rendering such assistance when requested, under agreements strictly defining
                        their defensive nature. In contrast to the U.S., no nation receiving Soviet
                        military assistance had Soviet military forces. And how many such forces did
                        the U.S. have? <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was tempted to
                        cite the number, but preferred not to do so at this time. He noted that the
                        two Germanies were a special case, resulting from the wartime situation. The
                        Secretary would know that the Soviet Union was not doing this to encroach
                        upon, or to make inroads on U.S. interests. Absolutely not.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union could not see what U.S. interests there were in Angola, or
                        in Ethiopia. To take the Secretary’s formula, Pakistan would pose a problem.
                        When did history record Pakistan as being within the U.S. sphere? This was a
                        slippery path. Such Soviet assistance was not aimed at the U.S. None of
                        these countries posed a threat to the U.S. and certainly not those countries
                        with which the U.S. has good relations. The Soviet Union was doing nothing
                        to threaten the U.S. Of course, someone like Sadat might do anything. His
                        policies were a greater riddle than the most ancient Egyptian pyramids. He
                        could improvise “hell knows what.”</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> asked, was it
                        true, as reported in the press, that the U.S. had reached an agreement with
                        Sadat concerning purchase of Soviet weapons for delivery to Afghan
                        insurgents who were being infiltrated from Pakistan?<note n="5" xml:id="d88fn5">See, for example, “Sadat Says U.S. Buys Soviet Arms in
                            Egypt for Afghan Rebels,” <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>,
                            September 23, 1981, p. A15.</note> If this was true, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> could only express amazement. Was
                        it possible that the U.S. could do something like this? That would be
                        unworthy of the U.S. He thought that a serious country with a serious
                        foreign policy could not act this way.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> went on to say that no country
                        receiving Soviet military assistance posed a threat to the U.S. or its
                        allies. Moreover, there were not all that many such countries. The Secretary
                        had mentioned Angola <pb n="268" facs="0299" xml:id="pg_268"/>and Cuba. For
                        one thing, Cuba was not the Soviet Union. Secondly, it was a sovereign
                        country and, third, the assistance was strictly of a defensive nature. Since
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had already dealt with
                        this question in his <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> speech, he did not
                        wish to belabor the matter of Cuba at this time. The Soviet Union realized
                        that the U.S. disliked Cuba. The reason for this was the Cuban social
                        system.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> went on to say that if the
                        U.S. were to get South Africa to leave Angola alone—and the U.S. could do
                        this—this would provide a solution fully in accord with the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter and the resolutions regarding
                        liberation of colonial nations and peoples. If the U.S. were to “put South
                        Africa in its place” and Namibia gained independence, then there would be no
                        problem. The problem of Cuba would disappear. Everything could be
                        regulated.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that he would yet have
                        occasion to refer to the problem of Afghanistan, but the Secretary had
                        already referred to it and had expressed an interest in the Soviet troops
                        there. These troops will be withdrawn, but first, incursions from Pakistan
                        into Afghanistan had to cease. If the U.S. was truly interested in seeing
                        Afghanistan without Soviet troops, if it was genuinely interested in a
                        neutral and non-aligned Afghanistan, this could be done by working out a
                        relevant document with the participation of Afghanistan and Pakistan. This
                        document could bear the U.S. signature and the Soviet signature. What was
                        required was removal of the interventionist forces. That would be the end of
                        that matter. The Secretary might see a paradox here, but this was a case
                        where the paradox was equated to reality. The U.S. was engaged in actions
                        that kept Soviet troops in Afghanistan. The Soviet Union wanted to withdraw
                        its troops, but the U.S. was not giving it an opportunity to do so.
                        Accordingly, they remained there, and if the intervention continued would
                        remain there.</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, these bands did not constitute a military force that Soviet
                        troops had to contend with. These were groups of terrorists supplied in
                        Pakistan, specifically by the U.S.—and the U.S. had said so on a high
                        level—and by China. Thus, here was a paradox: it was the U.S. which was
                        keeping the Soviet forces in Afghanistan. Since the Soviet troops have to
                        stay in Afghanistan, the Soviet Union had to take care of them and ensure
                        their well being. Perhaps there was no political solution with regard to
                        Afghanistan, Pakistan and the U.S.’ friend, Iran; the Secretary would
                        understand in what sense <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        meant this. As for the matter of personalities, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would try not to owe a debt to the Secretary, but he
                        preferred to stay away from polemics.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that regarding U.S.
                        policy with respect to the Soviet Union, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had noted the U.S. tone in which the Soviet Union
                        was being accused of posing various threats. One would think that the Soviet
                        Union was devoting day and night to devising threats to the <pb n="269" facs="0300" xml:id="pg_269"/>U.S. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to propose an experiment. If the U.S., for
                        its part, were to cease all hostile unfriendly statements and propaganda
                        against the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union would immediately stop its
                        statements. Thus, everything depended on the U.S. After all, the mass media
                        reflected the position of a country. The Soviet Union could be more
                        moderate, or it could be more active.</p>
                    <p>As for the U.S., it had developed such a pace that even if it tried to stop
                        fast it would probably find it difficult to do so. Or did the U.S. have such
                        knights who could accomplish this? On second thought, though, the U.S.
                        probably would succeed. In short, what the Secretary saw in the Soviet mass
                        media was nothing but a response to American actions. Perhaps the U.S. side
                        saw the situation differently. But the fact was that when the two sides
                        engaged in public polemics, the Soviet side saw the situation differently.
                        In any event, this process did not originate on the Soviet side; this was
                        not simply a circle.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that this was all he had
                        to offer in the general discussion. As he had said, our discussion had been
                        a kind of algebra, i.e., the fundamentals. It dealt with the guidelines
                        toward moving foward. The Secretary had almost immediately referred to
                        specific reasons. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> thought
                        that rather than exacerbating our relationship we should work toward
                        preventing such exacerbations of the relationship. He noted that in dealing
                        merely with the specifics one could lose sight of the fundamental issues by
                        getting carried away with the details. The situation in the world was
                        complex. This was particularly true with regard to Africa and Asia. Without
                        an overall view, one could lose sight of the fundamental issues.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he did not disagree. He knew that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had participated in, and studied
                        history. According to the Hegelian dialectic which Marx had studied
                        astutely, every action led to a counter action. Allowing for the importance
                        of this discussion, we should never lose sight of what incited an action and
                        what generated a counter action. With regard to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s view about the level of assistance, the Secretary
                        wanted to say that current statistics showed the Soviet Union exporting arms
                        at a much higher level, at an unprecedented level. Thus, shipments to Cuba
                        were double what they had been previously. That generated a counter
                        action.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        evidently had misunderstood him. He did not believe in a rigidly-defined
                        status quo. This would be futile. He believed that changes should occur
                        peacefully, under the rule of law. He also noted that it would be hard to
                        argue that Western influence in Pakistan was not an historic reality. No one
                        in the U.S. was trying to re-establish old alliances, old security
                        frameworks, as they had existed at the end of World War II. But he believed
                        that much the same applied to the Soviet Union with respect to the
                        independence <pb n="270" facs="0301" xml:id="pg_270"/>and non-alignment of
                        Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Secretary emphasized that any overt action
                        against Pakistan was predicated precisely on that. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had spoken about forays from
                        Pakistan. The Secretary was surprised to hear this, he had been unaware of
                        them. Perhaps <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had other
                        information or evidence on that score. The Secretary did know of three
                        million Afghan refugees who had been forced out as a result of the Soviet
                        intervention, and who were in Pakistan and Iran. He had to say that he was
                        unaware of any cross-border activities which constituted a threat to, or
                        justified 80,000 plus Soviet forces. The simple fact was that Afghanistan
                        had been a neutral and non-aligned country leaning toward Moscow. No one in
                        the U.S. or the West had tried to change that. The Soviet Union had first
                        installed a puppet leader and had then intervened with Soviet forces.</p>
                    <p>As for <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s comments about Sadat,
                        the Secretary did not know the answer. He was not aware of the activities
                        mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. Sadat had been,
                        and continued to be a staunch friend of the Middle East Peace process. As
                        for what Sadat might have said publicly regarding arms, the Secretary would
                        have to study the matter, but for the moment he was unaware of the U.S.
                        Administration being engaged in it.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary had heard <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                        comment regarding his Cuban statement and had noted the unusual way in which
                        this question complemented treatment of Poland in <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> address. Perhaps he should study the matter further, but
                        he did not understand the significance of that juxtaposition. On Angola,
                        there was a great deal of evidence to suggest that Cuban forces in Angola
                        were not wanted. We had spoken of objective reality. We were very interested
                        in the resolution of the Namibian situation. We thought it was possible and
                        desirable. If the Soviet side had no designs in this region, then it was all
                        the more possible. If it did have designs then, of course, this would be
                        another paradox.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> interjected that the Soviet
                        Union had no such designs.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary continued that in that case he was confident that it would be
                        possible to achieve Namibian independence at an early stage. If that was the
                        case, this was one particular regional issue where we could start on the
                        long road back, and we could speak specifically about independent Namibia
                        very soon. This also involved the Cubans.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> retorted that this was a
                        matter of the chicken and the egg, that is, the matter of cause and
                        effect.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary suggested that both the chicken and the egg should be on the
                        same plate. He thought that given good will we could resolve the matter. As
                        for Afghanistan, the Secretary believed that this, also, should constitute
                        no basis of concern to Moscow, because we were not seeking any influence in
                        Afghanistan. But the reality was that even if <pb n="271" facs="0302" xml:id="pg_271"/>the present regime were withdrawn, a new neutral
                        Government had to have the support of the people in order to last.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that a neutral regime
                        and a neutral country were different things. The Soviet Union was in favor
                        of a neutral country, a non-aligned country. It was strongly in favor of
                        that. As for emigration, he was aware of a figure of two million, perhaps a
                        bit higher. He was not familiar with a figure of three million. The Afghan
                        Government was ready to accept these people back. He knew of a
                        recently-promulgated law that whoever came back would not be punished—in
                        fact would even be given assistance.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that in all fairness he did not believe that under
                        internationally acceptable circumstances with true self-determination this
                        regime could survive five minutes. If the Soviet side accepted
                        self-determination then there was no issue. But if the present regime were
                        to be retained as a facade, then the man would have his throat cut.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> responded that this would make
                        it all the easier for Pakistan to adopt effective measures and laws to seal
                        the border effectively in order to stop incursions. Once intervention
                        ceased, and this cessation was effectively guaranteed, Soviet troops would
                        leave Afghanistan. In this connection he wanted to note that the Soviet
                        Union did not throw words around lightly.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he was not familiar with what was coming across the
                        border. But there was evidence of Afghan actions against Pakistan. He was
                        keeping an open mind and was hoping for a solution. This situation was doing
                        considerable damage to U.S.-Soviet relations, to the Western world and to
                        the non-aligned world. He noted that the Islamic Conference was in the
                        forefront of those who had condemned Soviet actions in Afghanistan and this
                        without being prompted by the U.S. or other Western countries. The U.S. was
                        not interested in erecting obstacles. It sincerely wanted to help.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> suggested that the leaders of
                        Pakistan be “strongly advised” to cease the intervention by gangs organized
                        and trained on Pakistani territory. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that following a cessation of such
                        intervention, and given a stable border, Soviet troops would be withdrawn
                        and emigres would be free to return—without weapons of course—without fear
                        of punishment. If necessary, this could be recorded in an appropriate
                        document. In this connection he noted that the Government of Afghanistan had
                        recently made a public declaration regarding peaceful activities.<note n="6" xml:id="d88fn6">The precise statement to which <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> refers is unclear. On August
                            19, 1981, the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> reported progress
                            between the Governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan toward U.N.-brokered
                            negotiations for a broader peace settlement. (“Outlook Brighter for
                            Pakistani-Afghan Talks,” <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, August
                            19, 1981, p. A7)</note> And, if necessary, the Soviet Union was <pb n="272" facs="0303" xml:id="pg_272"/>prepared at any time to provide
                        friendly advice regarding possible further laws if it should prove advisable
                        to adopt them. Of course, this was an internal affair. He asked why what had
                        just been discussed was not acceptable. This matter was clear. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> accepted what the Secretary had
                        said on this score. Afghanistan should remain a neutral country. Hopefully
                        the Government will be friendly to the Soviet Union, but the latter did not
                        want anything special. The Soviet Union did not need its resources, it had
                        enough raw materials and a large enough population of its own. He suggested
                        that the Secretary give some thought to this. Perhaps there was an
                        extraneous factor here, something originating with Sadat. Or with Moslem
                        circles. They all regard the situation from their own perspectives, but we
                        ought to view it from a higher tower.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary wanted to suggest that we discuss the problem and see it in
                        terms of different interest groups. For our part, we support the ten nations
                        of the European Community and their proposal for a peaceful solution,
                        involving self-determination and withdrawal of Soviet forces.<note n="7" xml:id="d88fn7">The proposal is outlined in “Common Market Presses
                            Soviet on Afghanistan,” <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, September
                            7, 1981, p. A5.</note> If that needed to be fleshed out, we could
                        consider non-interference by third parties, with guaranteed rights for
                        refugees and a guaranteed formula for self-determination. He thought that if
                        this could be worked out, it would be acceptable. We did have an obligation
                        regarding some coordination with our Western European partners. He thought
                        that with good will we could find an acceptable solution for all interested
                        parties.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> suggested that some further
                        thought be given to this matter. He was pleased to see that the Secretary
                        understood the Soviet position. He repeated that there seemed to be some
                        extraneous matters, some narrow interests, some sort of Moslem interests in
                        and around Afghanistan. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        thought that sufficient time had been devoted to this question. Hopefully a
                        solution could be found, but it was not that promising. As for questions
                        involving weapons, specifically nuclear weapons in Europe, this matter was
                        crucial. In this connection he wondered whether the two ministers should
                        join the rest of the delegations.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we could do so if <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> felt it necessary. If <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wished, we could join the rest of the delegations at
                        the table and discuss the matter of medium-range missiles.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed to continue the meeting in the broader forum.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary said he and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had
                        discussed the whole broad range of principles, and some options for future
                        approaches. They were at the point where they could begin discussions on
                        armaments, and flesh out our views on medium-range weapons negotiations.
                        They could do this today or the 28th. He calculated they had about one and
                        one-half hours left.</p>

                        the press statement that the delegations will resume their work? If today,
                        then they should discuss it.</p>

                        people would think there was some kind of disruption in the bilateral

                        to the press today. The Secretary suggested that they then, on the 28th,
                        could focus on some of the specific aspects they had touched on today.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> agreed. In principle, he went
                        on, they could issue a statement that they had had an exchange of views, so
                        people would be clear that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and US
                        had agreed to begin talks this year. As he understood it, the two sides had
                        not been able to agree on a joint text. So unless they would make a
                        revolution to assure a joint text there would not be one. But it would be a
                        minor revolution.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he sensed a fertile opportunity for a revolutionary move
                        on the first day of our meeting. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said he therefore proposed that they agree in
                        principle, without looking at the text of the paper, to talks on the basis
                        of the principle of equality and equal security. Later, when talks begin,
                        they would seek an equivalent formula to reflect that principle. The
                        Secretary replied that this was in the spirit of bloodless revolution. We
                        could agree that there would be no preconditions.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said there was no
                        counterrevolution. Let us agree, he suggested, to say that negotiations will
                        begin and will be a continuation of the talks we had before, and that the
                        delegations will meet without preconditions. He had a little secret: during
                        the Geneva talks no substance was discussed; the two sides still had to go
                        the distance to substance.<note n="3" xml:id="d89fn3">A reference to
                            U.S.-Soviet negotiations on Theatre Nuclear Weapons held in Geneva from

                        to continuation, without characterization. This would not tie them down to
                        the previous administration, to any specifics whatsoever.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had just
                        put his finger on the sensitive issue we want to avoid: the commitments or
                        obligations incurred by the previous administration. Let them not mention
                        Geneva, he suggested. This was not a substantive issue, merely procedure.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> suggested the words:
                        “A continuation of talks held earlier between the two countries.”</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> rejoined that [if] they made
                        no mention of venue, they had to mention time. All things exist in time and
                        space. The Secretary said if they used just the terminology we had
                        suggested, people can interpret it as they wish. If we were to put in a time
                        limit, there would <pb n="275" facs="0306" xml:id="pg_275"/>be a certain
                        problem. Let them say “which for a certain period of time have been the
                        subject of discussion between the two sides.”</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> replied that we have discussed
                        so many things, so many various questions. If time and place were not
                        mentioned, it would sound like a riddle and would only attract attention.
                        The positions of the partners, after all, would not be mentioned. Positions
                        were one thing. We were only referring to the section of the negotiation
                        which had a certain time and place. The Secretary said he thought the Soviet
                        September 14 counter-proposal had an acceptable characterization of previous
                        discussion: “which have for a certain period of time been the subject of
                        discussion between the two sides.” This made clear that there were no
                        preconditions with respect to medium-range missiles. Some of this got into
                        matters we hoped will be part of the negotiations, to be determined.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> rejoined that he did not
                        understand our super-sensitivity on this point. Would the two sides at least
                        refer to October-November of 1980, if we cannot refer to Geneva? He asked if
                        we referred to neither, everything would be lost. His colleagues would ask
                        whether we were to discuss the origins of the universe.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> was not wedded in any way to the Geneva discussions.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would explain to his
                        colleagues what he had meant, and the Secretary would use the ambiguities to
                        explain that the reference was to the discussions the Ambassador and he have
                        had, as well as to previous discussions. These were peculiarities of the
                        American system. He was willing to come to some other aspects of the Soviet
                        draft. The Secretary suggested a further formula “exchange views regarding
                        arms limitation involving (invent a new term) intermediate range nuclear
                        systems which. . . .”</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said the Secretary seemed to
                        be working to be more specific. If he started in this paper to be more
                        specific, then specificity would also have to reflect the Soviet position,
                        for instance it should say “in the context of forward-based systems.” The
                        Soviets had wanted to avoid such specifics, and for that reason had
                        preferred a more general formula. They were moving closer to our position
                        than we were. They thought we should avoid positions. The Secretary said we
                        did not want to prejudge anything.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> suggested that the two sides
                        maybe should try to agree to drop any mention of Geneva, and just mention
                        October and November of 1980 and the various places our representatives had
                        discussions. After all, they had discussed these topics in London, in Paris,
                        in Washington, and, seriously, they had discussed it better in various
                        capitals.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that unfortunately there would still be the problem,
                        since the time would refer to the previous Administration’s discussions.</p>
                    <pb n="276" facs="0307" xml:id="pg_276"/>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said, OK, let them use
                        “problems that were discussed between representatives of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the US.” This would be unclarity on
                        top of unclarity. One could not go further into the twilight without being
                        in black night.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked what about saying “informally?” <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> insisted that they should not;
                        there was no such agreement. That would generate too many questions
                        regarding formal and informal talks. The Soviet side had not proposed
                        “official talks;” we should just say “discussed.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary responded that the discussion was getting so obscure that they
                        should say “discussed earlier in Geneva.” Let them say: “arms control
                        involving those nuclear arms which were discussed earlier in Geneva between
                        US and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> representatives.” They should
                        also say “initiate formal negotiations.”</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> rejoined that “formal” did not
                        mean anything in Russian. Let them use “serious;” that was the best way to
                        convey the thought “serious.” The Secretary asked why they should not say
                        “formal and serious?” <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> replied
                        “fine.” The U.S. would say “formal and serious,” the Soviet would say
                        “serious.” The Secretary repeated that they agree the Soviets say we will
                        hold “serious”—and the U.S. would say “formal”—on behalf of etc. The U.S.
                        would also be prepared to add the name of its chief negotiator, <persName corresp="#p_NPH_1">Paul Nitze</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said the Soviets would also add theirs: <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Yu. A. Kvitsinskiy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that he had suggestions for a revolution. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said the Soviets always knew it
                        would come. The Secretary replied that the process was dialectical.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> rejoined that dialectics
                        come from nature. The Secretary mentioned he was seeking the perfect
                        synthesis. In the last paragraph, he proposed they say we seek equal,
                        effective and verifiable outcomes at lowest levels. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said what the Soviets needed was a
                        reference to the principle of equality and equal security. On the figures we
                        would differ. We might need to draw up some kind of equation. For now, it
                        was the principle that was important.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary proposed “equal, effective and verifiable outcomes at the
                        lowest levels of forces on the basis of the principle of equality and equal
                        security.” <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> rejoined that in
                        that case everyone would inject their own meaning into these terms. On
                        verification, the U.S. would say, for example, that <gloss target="#t_NTM_1">NTM</gloss> were not enough, the Soviets say that they were enough. The
                        two sides should say “on the basis of the principle of equality and equal
                        security.” “Equal” itself could be taken to mean equality of numbers, where
                        there might be some inequalities on bombers, or on missiles, pluses and
                        minuses which add up to equality in the long run. That was why they should
                        go back to the principle.</p>
                    <pb n="277" facs="0308" xml:id="pg_277"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said that in the spirit of compromise he proposed to add
                        “verifiable” to the Soviet text. There was nothing objectionable about it.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> objected that it was a
                        subject for the negotiation. The Secretary said he found that hard to
                        understand. The U.S. needed something on verification. It had been a
                        consistent position for many years, and we had never differed on the
                        principle. The U.S. could not explain failure to mention the principle of
                        verification in a text on principles.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> replied that this certainly
                        complicated the matter. The Soviets were familiar with statements by U.S.
                        officials on verification. During the talks the U.S. could raise it, but why
                        start with polemics at the outset? The Secretary said he did not see it as
                        polemical. It was a key principle. The U.S. had not prejudged the
                        negotiations in mentioning it. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that it would not work. It introduced an
                        element of polemics that was out of place in this very first document. The
                        Secretary replied that if there was any mention of principles, he would have
                        to insist on verification.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> rejoined that without mention
                        of the principle of equality and equal security they would have to do
                        without a joint statement. Principles should not be to the detriment of
                        either side, and these were to the advantage of both, helped both. Indeed,
                        they were the only common principles. The President and the Secretary had
                        made many statements on equality in the situation of both sides. There had
                        been other statements too, but on the whole this principle had been
                        confirmed by this Administration. It was both the most acceptable and most
                        general formula. Mention of verification would not work. The Soviets had
                        gone far to accommodate the U.S. side.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary suggested elimination of the last paragraph, or abbreviation to
                        mentioning the principle of “equality.” “Both sides believe in the
                        importance of these negotiations for enhancing stability and international
                        security and pledged to spare no effort to reach an equitable outcome at the
                        lowest possible level.” This should not be contentious for either side.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that was altogether
                        different. It would not meet the requirements. Let’s do the following: (1)
                        They would say what the sides had agreed in the first paragraph, except that
                        the Soviets would add “in October and November of 1980.” (2) On the second
                        paragraph the sides had agreed. (3) On the third paragraph both sides would
                        say what they wanted. The Soviet side would say “on the basis of the
                        principle of equality and equal security,” the U.S. would say what it
                        wanted.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary objected that this would start them off in the midst of
                        controversy. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> agreed it would
                        be worse. The Secretary added that the argument would rage forever.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said he saw <pb n="278" facs="0309" xml:id="pg_278"/>no other way out. The Secretary said we had
                        accepted the essence of Soviet demands on the first paragraph; on the second
                        the two sides were agreed; on the third the Soviets did not even accept
                        mention of verifiability. He did not understand their objection to “an equal
                        outcome at lower levels.”</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> replied it was not necessary
                        to mention lower levels in this first statement. They were basically
                        agreeing to meet, and where. The Secretary said he agreed. For that they
                        would remove the last paragraph entirely. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said this was not possible. They should go to
                        separate statements. That way the Soviets would have no need for subterfuge
                        on October and November. The sides would each do what they wanted, if the
                        U.S. could go to a point statement for some reason he could not fathom. The
                        salient point at least was agreed.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he could buy the second paragraph. By dropping the third,
                        all controversy would be out. But if they went to separate statements,
                        marking substantive differences, it was better to have no statement at all,
                        since they would be laughingstocks. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said they would just have the second paragraph. That
                        would change the whole meaning. The question would be what kind of talks. On
                        trade?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied on arms. The U.S. was happy with the first paragraph as
                        discussed—“in Geneva”—and the second had been agreed. If the third paragraph
                        contained the Soviet principles, there was a problem of further elaboration.
                        The U.S. was asking just one of ours. Neither was contradictory to the
                        other. If they were not seeking a reduced level of forces, what are they
                        talking about?</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> suggested they should say that
                        the first paragraph is as agreed, and that in the third they would say
                        “spare no effort to reach an appropriate agreement.” Further, both sides
                        would be free to add whatever they wanted, with one, two, or three breaths,
                        on their own responsibility. The Secretary said that should be typed up. The
                        U.S. did not want to create controversy.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary opined that in the spirit of revolution they sometimes flirted
                        with it. He asked how this thing should be done physically. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said it was late in Moscow. In
                        order to avoid inequality, if they went to the press tomorrow morning, was
                        there danger of counterrevolution? It was too late for Soviet <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> and morning newspapers. The Secretary
                        agreed: they could say after their meeting that there would be a joint
                        announcement tomorrow. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said
                        they would announce that tomorrow a joint statement would be made. The
                        Secretary asked what time. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        suggested they say 8:00 a.m. in Washington, 4:00 p.m. in Moscow. It would be
                        time for the evening news. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        said it needed to be earlier if it were to make <hi rend="italic">Izvestiya</hi>. The Secretary suggested 7:00 a.m. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said no, let them stay with 8:00
                        a.m. Washington time.</p>
                    <pb n="279" facs="0310" xml:id="pg_279"/>
                    <p>The Secretary asked what, beyond this question, should be their joint press
                        line: perhaps a “far-ranging review of the international situation. . . .”
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> replied they should say
                        they had an exchange of views on a series of principled questions of
                        U.S./Soviet relations; and on several problems of the international
                        situation; and that discussion would be continued at the next session. The
                        Secretary agreed.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> added that whatever else they
                        said would be on their separate consciences, their separate responsibility.
                        The Secretary asked about characterization of the atmosphere. He would
                        suggest “frank and businesslike.” <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said he liked “frank and businesslike.” He
                            agreed.<note n="4" xml:id="d89fn4">The final version of the joint
                            statement read: “At their meeting on September 23, 1981, the U.S.
                            Secretary of State, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Alexander M. Haig,
                                Jr.</persName>, and the U.S.S.R. Foreign Minister, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Andrei A. Gromyko</persName>, exchanged views
                            regarding arms control involving those nuclear arms which were earlier
                            discussed between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. representatives in Geneva.
                            They agreed on the need to hold formal negotiations on such arms and on
                            behalf of their governments agreed to begin these negotiations on
                            November 30 in Geneva, Switzerland. The U.S. side will be represented at
                            the negotiations by a delegation headed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NPH_1">Paul Nitze</persName>, and the Soviet side will
                            be represented by a delegation headed by Ambassador U.A. Kvitsinskiy.
                            Both sides believe in the importance of these negotiations for enhancing
                            stability and international security and pledged to spare no effort to
                            reach an appropriate agreement.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, October 1981, p. 5)</note>

                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that at their next
                        meeting, they would certainly exchange views on broad questions of strategic
                        arms limitations, also on medium-range nuclear weapons. He would also ask
                        some questions of a geographic, political, and general nature. Since they
                        had more or less discussed Soviet/American relations today, he would touch
                        on some details in that field, to get them out of the way, and pass on to
                        strategic and medium-range weapons. The rest was up to the Secretary.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he would include further details on immediate crisis
                        areas. Afghanistan was one, in line with their earlier discussion.
                        Recognizing the limitations, there was also the Cuban problem. There were
                        also bilateral issues.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said if they talked more about
                        Afghanistan there would be nothing left but the bottom of their shoes. The
                        Secretary rejoined he had suggested it.</p>

                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> suggested that we
                        discuss further some major questions involving the relations between the two
                        countries and the general international situation. We had devoted the major
                        portion of our last meeting<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">See <ref target="#d88">Documents 88</ref> and <ref target="#d89">89</ref>.</note> to this topic, but it was necessary to deal more
                        thoroughly with some issues. Once again it might be advisable to pursue the
                        discussion in terms of principle. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not want to delve too deeply into the details.
                        He thought that our interests would be met best by pursuing the discussion
                        in terms of principle and by considering our mutual relations from the
                        standpoint of how to approach them in principle. If <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> understood correctly, the
                        Secretary, too, viewed our task along these same lines. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that he would welcome
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s comments or, if the
                        Secretary preferred, he, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>,
                        could initiate the discussion.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that he just wanted to make the point that we should
                        avoid getting into an overly detailed discussion and hoped that today we
                        could speak about some broad geopolitical topics which had been touched upon
                        at the last meeting. Perhaps this conversation would be more specific, but
                        in general he did not want to make it too detailed. Perhaps such detail
                        would be required on some arms control issues, but, again, he preferred to
                        pursue the discussion in a general sense. Perhaps we could reserve the
                        latter part of today’s discussion to a more detailed consideration of
                        bilateral issues which, in a sense, were part of the larger group of
                        questions to be discussed. The Secretary would be guided by <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s wishes in this regard. To begin
                        with, he wanted to emphasize that on Friday<note n="3" xml:id="d90fn3">September 25. According to the President’s Daily Diary, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> spoke to <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> on the telephone from 5:15 to
                            5:23 p.m. (Reagan Library, President’s Daily Diary) No memorandum for
                            the record was found.</note> he had discussed our last <pb n="281" facs="0312" xml:id="pg_281"/>meeting in some detail with President
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>. The Secretary wanted to
                        stress that the President had been pleased by the serious, sober and
                        business-like exchanges and was looking forward to the continuation of these
                        discussions.</p>
                    <p>By way of a starting point, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        wanted to say that in meetings between Soviet representatives and
                        representatives of other states here in New York, the latter had almost
                        without exception expressed a most positive reaction with respect to the
                        understanding reached concerning the forthcoming Soviet-U.S. negotiations in
                        Geneva. He assumed that the Secretary had encountered the same reaction.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> viewed this reaction as
                        appropriate and understood it. Moreover, he assumed that this feeling was
                        characteristic not only for the delegates to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly, but was world-wide. This testified to the
                        great importance attached throughout the world to mutual understanding
                        between the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and U.S. on major policy
                        problems. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> assumed that he had
                        drawn the correct conclusion.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wished to go on to some
                        questions on which he wanted to express his assessment and present his
                        understanding in terms of Soviet-U.S. relations and in terms of the
                        international situation in general. During our last meeting, while reaching
                        agreement on the text of the joint document, the Soviet side had noted that
                        the Secretary, and thus the U.S. Government, was not fully impressed by the
                        principle of equality and equal security, a principle which, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to emphasize, the Soviet
                        side considered to be of great importance. The Secretary was aware, of
                        course, that the Soviet side frequently emphasized the importance of this
                        principle. In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to pose a question: Why was it that in the
                        past the Soviet Union and the U.S. had succeeded in achieving significant
                        and important agreements? <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        noted that the Secretary was no stranger to the negotiations leading to
                        those agreements; in a certain capacity he had something to do with them in
                        a different administration.</p>
                    <p>Why, he repeated, were those agreements achieved? Because the Soviet Union
                        and the U.S. proceeded from the premise that an indispensable element of our
                        relationship was that it be conducted on the basis on the principle of
                        equality. Conversely, if one of the sides, whether the U.S. or <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, were to ignore this principle and were
                        to try to impinge on the legitimate interests of the other side, that is, if
                        it were to try to get ahead of the other side, to achieve a unilateral
                        advantage, there could be no agreement.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> went on to say that the two
                        sides had reached the aforementioned agreements and had successfully moved
                        forward in their mutual relationship—and thus had contributed to an improved
                        international situation—because they had respected this principle. Indeed,
                        in order to erect the structure of our relationship, it was necessary to <pb n="282" facs="0313" xml:id="pg_282"/>envisage a plan for that structure,
                        and at that earlier time the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the
                        U.S. did have such a plan. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        suggested that this was a case of architecture in politics. He was not
                        trying to say by this that there would be no friction, no problems, in the
                        course of negotiations. The Secretary would know very well that especially
                        with respect to strategic arms there had been several concrete situations
                        when it had been necessary, for example, to resolve a number of parameters
                        regarding specific types of strategic systems as they applied to one of the
                        sides. The Soviet side, too, had raised for consideration the matter of
                        parameters involving specific types of strategic offensive arms.</p>
                    <p>Of course there had been arguments. It had been necessary to establish
                        mutually acceptable equivalents applicable to different specific types.
                        Efforts were made to find solutions—and they were found—in Moscow, if not in
                        Moscow then in Geneva, if not in Geneva, then in Washington. This was done
                        at the ministerial level and at the very highest level; at times differences
                        were thrashed out by experts on the level of the Geneva Delegations and
                        appropriate equivalents, acceptable to both sides, were found.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that to put it mildly the
                        Soviet side reacted with concern—and he did not want to say more—to the
                        cavalier attitude of the U.S. side to the principle of equality and equal
                        security. This put the Soviet side very much—<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> repeated, very much—on its guard. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> could not imagine how we could seek
                        understandings if we were to knock the principle of equality and equal
                        security from under our feet. The need for the principle of equality and
                        equal security was crystal clear, especially in negotiations on strategic
                        arms. In the future, as in the past, there could be arguments and
                        differences of view, but, as in the past, we should discuss the issues,
                        weigh them, call on science and technology, and find solutions that were
                        mutually acceptable to both sides. Neither side could impose on the other
                        what was unacceptable to it.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> went on to say that frequently
                        one could read statements by U.S. officials—and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not wish to cite names, since the Secretary was
                        familiar with them—to the effect that the U.S. not only had to be a powerful
                        nation, but that it had to be the most powerful nation. Sometimes this
                        wording was modified slightly to the effect that the U.S. should not be
                        weaker than any other nation, that is the Soviet Union, but basically the
                        meaning was the same: militarily the U.S. was to be the most powerful
                        country. This ran counter to the principle of equality and equal
                        security.</p>
                    <p>Thus, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> asked the Secretary to
                        respond to the Soviet Union, to the Soviet Government, on the following
                        question: Could the Soviet side expect that negotiations on strategic
                        offensive arms and on those arms which were discussed at our last meeting
                        would be pursued on <pb n="283" facs="0314" xml:id="pg_283"/>the basis of
                        the principle of equality and equal security, or did the U.S. intend to
                        destroy this principle to smithereens. If the U.S. intention was to destroy
                        this principle, even potentially destroy it, then the prospects were grim
                        indeed and the Soviet authorities would be forced to explain the true
                        situation to their own people and others. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> hoped very much—he repeated that he hoped very
                        much—that he would not be faced with such a situation.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary responded that in his view <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s comments provided a point of departure from which
                        we must develop our understanding. A major problem with language involved
                        rhetorical concepts because experience and perception affected them. For
                        example, there was the concept of detente, mentioned by the Secretary last
                        week. On the face of it, “equality” was not a difficult word. It could not
                        be abandoned if there were to be constructive negotiations. The Secretary
                        repeated that it could not be abandoned. It had to be the basis of
                        negotiations. But in reflecting upon the early seventies when, for example,
                        we were moving in the direction of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>,
                        the objective reality was that as these negotiations reached a high level of
                        progress and intensified, we were feeling the consequences of maturing
                        efforts in Soviet arms programs—strategic, medium-range and conventional. In
                        a popular sense all of this tended to generate questions in the minds of the
                        American people regarding the meaning of “equality,” as this word was used
                        in our bilateral relationships, and many people express the view that
                        “equality” was a formula for Soviet advantage. It was the Soviet practice
                        that put the term in question. Therefore we had to be careful that in
                        establishing a principle, we did not ignore events.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary could say categorically that from the U.S. standpoint he could
                        not conceive of credible negotiations on arms or other geopolitical topics
                        in which mutual advantage, balance and equality were not an essential
                        objective. Thus, the Secretary had no problem with the principle. The
                        problem lay with the application of the principle on the contemporary scene.
                        As for the question raised by <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        regarding application of the principle, the Secretary would say that these
                        were code words and words meant little; objective reality must determine
                        their validity.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> replied that the answer was
                        clear. He wanted to summarize his understanding of the Secretary’s reply.
                        Although the Secretary had spoken of “equality” and had not used the term
                        “principle of equality and equal security”—and of course equal security was
                        the essence of the matter and thus inseparable from equality—the concept was
                        acceptable to the U.S. As for its application, its implementation, in each
                        individual case one had to find the relevant relationships, the relevant
                        proportions between categories of weapons to be included in the negotiations
                        and to be considered. This went without saying. He <pb n="284" facs="0315" xml:id="pg_284"/>had tried to emphasize that the two sides would
                        naturally encounter situations in which the search for genuine equality
                        would require solutions of a kind that satisfied both sides in terms of
                        figures and data. This had been true in the past, it would be true in the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> attached
                        importance to what the Secretary had said about acceptability of the
                        principle of equality and adherence to that principle. He thought that now
                        we could look toward the future with greater confidence, especially with
                        regard to negotiations about strategic systems—a subject on which we had not
                        yet reached an understanding, that is on the timing of these discussions—and
                        with regard to medium-range systems in Europe.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to touch on one
                        particular aspect, especially taking into account the Secretary’s statement.
                        The U.S. side was arguing rather emphatically that U.S. Forward Based
                        Systems in Europe did not provide the U.S. with any advantage. In line with
                        this reasoning the U.S. discussed individual problems as if this factor did
                        not exist. The U.S. side saw only two sets of figures: Soviet and U.S.
                        systems, Soviet and <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> systems. The U.S.
                        was comparing only these two columns of figures. Of course, privately the
                        U.S. could not but take this factor into account, but publicly and in
                        discussions with the Soviet Union the U.S. ignored the fact that U.S.
                        medium-range systems were deployed at sites from which they could reach
                        targets in the Soviet Union, whereas Soviet medium-range systems were
                        deployed at sites from which they could not reach targets on U.S. territory.
                        This gave the U.S. a major advantage and was a factor that could not be
                        ignored. Any knowledgeable individual, not necessarily someone dealing with
                        strategic or medium-range systems, recognized its importance. Regardless of
                        whether or not the Secretary agreed with this, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> asked him not to demand a strict mathematical
                        formula. Even if, by way of example, the Soviet Union were to have as
                        many—and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> could have equally
                        well said three times as many or four times as many—nuclear weapons or
                        medium-range systems as <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, the U.S.
                        advantage would still not be eliminated, precisely because the U.S. systems
                        could reach Soviet territory, whereas not a single Soviet weapon could
                        strike U.S. territory.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary interjected that a three-to-one ratio was more relevant.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> continued that in fact the
                        Soviet Union did not have a two-to-one advantage. In reality, at present it
                        was the U.S. which enjoyed a 50 percent advantage in the number of nuclear
                        weapons. He had made these comments merely by way of illustration and
                        because this was a problem the sides would encounter at the negotiations in
                        Geneva. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not wish to say
                        more on the subject today. He had provided this illustration in order that
                        the U.S. side not be surprised <pb n="285" facs="0316" xml:id="pg_285"/>when
                        the delegations began negotiations in Geneva. Of course, in discussing this
                        subject the Soviet side would touch on the mathematics of it.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary wanted to say briefly that he did not anticipate negotiating
                        here and did not wish to prejudge the negotiations concerning arms control.
                        He wanted to emphasize that we were entering these talks with serious
                        intentions and with a view to achieving effective and verifiable agreements.
                        The Secretary would emphasize that we have moved into the so-called <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> or medium-range category within the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> framework, because of the great
                        complexities involved. In this connection the Secretary wanted to mention
                        several principles in response to the issues <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had just raised.</p>
                    <p>First, we viewed the vulnerability of our allies in the same category as
                        vulnerability of the U.S. We were completely integrated in security terms.
                        The Secretary wanted to emphasize again that we were approaching the subject
                        within the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> framework. Second, he had
                        already told <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> with regard to
                        medium-range systems in Europe that because of the mobility and range of the
                        system at the center of initial concern they required, in our view, a global
                        approach. Third, in the same spirit of preventing surprises, he wanted to
                        say that if we were to focus initially on the complex issue of Forward Based
                        Systems and corresponding Soviet systems—aircraft and SLBM delivery
                        systems—we might find ourselves facing a confused and incomprehensible
                        situation. Therefore, initially we should focus on medium-range land-based
                        systems.</p>
                    <p>As we proceeded further and developed a more comprehensive and mutually
                        acceptable concept, the Secretary was looking forward to an equal reduction
                        of capabilities, hopefully at a low level. However, we were entering these
                        negotiations without pre-conditions. In connection with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s remarks about two-to-one or
                        three-to-one, he wanted to emphasize that our calculations when the
                        Secretary was with <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> were more like
                        three-to-one and four-to-one in the Soviet favor on comparable systems. This
                        was an issue to be resolved at the negotiating table with an exchange of
                        data. The Secretary hoped to receive such data from the Soviet side, just as
                        we intended to provide our data so as to eliminate a high level of
                        confusion. The Secretary thought that it would be foolish to go much further
                        today.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary wanted to take this opportunity to say a word or two in
                        connection with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> because this was
                        intimately linked to what we were discussing. He wanted to outline our
                        thinking on this score, as well as how we intended to approach this
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> noted that the Secretary had
                        touched on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and the prospects for
                        future talks on that question. In this connection, he wanted to pose a
                        question: Did the U.S. Administration think that <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II was <pb n="286" facs="0317" xml:id="pg_286"/>finished?,
                        that the Treaty was dead? The Soviet side did not think so. This Treaty had
                        been worked out and negotiated to account for all the factors involved. The
                        two sides had accomplished delicate work, and the Soviet side was convinced
                        that there was no justification for the sides to abandon the results of that
                        work and to regard the Treaty as having been buried.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had the
                        following specific question: Sometime ago the Secretary’s predecessor,
                        Secretary Muskie, had inquired whether the Soviet Union thought that while
                        juridically the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty was not in
                        force, the sides could in fact consider it to be in effect until they had
                        reached some other understanding or agreement. In other words, could the two
                        parties consider the obligations assumed by them to be in effect? Of course,
                        at that time the Soviet side believed that the Treaty would be brought into
                        force as soon as possible, and the U.S. had not said “yes” or “no” on that
                        score. Thus, the Soviet side, for its part, had not provided a “yes” or “no”
                        response.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was raising the question of
                        whether the current U.S. administration believed that the obligations
                        assumed under the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty could be
                        considered to be in effect. In the event that the Secretary provided a
                        positive response, it would probably be appropriate for the sides to express
                        such an understanding in some way. Perhaps this should be done through a
                        joint statement or through separate synchronized statements; perhaps some
                        other form could be found by mutual agreement between the two sides.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was thinking along the
                        lines of an arrangement that would not prejudge the final outcome. He added
                        that when he was speaking about the Treaty being actually in effect, he also
                        meant to include the Protocol to the Treaty. Naturally, some wording might
                        be required regarding modification of the timing in connection with certain
                        measures covered by the Protocol. He repeated that naturally the Protocol
                        should also be covered by an appropriate understanding.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary expressed the view that the answer to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s more specific question, raised in
                        the latter part of his comments, would have to be derived from a more
                        fundamental assessment of the first part of his remarks, that is with regard
                        to the status of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty
                        itself. Here the Secretary wanted to be frank. In the interests of our
                        future dialogue he felt that he should speak frankly and bluntly. This was a
                        requirement in terms of an underpinning for a dialogue on any subject. The
                        simple fact was that unfortunately the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty had been in trouble almost from the day of its
                        inception on substantive grounds, because it contained freeways of unlimited
                        growth for certain systems.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary was saying this on the basis of his observation in his own
                        country. In terms of the political overtones in the U.S., the <pb n="287" facs="0318" xml:id="pg_287"/>
                  <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II
                        Treaty was impaled on the rocks because of the perceptions in the U.S. of
                        aggressive Soviet activities in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The Secretary had
                        told this to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> last time. Thus,
                        in principle the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty was on the
                        rockpile of history, it was dead. There was no way in which a U.S. President
                        could revive that agreement.</p>
                    <p>By this the Secretary did not mean to suggest for a moment that the
                        preparatory work which had gone into the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty, and which had been carried out during the
                            post-<gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I negotiations, should be
                        discarded. This work provided an unprecedented amount of data and thinking
                        of the two sides, which would be invaluable in the future. This was one of
                        the causes of the delay in the U.S. We needed to find a new basis for a
                        better solution of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> problem and we
                        were working on it. We had been at it diligently for the past seven months.
                        The Secretary believed that this work would be concluded in the
                        not-too-distant-future, drawing heavily on what had occurred in the past and
                        on political reality.</p>
                    <p>He did not want to suggest that <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II was
                        merely a victim of Afghanistan. This was not entirely true. There were a
                        number of reservations of a substantive nature. The status, he thought, was
                        clear: the U.S. would be guided by the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I negotiations and the Vladivostok Understanding, and by
                        the spirit thereof, if it was not undercut by the Soviet side. It was in
                        this context that the Secretary wanted to make some comments with respect to
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s suggestion. We had said
                        unilaterally that we would be guided by Soviet actions. Overall we would be
                        governed by what the Soviet side did, and the Secretary wanted to emphasize
                        this. The Secretary had spoken about the essential importance of a balance,
                        and this involved the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II arrangement,
                        which was more dynamic with respect to the Soviet side than the U.S. side.
                        The Secretary concluded by saying that perhaps he had not answered <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s question as precisely as the
                        latter would have preferred. But the Secretary had spoken with the frankness
                        that he considered necessary.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that, as he
                        understood it, the Secretary was unable to give a positive response.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that in a sense there was a public commitment regarding
                        the obligations of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty. He
                        believed that we would be well served to leave alone our public statements
                        so far. That is, we would be guided by whether or not these obligations were
                        undercut and by whether or not the overall balance remained intact. The
                        Secretary thought that it might be desirable to articulate this matter more
                        precisely at a later time, recognizing that the Soviet side was justified in
                        wanting to know the U.S. position.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that of course this
                        question had been raised by Washington quite some time ago. In a way, the
                        Secretary had some<pb n="288" facs="0319" xml:id="pg_288"/>thing to do with
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> at that time. Now <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to ask a specific question:
                        When would Washington be ready to embark on the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> problem? <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        hoped to hear at least a preliminary answer for planning purposes.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary responded that he anticipated with a fair degree of certainty
                        that this would occur in the first part of next year. He did not anticipate
                        a delay beyond that. On the outside, this could mean some six months, on the
                        inside perhaps three months. He wanted to emphasize that the President had
                        not had the chance to study the various alternatives being prepared.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to inform the Secretary
                        that for all intents and purposes the Soviet Union was prepared to initiate
                        discussions on this problem whenever the U.S. side was ready.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that in reading
                        statements made by the highest U.S. officials, including the President, the
                        Secretary, the Secretary of Defense and other high officials, as well as
                        other statements in the press, one gathered the impression that a concept
                        existed in the U.S. according to which the United States was prepared to
                        consider and resolve outstanding problems with the Soviet Union—bilateral
                        problems and international problems, including those we had discussed a
                        moment ago—only if the Soviet Union renounced its foreign policy. Sometimes
                        this concept was formulated differently: it was said that the Soviet Union
                        should go back on its foreign policy aims, but in fact the point was that it
                        should renounce its foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not understand what was
                        behind this. Was this an effort to influence the Soviet Union, to frighten
                        it? To put it mildly, this would be so unrealistic that one could not be but
                        amazed. Why was this concept being advanced? One would think that any
                        expectation that the Soviet Union would renounce its foreign policy—and thus
                        renounce itself—was totally hopeless. What would adherence to such a
                        conception mean? In fact it would mean a dead end in terms of resolving all
                        international issues. Never in the history of the world, never in the
                        history of the Soviet Union, never in the history of the United States or in
                        the history of U.S.-Soviet relations had there been a situation when one
                        power told the other “renounce your foreign policy,” and when relations were
                        conducted on that basis.</p>
                    <p>The fact was that the advancement of such a condition, above all to a major
                        power, meant that solutions to problems became impossible. This was an utter
                        dead end in terms of resolving international problems. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> suggested that the Secretary
                        imagine a situation in which the Soviet Union told the U.S. that before
                        negotiations could begin on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>,
                        medium-range systems, the situation in various areas of the world or in
                        Europe, or on bilateral issues, the U.S. first had to renounce its foreign
                        policy, for example, that it had to remove its forces or <pb n="289" facs="0320" xml:id="pg_289"/>military bases from Europe, that it had to
                        close down its military bases along the perimeter of the Soviet Union, or
                        withdraw its navy from the Mediterranean. The Secretary might mention that
                        there was also a Soviet fleet in the Mediterranean, but the Soviet Union was
                        not the first to send its fleet to that area—or withdraw U.S. forces from
                        the Indian Ocean—the Secretary might say, of course, that there were Soviet
                        forces in that area too, but the Soviet Union had previously said that it
                        was prepared to withdraw its forces from that area. The U.S. would probably
                        refuse to accept such a concept. To hook one problem to another, and then to
                        a third and a fourth problem, and to tie them all up into one knot, each
                        part to the other and everything to all else, constituted an utter dead end;
                        things would become so hopeless that nothing could be resolved.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> went on to say that the very
                        effect that such a concept was being raised . . . <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not complete the sentence,
                        explaining that he did not wish to use strong words. It was thoughtless to
                        use such a concept. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would
                        think that the Secretary, in his capacity as Secretary of State, would
                        recognize that such a concept was unrealistic and unfounded. Never in the
                        history of the world have relations been conducted on such a basis, and they
                        never would be. The U.S. was driving itself into a corner by advancing that
                        concept. We would not be able to agree on anything if the U.S. were to
                        insist on that concept.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, if the U.S. were to insist on it, then it would be acting
                        contrary to its own statements. The U.S. was correct not to adhere to that
                        concept, but since this involved an inconsistency with its own statements,
                        why advance that concept in the first place? Accordingly, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> hoped that Washington would adopt a
                        more realistic, more justified and more sober point of view. What he was
                        saying was not some kind of new discovery. The necessity for a realistic
                        basis was not something the Soviet Union was raising only now; this
                        necessity has existed since the creation of the world.</p>
                    <p>Our common approach should involve solutions to the most pressing problems.
                        As a general rule, solution of one problem helped resolve another problem,
                        and so forth. That was the appropriate concept. It was for this reason that
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had found it necessary to
                        raise this matter with the Secretary. The entire Soviet leadership had
                        wondered why this concept was being advanced ever more frequently in the
                        U.S., and at very high levels at that. President <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> personally had asked <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> to pose this question. Adherence to this concept was
                        contrary to what the Secretary had spoken of today. Accordingly, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> hoped to hear the Secretary’s
                        comments on this matter. Perhaps the U.S. was attaching some significance to
                        this in terms of propaganda, but there was hardly any political capital to
                        be gained from this. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> doubted
                        it.</p>
                    <pb n="290" facs="0321" xml:id="pg_290"/>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that a good answer to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s question required some detailed listing of issues.
                        He had gone very carefully over our discussion last time and had been
                        somewhat surprised—though perhaps he should not have been, given our global
                        responsibilities—that generally both of us had touched on the same
                        geopolitical issues: Poland, Kampuchea, Libya, Cuba, Southern Africa, Iran,
                        Pakistan and Afghanistan. We had touched on all of these last week. Of
                        course, these issues did not constitute an all-inclusive listing, but it was
                        interesting that we both saw the same set of concrete issues in a global
                        sense. The Secretary wanted to touch on each of them in order to provide
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> with a sense of our
                        principles and in conclusion he wanted to ask <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> a question.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that it went without saying that Poland was of grave
                        concern to the Soviet Union, the United States, to the West in general and,
                        the Secretary believed, to all of Eastern Europe as well. We had reiterated,
                        not only on behalf of the U.S. Government, but on behalf of our allies and
                        the entire West, as well as Japan, that it should be made very clear that
                        any external involvement in the internal affairs of the Polish people would
                        lead to grave consequences in connection with everything we have spoken of,
                        in connection with everything we hoped to achieve. He thought that restraint
                        should be the dominant approach, and that the situation, as he saw it, had
                        improved somewhat even now.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said with regard to Kampuchea that the international community
                        was opposed to what was occurring in that country. While recognizing that
                        Moscow was not necessarily making Hanoi’s decisions, it also had to be
                        recognized that Hanoi could not carry them out without the substantial
                        support of the Soviet Union. Vietnam was now isolated in the world, its
                        economy devastated, and this would continue in the future. The Secretary
                        recommended that the Soviet Union urge Hanoi to participate in the
                        international conference that had been called for, with a view to achieving
                        a political solution.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that Libya was engaging in increasingly irresponsible
                        actions that constituted a threat to world peace. He thought that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> had the resources to do what he was
                        doing, but the Secretary also thought that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> could not do so without the logistical support of
                        the Soviet Union. If <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                        continued these actions, international peace and Western interests would be
                        jeopardized, and we would have to react. In the Secretary’s view, it would
                        be most promising and helpful if the Soviet Union let <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> know that he would be on his own if
                        he continued on this risky path of international lawlessness.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary went on to say that Cuba posed the more difficult problem.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had said that the U.S.
                        was reacting to the system <pb n="291" facs="0322" xml:id="pg_291"/>which
                        existed in Cuba. History belied that we were influenced by the Cuban system.
                        The system was the business of the Cuban people. But since 1974 and 1975
                        Cuban activities have been increasingly irresponsible and unacceptable by
                        all criteria of normal international behavior. No one in the U.S. accepted
                        that the Soviet Union could not restrain Cuba. At our last meeting the
                        Secretary had told <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that arms
                        shipments to Cuba had doubled compared to a year ago. Soviet assistance
                        permitted projection of Cuban military power. The Soviet Union had recently
                        provided it with modern frigates, extensive levels of armaments and
                        long-range aircraft. All of this exceeded Cuba’s defensive needs and enabled
                        it to maintain 40,000 combat troops for aggressive goals in Africa. It was
                        stepping up to a high level its subversive activities in the Western
                        hemisphere and was posing a major threat to the United States and other
                        countries that shared our values in this hemisphere. As for the future, we
                        would do what we had to. We were not able to overlook, to turn our heads
                        away from, Cuban activities. The Secretary hoped that the Soviet Union would
                        advise Havana that this was a dangerous course. Eventually we would have to
                        deal with this. The Secretary remarked that his comments had been made in
                        the spirit of frankness.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary also wanted to say a few words about Iran and Pakistan. The
                        territorial integrity and independence of Iran was of basic importance to
                        the U.S. and the entire West, and it was necessary that this reality be kept
                        in mind in the future. We had a historic relationship with Pakistan, a
                        relationship which advanced international peace and stability and which, the
                        Secretary believed, was in the Soviet interest as well. In the area of
                        nuclear weapons and in terms of political actions, the good relations
                        between the U.S. and Pakistan helped shape a constructive path. We had no
                        other interests with respect to Pakistan. We insisted that Pakistan be left
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary recalled another subject which we had discussed last week. In
                        discussing Southern Africa, which was important at this time, he was aware
                        of the question raised by <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>.
                        The Secretary believed that the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> had a common goal. We wanted to see an independent Namibia
                        as soon as possible, and Angola free of external threats or external
                        intervention. The Secretary believed that South Africa should desist from
                        certain actions in which it had engaged. The U.S., like the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, had no interest in becoming involved in
                        Southern Africa. Clearly our differences pertained more to tactics than to
                        long-range objectives. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had
                        referred to Angola as a chicken-and-egg situation. South Africa, the egg,
                        has reversed this, making it an egg-and-chicken situation. After several
                        months of anguishing discussions with South Africa, the latter now accepted
                        a compromise leading to early independence of Namibia, which would not
                        require <pb n="292" facs="0323" xml:id="pg_292"/>Angola or the international
                        community to reverse the chicken-and-egg situation, but which involved a new
                        concept. The compromise envisaged a simultaneous withdrawal of Cuban troops
                        from Angola and of South Africa from Namibia. This offered a major
                        opportunity to the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and was
                        in the interest of world peace in an area in which neither of our countries
                        had any interests. The U.S. was not opposed to the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> in Angola. The <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>
                        should on its own work towards reconciliation with the help of the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, on terms acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>. Why, the Secretary asked rhetorically,
                        should we not succeed in resolving a problem that had plagued the
                        international community for so long?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary wanted to offer some considerations with respect to
                        Afghanistan. He saw some convergence with respect to our objectives, as well
                        as a difference in tactics and what <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had called the current paradox. The Secretary
                        believed that both sides would accept a non-aligned and secure Afghanistan.
                        He thought that it was in the Soviet interest to find a formula for the
                        withdrawal of Soviet forces, perhaps a phased withdrawal. Both sides were
                        probably also seeking an Afghanistan which was on good terms with its
                        neighbors. This had an implication with respect to the Moslem objection
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had raised last time.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side concluded that there were three areas of action which ought to
                        be considered for the future, recognizing that this would require some time.
                        He thought that it would be very helpful if the following ingredients were
                        included: First, the Afghanistan Government should take steps now to broaden
                        its base. Second, the Soviet Union could simultaneously study a formula for
                        a phased withdrawal. Third, outside powers could take a number of steps,
                        including those mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        last time, regarding cross border activities from outside the borders of
                        Afghanistan. He thought that implementation of all three steps in tandem
                        could offer a solution. He also suggested that they be considered with more
                        care.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he had raised these regional issues in the context of
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s question. Our
                        experience during the post-Vietnam and post-Watergate period indicated a
                        need for more Soviet restraint and more reciprocity and, above all, for
                        respect for what had been agreed in the early 1970s. That is, a side should
                        not be perceived as gaining an advantage over the other. As for <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s and <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s question, it involved the concept of linkage and
                        the Secretary had to admit that he had spoken about it many times, as early
                        as 1971. Linkage was a fact of life. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> himself had touched on linkage when he had said that
                        the perception of improvement in one area affected other areas. This is what
                        linkage meant. In a recent speech the Secretary had said that to deny the
                        concept of linkage meant to deny the right of <pb n="293" facs="0324" xml:id="pg_293"/>challenging illegal actions.<note n="4" xml:id="d90fn4">A possible reference to <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s
                            speech before the American Bar Association in New Orleans on August 11:
                            “Linkage is not a theory; it is a fact of life that we overlook at our
                            peril.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, September
                            1981, pp. 10–13)</note> Perhaps this was a contentious way of putting
                        it. No one was trying to revolutionize the Soviet Union. The Soviet system
                        was the affair of the Soviet people.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary next wanted to deal with the matters of equality and mutual
                        respect, which above all involved the engagement of resources. He was not
                        talking about eliminating competition. That would be foolish and
                        impractical. No one hoped for it or expected it. Afghanistan constituted an
                        extremely important problem for the Soviet Union. A near-term solution in
                        Southern Africa—and given good will such a solution was possible—would be a
                        major contribution toward improving the international climate. Events such
                        as Afghanistan were what <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> was impaled
                        on. One could not deny the inter-relationship; one had to deal with it so as
                        to improve East-West relations, because we had no desire for the current
                        kind of situation. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> also had
                        some counsel regarding our participation. This is why communications were so
                        important and why we had to speak frankly without fear of offending each
                        other. The Secretary hoped that he had answered <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s question and apologized for having taken so much
                        time to do it. He thought that each of these issues affected profoundly all
                        of the questions.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> responded that the Secretary
                        had evidently concluded from his analysis that it would not be advisable to
                        tie all international problems into one knot. Thus, the Soviet Union should
                        not be confronted with a demand that it renounce its policy as a
                        precondition for negotiating and solving bilateral and international issues.
                        Assuming this was the Secretary’s conclusion, this was precisely what
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had hoped to hear. The
                        Soviet Union has been insisting on this all along.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary interjected that public renunciation of Soviet policy never had
                        been the official U.S. position. There never had been such a rigid
                        precondition. One had to be careful not to take into account each distorted
                        article or perverted statement of U.S. policy.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that he hoped never again
                        to hear from Washington a demand that the Soviet Union renounce its policy
                        or its approach by way of a precondition for solving any given problem.</p>
                    <p>Referring to the substantive part of the Secretary’s answer, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that the Secretary had dealt
                        with individual areas and with regional issues much more extensively than
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. Thus he would have to do
                        what he had already done at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General
                        Assembly. He would start in the East and gradually move to the South and the
                            <pb n="294" facs="0325" xml:id="pg_294"/>West. Was it really possible
                        that anyone had the intention of defending the Pol Pot regime and his
                        hatchetmen who, with the lighthearted assistance of the American friend
                        Peking, had thought nothing of putting at least one third of their people
                        under ground.<note n="5" xml:id="d90fn5">Reference is to the genocide of the
                            Cambodian people by Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge.</note> The time would
                        come when history would express gratitude to Vietnam for saving the
                        Kampuchean nation, for helping it to free itself from its executioners.<note n="6" xml:id="d90fn6">On December 25, 1978, Vietnamese troops invaded
                            Cambodia.</note> Of course, there could be differences of view regarding
                        some domestic activity or other, but that was the internal affair of the
                        Kampuchean people. The fact was that Vietnam had saved a nation that had
                        been on the verge of total annihilation.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps Vietnamese military assistance constituted a violation of some law,
                        or of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter? The answer was “no.”
                        Did not the U.S. provide assistance to other countries? As for Vietnam
                        itself, it had entered the path of peaceful development, it was able to
                        solve its own problems, and, in the Soviet view, quite successfully at that.
                        Perhaps this was not to the liking of some of Vietnam’s neighbors. The
                        Secretary was familiar with the act perpetrated by China several years ago
                        against Vietnam.<note n="7" xml:id="d90fn7">Chinese troops invaded Vietnam
                            in February 1979 and withdrew the following month.</note> That was naked
                        aggression. It was most unfortunate that one had not heard U.S. condemnation
                        of Peking’s aggression against Vietnam. Yet, by all the canons that was
                        aggression. The Secretary had said that Vietnam was isolating itself.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had not noticed that.
                        Vietnam was pursuing a peaceful policy in its relations with its neighbors
                        and had no aggressive plans or intentions. As for the <gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss> countries, Burma and others, they had
                        no grounds for concern. As time went on, they would be convinced of
                        Vietnam’s positive intentions toward them and that Vietnam was not scheming
                        against them. Vietnam wanted good relations with these countries.
                        Accordingly, the U.S. had no grounds for concern about future Vietnamese
                        activities.</p>
                    <p>Turning to Pakistan, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that
                        as a matter of fact Soviet relations with Pakistan had not been bad. The
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> had even been providing
                        assistance, for example in the construction of a petroleum facility. But
                        Pakistan’s foreign policy was largely a puzzle. The puzzle was mainly why
                        Pakistan did not wish to normalize its relations with Afghanistan. It was
                        not so much the juridical position of Pakistan on improving its relations
                        with Afghanistan, as the current behavior of Pakistan. The question arose
                        whether the temptation of the Pakistani leadership to obtain U.S. arms might
                        not be stronger than the desire for good relations with Afghanistan. In
                        short, the Soviet Union believed <pb n="295" facs="0326" xml:id="pg_295"/>that U.S. influence was strong and unfortunately it was not a positive
                        influence.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> thought it would be better for
                        Pakistan to resolve its differences with Afghanistan and to improve its
                        relations with India and its other neighbors. Evidently, however, under U.S.
                        influence Pakistan had no intention of moving in that direction. Perhaps the
                        Secretary ought to give some thought to this matter. He might conclude that
                        improved relations between Pakistan and its neighbors would not only serve
                        the interests of Pakistan, but also the interests of the U.S. None of
                        Pakistan’s neighbors wanted to be swallowed by Pakistan. The Soviet Union
                        would object strongly. The present Pakistani leadership had an amazing
                        talent for creating enemies along its own borders. As the Soviet Union
                        understood it, this did not serve the interests of U.S. policy either.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to make a few comments
                        about Afghanistan, since the Secretary had spoken about it at length today.
                        Here was the U.S. Secretary of State sitting on a couch right next to
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. The two were discussing
                        major issues of Soviet-U.S. relations and of the international situation.
                        The two men reflected the views of the highest authorities in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and in the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to say by this that they
                        might well have the opportunity to find the key to resolving this situation.
                        Perhaps they would be able to turn the key that opened the door. Of course,
                        neither side could dictate to Pakistan or to Afghanistan, but why should
                        these two countries, independently and separately from each other, not
                        listen to, and heed friendly advice derived from good intentions, that is if
                        such friendly advice could be found.</p>
                    <p>As <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had said during our last
                        conversation, we should act toward a cessation of external aggression
                        against Afghanistan. Of course, that required some negotiations between the
                        parties concerned. But since when was Zia ul Haq such a good democrat that
                        he was unable to deal with the Afghan authorities? When did the U.S.
                        transform him into such a good democrat? In any event, perhaps the
                        possibility <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had referred to
                        did exist. This might produce a sigh of relief in Pakistan and would be
                        helpful to the Government of Afghanistan, to the U.S. and to the Soviet
                        Union. An end to outside intervention would suffice to reach agreement on
                        the matter of emigration and would permit the solutions already mentioned by
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> to the Secretary.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to emphasize again
                        what he had said last time, namely that Afghanistan was offering assistance
                        to returning emigres. He believed that in the event of such a development
                        even the American friend Iran would be forced to accept the situation,
                        whether <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> or <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> believed that this was
                        worth trying.</p>
                    <p>He certainly was not begging the U.S. The Soviet Union did not find itself in
                        water up to its ears. He already had occasion to tell the <pb n="296" facs="0327" xml:id="pg_296"/>Secretary that the Soviet Union did not
                        have an enemy in the military sense in Afghanistan. By the same token, he
                        wanted to note that the internal, the social situation in Afghanistan, was
                        irreversible. As he understood it, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the U.S. were in agreement on their desire for a
                        non-aligned and sovereign Afghanistan. This was a situation akin to U.S.
                        freeway interchanges. This was at the core of the solution of the Afghan
                        situation. It was necessary to assess the situation, and to do so
                        deliberately. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> asked the
                        Secretary to give further thought to this matter.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> next wanted to turn to Africa
                        and say a few words about Angola and Cuba. The Soviet Union was surprised:
                        how could the U.S. associate itself with the aggressor, in fact become an
                        accomplice of South Africa, the aggressor? South Africa had attacked Angola
                        in clear daylight; it was strangling the Namibians and had not been opposed
                        strongly enough. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> could not
                        envisage greater indignation against racism than the feeling which Africans
                        held for South Africa. Anything stronger could only be outright war. Even
                        here, at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly, all the
                        delegates were indignant.</p>
                    <p>As for the Angolans, they were acting peacefully and the Soviet Union was
                        familiar with Angola’s intention; the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        had good relations with Angola, in fact has a treaty with that country.
                        Angola had no aggressive designs against its neighbors; it had repeatedly
                        assured the Soviet Union of this. It did have difficulties with the <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> bands and with <persName corresp="#p_SJM_1">Savimbi</persName>. Were it not for the interference
                        of all these groups, the Cubans would disappear.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, U.S. policy hindered resolution of this problem. This was a
                        problem which also ought to be considered carefully. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was not privy to U.S. plans
                        regarding Angola, whether favorable or unfavorable. In his view, U.S.
                        relations with Angola should be based on the recognition that there were no
                        perfidious plans. Why did the Cubans come? They were asked to come, they did
                        not force their presence on Angola. The U.S. disliked Cuba. Had there been
                        no aggression against Angola, the Secretary’s statement would sound
                        different. But this constituted assistance against external aggression.
                        Emotions had no place there.</p>
                    <p>Finally, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to comment on
                        U.S.-Cuban relations. The Secretary had to such an extent tangled up his
                        comments about Cuba, Africa and other matters, that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> felt justified in expressing his
                        views at this stage. The U.S. did not like the Cuban social system, it did
                        not like Cuba’s socialist system. In this connection, he again wanted to
                        draw the Secretary’s attention to what he, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, had said at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        General Assembly. The Cuban Socialist system was an internal matter. The
                        Secretary did not refer to Cuba except in a hostile tone. And yet the
                        Secretary had also said that domestic affairs were domestic affairs.</p>
                    <pb n="297" facs="0328" xml:id="pg_297"/>
                    <p>The Secretary had called Cuba an aggressor. What country had Cuba taken over?
                        The answer was “none.” Nor did Cuba have such intentions. The U.S. was
                        accusing Cuba of supplying arms to several Latin American countries. The
                        Soviet Union had become interested in this matter and whether the Secretary
                        would believe it or not, this assertion was not true. Cuba was not supplying
                        such arms. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> suggested that it
                        was up to the Secretary to determine the sources of his information. The
                        U.S. was accusing Cuba of involvement in connection with El Salvador. But
                        this was an artificial accusation, a contrived assertion. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> could not say the same about the
                        U.S. role in El Salvador. Sympathies and antipathies were irrelevant in this
                        connection. Interference was something else again.</p>
                    <p>Was Cuba not offended by the fact that the U.S. had in effect imposed an
                        economic blockade on it? <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        suggested that the Secretary try to picture himself in the Cuban position.
                        Was the existence of a U.S. military base in Cuba, contrary to the wishes of
                        the Cuban people, not deeply offensive to the Cubans?<note n="8" xml:id="d90fn8">A reference to the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo
                            Bay.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not know whether the
                        Secretary was able mentally to place himself in the Cuban position. The
                        Secretary would also recall that the Cubans had made a number of steps to
                        meet the U.S. halfway, that they had gone far to accommodate the U.S.
                        Admittedly this had occurred during the Administration of President
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>, but it was the same
                        country regardless of whether the <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> Administration or the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration was in office.</p>
                    <p>And in the final analysis, what kind of threat did Cuba pose to the U.S.? It
                        posed no threat, and the U.S. knew this very well. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> went on to say that Soviet-U.S.
                        relations in the context of Cuba were clear. There existed an understanding
                        on that score. So this problem was clear. Given the above, was it
                        appropriate to unleash emotions about Cuba in such a sharp form? The Soviet
                        Union did not think that this was appropriate. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> suggested that the U.S. leave Cuba alone, that it
                        let the Cubans live as they would, and that it permit Cuba to resolve its
                        domestic problems as it saw fit. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        believed that such an approach would be a credit to U.S. foreign policy. At
                        this point the U.S. had wound itself up about Cuba. What for? There was no
                        reason for this in connection with Cuba. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> also wanted to make some remarks about China, but
                        first he would welcome any observations the Secretary might wish to
                        offer.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that clearly U.S. information about Cuba was at variance
                        with what Cuba was telling the Soviet Union. We had absolute, categorical
                        and irrefutable evidence about Cuban aggression <pb n="298" facs="0329" xml:id="pg_298"/>in Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, where
                        it was trying to change the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>. The Secretary
                        wanted to assure <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that we
                        would deal with matters of this nature. The Secretary regretted that
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> seemed to believe that
                        events in this hemisphere required U.S. grace and acceptance. We would not
                        and could not do so. The Secretary was raising all these issues in the
                        context of what was under discussion.</p>
                    <p>He regretted <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s standard
                        replies about Angola. Our allies and we will regret a lack of progress in
                        this area. We believed that responsible cooperation could contribute to
                        peace in Southern Africa. The U.S. was not looking for any advantages in
                        Southern Africa. We had hoped, but had again been disappointed by what we
                        thought was the outline of a broad principle. We had hoped for
                        implementation of practical steps and would decry an absence of reciprocity
                        or progress. The Secretary wished to emphasize most clearly that these
                        actions were fundamental and that failure to implement them would complicate
                        our relationship, which the Secretary would regret. He thought that a
                        withdrawal was in the interests of a constructive relationship between the
                        U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>He sensed no feeling on <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s part
                        that the latter wanted to cooperate with us with regard to a number of
                        problems, and the Secretary regretted this. He was not begging <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> about Angola, this was not in our
                        interest. But he had felt that it was in the interests of international
                        stability and normalcy to be helpful. This was not a plaintive call, rather
                        it was a constructive proposal for peace and stability. This was as true in
                        this hemisphere as it was in Africa. The U.S. was prepared to cooperate with
                        the Soviet Union on this problem, but <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s value judgments, to the effect that we did not
                        know what we were saying and that we had an emotional fear of Cuba, were
                        nonsense. China and Yugoslavia had systems with which we were not
                        comfortable. The Secretary believed that international behavior involved a
                        system of justice. He hoped that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> could think over this matter more intensely and
                        perhaps it would be possible to find a basis for coordinated action.
                        Otherwise, the whole undertaking would become a farce. We could not approach
                        mutual relations on a set of principles contrary to decency and law. There
                        was no way in which we could do so.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> now wanted to turn to China.
                        The Secretary was probably aware of Soviet-U.S. discussions of China at
                        different levels. The Soviet side had touched on this matter at the highest
                        levels, including the summit level. This was because for some years now
                        there had been evidence of China and the U.S. drawing closer together. If
                        this drawing together had involved a peace-loving state, then it would be an
                        entirely different matter. The fact was, however, that China pursued a
                            militaris<pb n="299" facs="0330" xml:id="pg_299"/>tic policy, that it
                        did not believe in peace and that it had a conception of war. Under these
                        conditions the Soviet Union viewed all steps in the direction of a closer
                        drawing together between the U.S. and China as hostile actions against the
                        Soviet Union. Moreover, demonstrated hostility against the Soviet Union was
                        involved. Statements were being openly made that the U.S. and China were in
                        fact acting in a uniform direction even though they were not even allies. No
                        secret was made of the fact that the idea behind all this was opposition to
                        the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>How should the Soviet Union react in the face of all this? Clearly it had to
                        draw the relevant conclusions. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> regretted that the U.S. had embarked on this road.
                        Having drawn the appropriate conclusion, the Soviet Union especially noted
                        the drawing together between the U.S. and China in the military area. It has
                        specifically noted the U.S. decision to supply weapons and military
                        equipment to China. The Soviet Union could not but note this. The Secretary
                        did not have to reply to the following question: Was Washington certain that
                        Peking which today sang with a voice of a nightingale would in the future,
                        behave like a nightingale? Did Washington anticipate any changes in this
                        regard?</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to point out in this
                        connection that this question had a certain sharp edge in the historical
                        perspective. The Secretary should not think that the Soviet Union was scared
                        out of its wits. It was not scared, it simply viewed the problem in a more
                        long-term perspective. Someone seriously contemplating war against the
                        Soviet Union did not require a large amount of weapons, a high degree of
                        adventurism would suffice. And that was China’s policy. The Soviet Union
                        wanted better relations with China and regretted their absence. The
                        Secretary should not think that the Soviet Union was automatically hostile
                        to China. It wanted good relations, but not at U.S. expense.</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, in the past, when Soviet relations with China were good, there
                        had not been even one instance when this was turned against the United
                        States, there had not been even a single joint action against the United
                        States. He suggested that this constituted food for thought, not only on the
                        Soviet side, but also on the U.S. side. The Secretary would be utterly
                        amazed if <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> were to tell him
                        about some ideas previously advanced by China. He asked the Secretary to
                        understand his comments correctly.</p>
                    <p>Following a five-minute break the Secretary said that he wanted to make some
                        brief general observations about China and assured <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that he was very familiar with the
                        exchanges in Moscow on the subject. We were not conducting our affairs with
                        China with the intention of affecting our relationship with the Soviet
                        Union. The Secretary rejected the views on this score expressed by U.S.
                        commentators. He wanted to assure <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that this did not underlie our relation<pb n="300" facs="0331" xml:id="pg_300"/>ship with China. We considered that our
                        relationship with a billion of the world’s people was in the long-term
                        interest of the U.S., both in a global and in a regional sense. There
                        remained a number of controversial key issues, and we still had more
                        differences with China than points of convergence. But we did not let this
                        affect normalization.</p>
                    <p>As far as the military aspect was concerned, the Secretary noted that he had
                        made his first visit to China before President Nixon’s trip.<note n="9" xml:id="d90fn9">In January 1972, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> traveled to Beijing to meet with Chinese Prime
                            Minister Chou En-lai in advance of Nixon’s visit the following month.
                            For the memorandum of this conversation as well as <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s report back to <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, see <ref target="frus1969-76v17#d183">

                        but we have not done so. This development was only in an evolutionary sense,
                        and during the Secretary’s talks in Peking there was merely a change in
                        terms of the category in which China was included with respect to U.S.
                        foreign military sales. There had been no agreement to sell anything. We
                        intended to look at this on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary also had to add that China had full entry to the Western
                        European arms market. He recalled that in 1975 and 1976 Chinese
                        representatives went all over Western Europe, notably to France and Great
                        Britain, but had not procured much. There were several reasons for this, one
                        of them being their shortage of resources. As the Secretary saw it, under
                        the current Chinese development program it continued to have a shortage of
                        funds for weapons procurement. The Secretary understood the problem which
                        the Soviet side saw with respect to Chinese military forces. He wanted to
                        assure <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that we would not take
                        leave of our senses on the matter of the China problem. On the other hand,
                        it was in our interests to maintain a good relationship, and from time to
                        time to express concern about events which could have potential
                        ramifications in terms of our interests and international peace.</p>
                    <p>In this context, the Secretary had to say that our policy would be influenced
                        by whether or not actions corresponded to international behavior. The
                        Secretary had wanted to say this because of the distinctly real possibility
                        of a misreading of our relationship with China, especially in terms of arms.
                        Our purposes were peaceful and constructive.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> responded that he had honestly
                        presented the Soviet side’s views regarding its concern in the hope that the
                        U.S. would understand the Soviet Union and would see the entire problem of
                        the U.S.-Chinese relationship from the standpoint of the long-term
                        historical perspective. This involved the fundamental interests of the
                        Soviet Union and the United States in the world.</p>
                    <pb n="301" facs="0332" xml:id="pg_301"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he found <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s comments today about Cuba sterile and <hi rend="italic">pro forma</hi>.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> responded that he could not
                        believe a U.S. concern regarding the weapons which the Soviet Union supplied
                        to Cuba. The concept of defensive weapons certainly existed and the weapons
                        supplied by the Soviet Union were of a class that was defensive within the
                        defensive category, nothing more. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> could not seriously accept a U.S. concern regarding
                        Soviet arms deliveries to Cuba. If the U.S. side had no other concerns, it
                        had no concerns at all, it did not have a worry in the world. It was not
                        Soviet arms in Cuba that were of interest to the U.S., it was Cuba
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>There was a proverb regarding a needle in a haystack, but with present
                        technology, one could even find a needle. The U.S. had frequently spoken
                        about verification, especially in the context of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. It had voiced suspicions regarding various actions.
                        Apropos of such suspicions, if a country were to force the path of engaging
                        in such actions, it would have to recognize that at present no country could
                        not but be compromised. What was occurring in the U.S. today was that Mr. X
                        talked to Mr. Y and then Mr. Y spoke to Mr. X, after which both of them
                        separately and together voiced their fears to Mr. Z. Gromyko wanted to
                        express one more desire. The Secretary could take it into account or not, as
                        he preferred, but <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> suggested
                        that the U.S. give up on the contrived assertions regarding Cuban weapons.
                        Somebody had stepped on the tail of a magpie and the latter mentioned
                        something about Soviet scheming supposedly aimed against the U.S. What was
                        the purpose of all this? Serious people could not take such contrived
                        assertions seriously and repeat them. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> thought that the matter did not deserve any further
                        comment.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> also wanted to comment on one
                        further question, though he had already touched on it in passing. Statements
                        made in the U.S. frequently referred to U.S. vital interests. One could gain
                        the impression that the U.S. was laying claim not only to every corner of
                        the land mass of the globe, but also to the oceans. Wherever one looked,
                        inevitably there seemed to be some U.S. national or vital interest. This
                        pertained to the Indian Ocean, the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean, the
                        Caribbean, to Latin America; everywhere, with the possible exception of the
                        Socialist states, there were vital U.S. interests. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> asked rhetorically what would
                        happen if the Soviet Union or any other major country were to make
                        statements along these same lines. He repeated, what would happen then? What
                        would happen if the vital interests of one nation were superimposed on the
                        vital interests of another nation, and then on those of a third nation? This
                        would be a dead-end street. This would be true even if just one or two
                        states were to claim vital interests everywhere. No country, no side could
                        make such claims, and no one could accept them.</p>
                    <pb n="302" facs="0333" xml:id="pg_302"/>
                    <p>But at present it appeared as if the U.S. was trying to stretch some kind of
                        cover over the entire world, with the possible exception of the Socialist
                        countries. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> hoped that he had
                        shown that no country, including the Soviet Union, could accept what was
                        being said in Washington about U.S. vital interests. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to give an illustration and
                        asked the Secretary to understand him correctly. The U.S. had spoken about
                        the importance it attached to the Persian Gulf region. The U.S. had a naval
                        presence there because it perceived perfidious plans to interrupt the oil
                        trade. This has been said repeatedly. Supposedly the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was prepared to jump on the Persian
                        Gulf. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> urged the Secretary not
                        to believe tales about such a truly olympic jump. The Secretary, a statesman
                        responsible for formulating policy, had to be above that sort of thing. If
                        there was a jump, it was in the minds of those who spread such rumors. Such
                        statements constituted a derivative from the overall global concept. The
                        fact was that the Soviet Union had no such designs on the Persian Gulf.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to assure the
                        Secretary—and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was authorized
                        to give such an assurance—that no Soviet threat to the Persian Gulf or any
                        other area of the world had existed in the past or existed at present. He
                        went on to say that the U.S. should happily buy all the oil it wanted in the
                        area. There was no point in saturating the Persian Gulf or the Indian Ocean
                        with ships, aircraft and guns. The Soviet Union had no intention of
                        encroaching upon anyone’s riches, and the U.S. should cast aside all fears
                        of the Soviet Union. This was a contrived conception, one with huge and
                        fearful horns that should be forgotten because it was nonexistent. The
                        Secretary should cast it out of his mind.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that we had discussed
                        a number of issues. From his standpoint today’s talk had been beneficial. He
                        wanted to note that the Soviet side did not cast its words lightly to the
                        winds. He had frankly expressed the views of the Soviet side in the hope
                        that the Secretary, the President and the Administration as a whole, would
                        take into account and weigh what had been said, hopefully drawing the
                        appropriate conclusions. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had
                        spoken frankly and appreciated the Secretary’s frankness. We ought to
                        conduct our business in a serious way and not fall victim to emotions. The
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the U.S. lived in the same
                        house, admittedly not a glass house, but one which was no longer as big or
                        as invulnerable as it had seemed a hundred or two hundred years ago. The
                        Soviet Union hoped that the U.S. was prepared to put Soviet-U.S. relations
                        back on track.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he was grateful to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> for these observations. He wanted to remind the
                        latter that the issue of Cuba and its arms was a central regional matter, it
                        was not insignificant. The Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> to recognize this in assessing his comments. As <pb n="303" facs="0334" xml:id="pg_303"/>for verification, it involved both
                        reality and perceptions. We had obtained firm evidence from Southeast Asia,
                        from Laos and Kampuchea. We were hoping for serious reply in connection with
                        the event in Sverdlovsk in 1979, and with regard to the call for a meeting
                        under Article V of the Convention on Biological Weapons. However, we have
                        been faced by a stone wall; we had encountered negative responses.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary wanted to make some very brief comments on the Madrid <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> Conference.<note n="10" xml:id="d90fn10">Reference is to the Second Follow-up Meeting to the Conference on
                            Security and Cooperation in Europe in Madrid, which began in November
                            1980 and lasted until September 1983.</note> It would terminate soon, it
                        had to. We had advanced some confidence-building proposals and hoped that
                        this matter could be resolved at the fall session. We hoped that we would be
                        able to arrive at some arrangement for a continuation of discussion of
                        Basket Three subjects after the Madrid Conference. This involved political
                        reality in the U.S. Should there not be at least some progress on this
                        score, the climate for improving relations between us would be complicated.
                        This was important in terms of our ability to improve the dialogue.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that as he understood it was traditional at such meetings
                        as this to make special requests regarding certain individuals. The
                        President had asked him to mention one particular case. As we understood it,
                        Anatoliy Shcharanskiy was grievously ill and might die. The Secretary hoped
                        that Soviet authorities might give this matter some important consideration.
                        While the Secretary did not frequently make such requests, he also wanted to
                        mention the names Skuodis, Stolar, Chmykhalov, Vashchenko and <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shcharanskiy</persName> was a most critical issue in the U.S.<note n="11" xml:id="d90fn11">References are to Vytauta Skuodis, a Lithuanian
                            dissident; Abe Stolar, a dual Soviet-American citizen; and the
                            Chmykhalov and Vashchenko families, who were Soviet Pentecostalists
                            living in the basement of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.</note>

                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> replied that although
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shcharanskiy</persName> was known in the
                        U.S., he was not known in the Soviet Union. This was a little man, a little
                        criminal who was serving time. In the U.S. he was a political figure, in the
                        Soviet Union he was a nobody. He was even a nobody in the criminal world.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to state from the
                        outset that <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shcharanskiy</persName> was a
                        criminal. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was not sure he had
                        understood what the Secretary wanted with respect to <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName> was an academician, known as a scientist. As for
                        the other names, he did not recognize them.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> would provide <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s representative with a list.</p>
                    <pb n="304" facs="0335" xml:id="pg_304"/>
                    <p>The Secretary added these cases were of very great significance to the
                        President as a manifestation of an improved dialogue. On top of that, this
                        was a matter of great interest to a number of Congressmen and Senators,
                        especially the case of <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shcharanskiy</persName>.
                        Regarding <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName>, there was
                        widespread concern in the U.S. over his welfare, and we hoped that concern
                        would be heeded.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that U.S. Congressmen
                        would frequently visit the Soviet Union and then would gingerly reach into
                        their pockets and pull out a list of two, five or ten names. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would promise to check, and in 90
                        percent of the cases, he learned that the petitions were without foundation.
                        The individuals concerned had never filed any applications to leave, have
                        never indicated any desire to leave, in fact, had married and were living
                        quite happily. Thus, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> could do
                        nothing and had to explain honestly the real situation. In short, as he
                        understood it, the Secretary was hoping for these “Soviet exports.” Told by
                        the Secretary that Chmykhalov and Vashchenko involved individuals at the
                        U.S. Embassy in Moscow, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said
                        that he had heard about this case and thought that the Embassy should
                        release these individuals. The U.S. Embassy was involved in blackmail.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> assumed that these
                        individuals had already consumed all the bread and all the nuts at the
                        Embassy. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> added that the
                        matter could be considered once the individuals left the Embassy. He thought
                        that the Secretary should give some good advice to the Embassy, namely, put
                        the prestige of the U.S. above the prestige of the Embassy.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that this was like the chicken-and-egg situation, and
                        hoped the Soviet side would reconsider its position.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary expressed the view that our discussions had been helpful and
                        trusted that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> shared this
                        assessment. He was wondering whether it might be useful to hold a further
                        meeting shortly after the beginning of the New Year. If <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> agreed, he was willing to meet in
                        Vienna on a date to be agreed. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> inquired whether the Secretary meant Vienna or
                        Geneva. The Secretary said that he would be happy to meet in either city.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> called the proposal
                        acceptable. The Secretary inquired which city <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> preferred. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> suggested that Geneva might be preferable since it
                        had been the site of such meetings more frequently. The Secretary agreed to
                        hold the meeting in Geneva.</p>
                    <p>At this point the members of the two delegations joined the meeting.</p>

                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that he and the Secretary
                        had touched on many important problems of U.S.-Soviet relations and the
                        international situation generally. They had continued the discussions of
                        September 23.<note n="2" xml:id="d91fn2">See <ref target="#d88">Documents
                                88</ref> and <ref target="#d89">89</ref>.</note> It would probably
                        be necessary to get in touch again through diplomatic channels before talks
                        begin at the end of November to deal with procedural and organizational
                        questions, unless by a stroke of genius someone had an idea on substantive
                        matters. That is, if either side wished to say anything, this could be done
                        through diplomatic channels, unless other forms of contact were made
                        earlier.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> asked when Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> would be going to Moscow
                        and whether he had already submitted to “interrogation and execution by
                        Congress.” The Secretary replied that <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName>’s confirmation was over, and that he had passed with
                        flying colors. <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> said he
                        planned to be in Moscow October 16. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> expressed satisfaction, noting that the Embassy had
                        been without a captain too long. The Secretary reiterated that <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> had been handpicked, as one of our
                        most distinguished professionals. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said he knew that: they had met many times,
                        particularly on strategic arms limitations questions, in many latitudes and
                        longitudes, though more in latitudes than in longitudes.</p>
                    <pb n="306" facs="0337" xml:id="pg_306"/>
                    <p>Turning to bilateral questions, the Secretary suggested that rather than
                        discuss them in depth today we ask our diplomatic representatives in
                        Washington and Moscow to follow up on them. He agreed there had been a great
                        deal of investment in building them up, much sweat had been expended, to use
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s term, and that it would
                        be a tragedy to cast it aside. Related questions had been discussed earlier.
                        Concerning our bilateral agreements, five were coming up for renewal this
                        year in one form or another: medical science, environment, world oceans,
                        artificial heart and maritime. He was optimistic on the world oceans
                        agreement. On the artificial heart, he personally favored it, because he
                        might need one.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> asked if there was anyone in
                        the room who had signed the artificial heart agreement. <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> said he had negotiated it, and the
                        Under Secretary noted that he had been present. “But I signed it,” said
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d91fn3">The Agreement on Artificial Heart Research and
                            Development was signed on June 28, 1974, and entered into force the same

               </p>
                    <p>With regard to the cultural agreement, the Secretary went on, the situation
                        was somewhat different. There were problems with it for reasons of which
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was aware. On the other
                        hand, we thought that absence of an agreement should not interfere with
                        privately sponsored exchanges, and that would continue to be our position
                        until the larger problem was solved.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said the matter of the
                        cultural agreement was both simple and not simple. His fellow citizens found
                        themselves in danger. They did not feel comfortable in the U.S.; they felt
                        that their security was not assured. Steps should be taken to provide the
                        necessary conditions. The Secretary said no one here welcomed dangers to
                        Soviet citizens, and we should talk about this.</p>
                    <p>Generally, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said, five
                        agreements were due to expire in the next six months, and several more next
                        year. He trusted we were not burying them. The Secretary replied that each
                        agreement is distinct. The Maritime Agreement, for instance, was coming up
                        in the period ahead. We needed some adjustment of the text, and wished to
                        renegotiate it. It was related to the long-term agreement on grains, which
                        has been extended for the interim, and grains were under discussion now. The
                        President felt that he wished to move on grains as a matter of policy, not
                        to speak of mutual benefit. The Maritime Agreement would expire at the end
                        of the year and will take a lot of work. We would not want an interim
                        extension of the current agreement, because the balance of benefits has been
                        against us. On oceans, he repeated, he <pb n="307" facs="0338" xml:id="pg_307"/>was optimistic. We approach the question of bilateral
                        agreements with the idea of extending, of adjusting them as necessary, not
                        of throwing them out the window.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> raised the question of air
                        traffic, would the boycott last long?<note n="4" xml:id="d91fn4">A reference
                            to the refusal of baggage handlers at New York’s <persName corresp="#p_KRT_1">John F. Kennedy</persName> International Airport
                            to service flights arriving on the Soviet airliner Aeroflot.</note>
                        Aircraft servicing, including baggage handling, was being provided by Soviet
                        personnel. This was not very civilized, as a form of gymnastics for the
                        Soviet Embassy personnel in Washington. The Secretary suggested it kept them
                        fit. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> replied it was a benefit
                        they were willing to do without if the American side would display a more
                        civilized approach. The Secretary said this was a matter we should look at
                        together, perhaps next week between Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> and Minister <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that he had given <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> a list of names of cases of special interest, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> would turn over our
                        latest representation list to First Deputy <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> after the meeting (NOTE: This was done.)
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> commented that the
                        Secretary was interested in increasing Soviet exports to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that the question of consulates had earlier been
                        discussed in diplomatic channels. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> interjected that it was the U.S. side which had
                        blocked on this issue, not the Soviet side. There was a building in Kiev. He
                        had not seen it, but he understood it was refurbished and comfortable. It
                        was standing idle. Naturally the Kiev authorities wished to use it. The
                        Soviets needed an answer. The Secretary said he hoped to return to the
                        question of consulates the next time they met. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said he hoped the approach would be positive, with
                        regard to the building as well. The Secretary concluded that the experts
                        could deal with it.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> asked if there were any other
                        questions to discuss. The Secretary said he would like to raise an idea, put
                        forward by U.S. businessman Don Kendall, of a joint <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> program with a panel of U.S. and Soviet experts, for viewing
                        in both countries. After <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> had
                        explained the concept to him, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        said “let’s take a look.” He asked if the Secretary had in mind a series, or
                        a single program. The Secretary said we should try it once. If it was
                        successful we could do it again. On the U.S. side, it would even have a
                        sponsor. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said we should look
                        into this.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that the space and energy agreements would expire in May,
                        the science and technical cooperation agreement in July. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> asked if the U.S. was inclined to
                        renew them. The Secretary said the answer was yes in principle, though how
                        it worked out would <pb n="308" facs="0339" xml:id="pg_308"/>depend also on
                        progress in other areas he had discussed. But, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> asked, was the U.S. thinking in the direction of
                        continuation? The Secretary repeated that in principle, the U.S. was
                        thinking along these lines.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked how we should deal with the press. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that there would be no joint
                        statement. The Soviet side would not discuss details; it would say that many
                        questions had been talked about, including <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. (<persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>
                        interjected with a smile that if they could agree to resume <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> negotiations, then, of course, there
                        could be a joint statement.) <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        said each side would make its own statement, and the Soviets would say that
                        in general the meeting was a continuation of previous discussion, that they
                        had talked about bilateral and international issues, that the Soviets had
                        stressed their interest in resolving international problems, especially
                        those of peace and security, and bilateral problems that required
                        settlement. They would not go into details and would not list problems
                        discussed. It would be half a page, unless of course they agreed to begin
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> negotiations in October.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked what we should say about the agreement to continue
                        discussions after the first of the year in Geneva. Perhaps we did not need
                        to mention the place. <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName>
                        suggested it would be useful to contact the Swiss first. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> pondered how to formulate the
                        answer and suggested “the exchange of views at the ministerial level on
                        questions of mutual interest will be continued early next year.” The
                        Secretary agreed, and proposed that the sides go to the Swiss soon. Pending
                        that, we might say in response to questions that we would meet at a place to
                        be mutually agreed. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> replied
                        that we should not beat around the bush, and if asked should say “perhaps in
                        Geneva.” The Secretary agreed.</p>

                        position. We will need an <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting
                        within a month on the negotiating position we develop.</p>
                    <p>In their 1979 decision, the Allies agreed to a modernization program that is
                        on track everywhere except in the Netherlands. The Germans, Brits, Italians,
                        and Belgians have all shown great courage. Schmidt and <persName corresp="#p_GHD_1">Genscher</persName> have both threatened to resign on
                        this issue, even though they face substantial pressures, including the
                        250,000 protesters who marched in Bonn this weekend. We have had increased
                        concern about the Dutch, but in my meeting in Egypt with Dutch Foreign
                        Minister Talboys, I was assured that the Dutch would not withdraw their
                        deployment decision, but only undertake a necessary delay in reaching a
                        decision.</p>
                    <p>In 1979, the Allies also agreed to <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> arms
                        control negotiations, and we agreed to consult closely with our Allies. The
                            <gloss target="#t_IG_1">IG</gloss>, which State and <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> co-chair, with major <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> participation, has undertaken extensive
                        work on these issues. The Alliance consultations are important because the
                        primary purpose of the negotiations is political, i.e., to update the <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> modernization program. An actual arms
                        control agreement is secondary and has little prospect because of the
                        imbalance of forces. <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s Special
                        Consultative Group, the <gloss target="#t_SCG_1">SCG</gloss>, is the forum
                        for these consultations. It is chaired by Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> and will be meeting next on
                        October 26.</p>
                    <p>Let me summarize where we stand in the <gloss target="#t_IG_1">IG</gloss>.
                        There is general agreement that: (1) we will propose a phased, comprehensive
                        approach that seeks reductions to the lowest possible levels on land-based
                            <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> missiles in the first phase; (2) we
                        will insist on equal limits for like systems, and these limits must be
                        global; (3) we will negotiate only U.S. and Soviet systems and will not even
                        compensate for these Allied systems—a point we may need to reconsider; and
                        (4) we will insist on stringent verification procedures that will almost
                        certainly go beyond National Technical Means (<gloss target="#t_NTM_1">NTM</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>More specific elements include <gloss target="#t_IG_1">IG</gloss> agreement
                        that: (1) Soviet SS–20’s, 4’s, and 5’s must be limited, and that there must
                        be also constraints on shorter systems, including SS–21’s, 22’s, and 23’s;
                        (2) warheads on launchers will be the unit of account; (3) we want to ban
                        refires; and (4) we will not negotiate aircraft in the first phase, but may
                        be required to discuss them in the first phase because of Soviet claims
                        concerning the balance. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> threw
                        the aircraft balance issue at me in our <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        talks.</p>
                    <p>Issues remaining to be resolved include: (1) the TNF–<gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>) relationship, which is as yet undefined. As the talks go
                        on, they will merge.</p>

                        one area and could be dragged into that issue through the other forum.</p>

                        line.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName>:</hi> We
                        might remind the President that our Chief negotiator for <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> will be <persName corresp="#p_NPH_1">Paul
                            Nitze</persName>, and that for <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>,
                        it will be General <persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Ed Rowny</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi> We favor having the two negotiations in the same
                        location to facilitate coordination.</p>
                    <p>Other issues remaining to be resolved include: (1) levels of reductions,
                        i.e., ceilings and floors; (2) limits on shorter-range missiles; and (3)
                        verification issues. We need to study each of these issues in-depth.
                        Verification could be the most controversial issue for the Allies. We must
                        avoid an Allied perception that we are scuttling the talks at the outset by
                        insisting on verification criteria the Soviets are unlikely to accept; we
                        must treat the Allies gingerly on this matter. In general, the Allies have
                        been supportive on our approach.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>:</hi> We at Defense agree with many of the
                        points made by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>: (1)
                        the emphasis on land-based missiles, including SS–20’s, 4’s, 5’s, 21’s,
                        22’s, and 23’s; (2) banning refires; (3) omitting aircraft in any first
                        phase; (4) stringent verification procedures; and (5) Alliance
                        consultations.</p>
                    <p>There is, however, another point we would also like to bring out. It is the
                        question of what we would like to achieve in these negotiations. We are
                        conscious of several difficult dilemmas. If we are perceived as not engaging
                        in serious negotiations, our modernization program will not go through. If
                        we succeed in reaching only a cosmetic agreement, our modernization program
                        will also come to a halt, being perceived as no longer necessary. Or if we
                        are viewed as not making progress in negotiations, the Soviets will make it
                        seem to be our fault, and our modernization program will be endangered.</p>
                    <p>We need to assess the nature of our tasks brought on by the strength of
                        Soviet programs. They have 750 SS–20 warheads now. The SS–20’s are mobile,
                        accurate, powerful, hard to find and to hit, and they are targeted against
                        all of Europe and against China and Japan. The U.S. has no counter. In
                        addition, a new generation of Soviet shorter-range systems is on the way. We
                        may find our 1979 <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> modernization program
                        to be insufficient.</p>
                    <pb n="313" facs="0344" xml:id="pg_313"/>
                    <p>In this light, we might need to consider a bold plan, sweeping in nature, to
                        capture world opinion. If refused by the Soviets, they would take the blame
                        for its rejection. If the Soviets agreed, we would achieve the balance that
                        we’ve lost. Such a plan would be to propose a “zero option.” Initially, it
                        would, of course, be limited only to long-range land-based missiles, in
                        which the Soviets are preponderant. If it were ultimately decided to adopt
                        this option, it should be proposed by the U.S. in a spectacular Presidential
                        announcement, not at the mid- or lower-level <gloss target="#t_SCG_1">SCG</gloss> on October 26 or in terms of some “lowest possible numbers”
                        formula. The “zero option” should be considered carefully here, and no parts
                        of it should be given away at the October 26 <gloss target="#t_SCG_1">SCG</gloss>. We should not be using the “lowest possible numbers”
                        formula at the <gloss target="#t_SCG_1">SCG</gloss> or in any other forum.
                        —If we adopt the “zero option” approach and the Soviets reject it after we
                        have given it a good try, this will leave the Europeans in a position where
                        they would really have no alternative to modernization.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> Do we really want a “zero option” for
                        the battlefield? Don’t we need these nuclear systems? Wouldn’t it be bad for
                        us to give them up since we need them to handle Soviet conventional
                        superiority?</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi> The “zero option” will not be viewed as the
                        President’s initiative. It has already been proposed by the German Social
                        Democrats and by Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GHD_1">Genscher</persName> in Moscow, and it is a subject of intense debate in
                        Europe. There are also some serious problems with any “zero option.” We
                        should be looking for the hooker and must study this issue fully. What would
                        happen in one or two years when it comes time to deploy, if we have a “zero
                        option” on the table? With such an option, the Europeans will surely reject
                        any new deployments.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>:</hi> The Soviets will certainly reject an
                        American “zero option” proposal. But whether they reject it or they accept
                        it, they would be set back on their heels. We would be left in good shape
                        and would be shown as the White Hats. As to the nuclear battlefield systems
                        we need, we would not be including these shorter battlefield systems, e.g.,
                        the Enhanced Radiation Weapons (<gloss target="#t_ERW_1">ERW</gloss>)
                        systems, only the longer-range ones. Also, we would be insisting on
                        stringent verification criteria and on dismantling.</p>

                        We support <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> negotiations. I think it’s
                        important to gain Allied confidence so we can proceed with the modernization
                        program. We agree with the outline presented by Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>. However, we have two concerns at present. First,
                        on the reference to warheads-on-launchers as the unit of account. We may
                        want to count warheads-on-missiles instead. We will need to study this
                        further. Secondly, and this is a major concern, we do not want the reference
                        to aircraft not being negotiated in a first phase to imply that aircraft
                        could be negotiated in a future phase. That would be a slippery and
                        dangerous slope. Aircraft are required for both nuclear and conventional
                        roles and involve other special consideration as well.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Mr. President,</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>Your letter of September 22<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2">See the attachment to
                                <ref target="#d85">Document 85</ref>.</note> contains thoughts
                        which, as you write, touch upon the future of the relations between our two
                        countries. I studied them carefully.</p>
                    <p>I noted, of course, the statements in your message regarding your readiness
                        to maintain a constructive and stable relationship with the Soviet Union,
                        adherence to the dialogue with it, and interest in peaceful resolution of
                        problems causing the international tensions. Those intentions can only be
                        welcomed. We are fully in favor of proceeding along such a path and, on our
                        part, have been constantly calling upon the United States to act in exactly
                        the same way.</p>
                    <p>We are convinced that a positive development of relations between the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> meets the interests not only of the Soviet and American
                        peoples; leveling off these relations, bringing them back on the road of
                        businesslike cooperation would facilitate lessening the dangerous level of
                        tension in the world and would give a real hope for resolution of many acute
                        international problems.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, to be frank, it is regrettable that a new attempt is made
                        in your letter to present the matter in such a way, as if the obstacle in
                        the way of improving Soviet-American relations and reducing the general
                        international tensions is the policy of the Soviet Union. In the
                        correspondence between us I already dealt in detail on the absence of any
                        basis for posing the question in such a way. And the fact that this thesis
                        is again present in your message does not make it any more convincing.</p>
                    <p>Nor any useful purpose is served either by the tendency discernable in your
                        message which suggests in one way or another a linkage between the prospect
                        of development in our relations with some sort <pb n="317" facs="0348" xml:id="pg_317"/>of modifications in the Soviet Union’s “behavior”. To
                        proceed on this premise is to steer clearly the whole matter toward a
                        deadlock.</p>
                    <p>We, Mr. President, just as many other countries, really have serious and
                        legitimate objections to raise with the United States and its policy.
                        However, we are against replacing the consideration of acute and outstanding
                        issues with mutual recriminations over the behavior of any party on the
                        international scene.</p>
                    <p>You are speaking in favor of taking mutually into account each other’s
                        interests. We are in favor of that, too. But no double standard here should
                        be allowed, whereby one side perceives its interests everywhere and in
                        everything, but any legitimate step on the part of the other side is
                        immediately portrayed as encroachment on those interests, as a desire to get
                        unilateral advantages. Abandonment by the United States of such a double
                        standard will in fact demonstrate readiness to heed the interests of the
                        other side and will be a good contribution to the cause of stabilization of
                        the world situation.</p>
                    <p>And, of course, each side possesses a sovereign right to have appropriate
                        relations with its allies and friends, and to render them necessary
                        assistance. Let me make a point, if we are to speak of our friends, they
                        threaten nobody. Some people do not wish, however, to leave them alone, but
                        left alone they must be.</p>
                    <p>Here is an example—the campaign against Cuba—a campaign that is constantly
                        being whipped up. Why, for what purposes, is this being done? One cannot be
                        serious in saying that Cuba can allegedly threaten the vital interests of
                        the United States. We call upon the United States not to aggravate the
                        situation around that country but to embark on the path of establishing
                        normal relations with Cuba.</p>
                    <p>If the US side is really prepared, as you, Mr. President, write, to seek
                        solutions to international problems through negotiations, there exist all
                        possibilities to start doing that.</p>
                    <p>Take, for instance, that same question about a political settlement of the
                        situation around Afghanistan. As is known, the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> Government has been consistently seeking such a settlement,
                        in whose context the question of the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from
                        Afghanistan would also be resolved.</p>
                    <p>Recently the Afghan leadership came forth with new proposals on a political
                        settlement. We support those proposals and regard them as a good basis for
                        reaching appropriate agreements without any prejudice to the security and
                        prestige of any country. Think about it.</p>
                    <p>Likewise, why should not the United States take, at last, an unbiased look at
                        what is going on in Kampuchea? Is it really that the American interests are
                        infringed there? How is it possible in pursuance of some expedient
                        calculations to try to play with the destiny of a <pb n="318" facs="0349" xml:id="pg_318"/>nation, which has, as it is, suffered a terrible
                        tragedy. It cannot be permitted that the leftovers of the Pol Pot regime
                        could again stage a bloodbath for the Kampuchean people.</p>
                    <p>And there is still another question—the one concerning the situation around
                        Egypt. Here too, there should be no outside interference. Nobody has any
                        right to tell the Egyptians how they must solve their problems. The
                        pressure, which is being brought to bear on that country and, in so doing,
                        on the adjacent countries, must be stopped.</p>
                    <p>As we have already stated to the US Government, the developments around Egypt
                        affect the security interests of the Soviet Union. Indeed, there is
                        approximately the same distance from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> border to Egypt, as from Boston to Chicago.</p>
                    <p>In your message you, Mr. President, mentioned as one of the factors poisoning
                        the political atmosphere “the campaign of anti-Americanism”, which is
                        allegedly waged by the Soviet Union. However, if anybody has the grounds to
                        bring a charge on account of the raging hostile propaganda, it has to be us,
                        the Soviet side. After all, not a day passes in the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> without ever new fabrications about the Soviet Union and
                        its policy being launched. What is more, the most active part in this
                        unseemly exercise is taken by many representatives of the
                        administration.</p>
                    <p>For instance, what about the incessant campaign about the so-called “Soviet
                        military threat”. All sorts of fantastic fables have been told in this
                        regard on our account.</p>
                    <p>And why did you, personally, Mr. President, recently need to state publicly
                        that the Soviet Union bases its policy on the calculation to score a victory
                        in the nuclear war?<note n="3" xml:id="d93fn3">Presumably a reference to
                                <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s news conference of
                            October 1, 1981, in which the President stated: “It’s very difficult for
                            me to think that there’s a winnable nuclear war, but where our great
                            risk falls is that the Soviet Union has made it very plain that among
                            themselves they believe it is winnable.” See <hi rend="italic">Public

                            p. 871.</note> Are you not aware of my repeated and clear statements—may
                        be somebody intentionally conceals them from you—that the nuclear war,
                        should it be unleashed, would turn out to be a catastrophe for the
                        mankind?</p>
                    <p>I stated on more than one occasion, for all to hear, that the Soviet Union is
                        against any nuclear strike, be it the first or not the first, massive or
                        limited. We are for totally precluding the possibility of using nuclear
                        weapons. This is, indeed, the thrust of our proposals set forth at the
                        current <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly session. This is
                        our firm and consistent position. It is in this spirit that we are striving
                        to educate also the entire Soviet people.</p>
                    <pb n="319" facs="0350" xml:id="pg_319"/>
                    <p>We are not the ones who entertain thoughts about winning a nuclear duel. We
                        believe such calculations to be an insanity.</p>
                    <p>Of course, we unmasked and will continue to unmask the calumny against our
                        country and our policy. As far as we are concerned, we are against the use
                        of unpermitted methods in conducting the polemics. We are in favor of a
                        quiet, businesslike and, if you will, respectful dialogue.</p>
                    <p>Your message quite correctly points out what danger for the mankind is
                        presented by the already existing nuclear weapons stockpiles as well as the
                        need for serious efforts to reduce the armaments. However, it is difficult
                        to match these thoughts with the program of a steep increase in the US
                        strategic forces that you have recently announced. After all, this program
                        in no way leads in the direction of the restraint, which you seem to be
                        advocating. No reasonable grounds for the adoption of such a program
                        exist.</p>
                    <p>The implementation of this program will mean placing the arms race into a new
                        spiral with all its consequences.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union never sought a military supremacy. But we simply cannot
                        permit the disruption of the military-strategic parity.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, a meeting between our ministers has recently taken place in
                        New York. In a certain sense its results are positive. I have in mind the
                        agreement reached to hold negotiations on limiting nuclear arms in Europe.
                        It is, of course, only the first step, and serious mutual work is yet to be
                        done in search of solutions that would equally meet the interests of the
                        Soviet Union and the United States and be consistent with the principle of
                        equality and equal security. We are prepared to engage in such a search and
                        would like to hope that the US side too will approach the negotiations in a
                        businesslike manner.</p>
                    <p>The most important question concerning the continuation of strategic arms
                        limitation negotiations remains open. Regrettably, neither your letter, Mr.
                        President, nor what was said by the Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">A. Haig</persName>, introduce, so far, clarity in the
                        US position in that respect.</p>
                    <p>These are the thoughts which I wanted to set forth in connection with your
                        letter. Let us hope that the exchanges between us will serve the cause of
                        establishing a better understanding on the key issues of Soviet-American
                        relations.</p>

                    <quote>
                  <p>• The first is whether we want to impede the construction of the
                            Siberian Pipeline. The consensus answer to that question seems to be
                            yes.</p>
                        <p>• The second question is to what extent can we get others—our Allies—to
                            agree?</p>
                        <p>• To what extent do domestic considerations weigh in determining our
                            decision?</p>

                        wonder if we could go back a bit? We have a new comprehensive analysis of
                        what the Soviets buy from the West in technology and the effects of these
                            purchases.<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">See <ref target="#d98">Document

                        without Western assistance (technology).</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName>:</hi> Is

                        The Soviets go about the acquisition of Western technology in a very
                        organized manner. They lay out what they need and identify where to go to
                        get it. As a result of an increased understanding of the effects of Soviet
                        acquisitions, I see a trend to substantial broadening of <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> rules and revised methods of control
                        to reduce their technology acquisitions. I believe these new findings will
                        isolate and highlight the technology transfer question as never before.</p>

                        investment funds and makes their choices easier.</p>

                        can’t do it alone. The question is have we worked in good faith with our
                        Allies to get their cooperation? And, if we don’t get their cooperation, at
                        what point do we (by unilateral embargo actions) simply cut off our nose to
                        spite our face and add to our own (economic) problems by not <pb n="322" facs="0353" xml:id="pg_322"/>selling—by depriving ourselves without
                        depriving them (the Soviets) as was the case with grain. Can we make alone a

He also forwarded an undated paper which
                            outlined the four options. Option IV reads: “The U.S. is most concerned
                            about major Soviet projects which contribute to Soviet production
                            capability and our Allies’ vulnerability to Soviet energy leverage
                            (e.g., West Siberian Pipeline). The U.S. will make a major effort with
                            other countries to restrict exports of equipment and technology for such
                            projects. Until this is worked out the U.S. will deny all technology and
                            end-use equipment exports for major projects while approving end use
                            equipment exports not for major projects.”</note> This option would
                        allow us to sell oil and gas equipment items on which there are not national
                        security controls. This policy is desirable because the majority of oil and
                        gas equipment not covered by national security controls is available from
                        other sources and unilateral U.S. controls would achieve little.</p>

                            Soviet production capability and our Allies’ vulnerability to Soviet

                            technology for such projects. Until this is worked out the U.S. will

                        is disagreement on how long it would take the Soviets to make up the
                        technology shortages that would result from U.S. controls. In an analysis
                        prepared for recent testimony, we found that with very few exceptions, we do
                        not have a U.S. monopoly. For example, <gloss target="#t_GE_1">GE</gloss>
                        compressors could be gotten elsewhere. Our Allies are generally unwilling to
                        go along with restrictions. Thus, we are caught in a position of telling our
                        companies they cannot get licenses, because our policy is to impede Soviet
                        production, but not licensing won’t impede them (the Soviets) because of
                        availability from other sources. Our sources say that 18–20 months will not
                        be required to come up with alternatives.</p>

                        implications for East-West relations and East-West trade, but requires a

                    <p>Second, the grain embargo. We saw a breakdown (in the embargo) elsewhere.
                        They (the Soviets) were getting it without our help, while our agriculture
                        here was in a tailspin.</p>
                    <p>We have to look at those two considerations. Even though it helps them, does
                        it help us as much or more than it helps them? If it is spelled out that

                        DOBRYNIN</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> delivered to the
                        Secretary the attached letter to the President from President <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2">Not
                            found attached; printed as <ref target="#d93">Document 93</ref>.</note>
                        He said that the letter made <pb n="330" facs="0361" xml:id="pg_330"/>the
                        point that the Soviets felt the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> talks in
                        New York had been useful. Actually <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        was personally more positive in his assessment of the talks than the letter
                        was.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Afghanistan:</hi> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        why it was that the Japanese had gotten a different picture of the Soviet
                        position on Afghanistan than he had gotten from <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> said
                        this was especially true in the use of the term self-determination.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> that what was happening in
                        Afghanistan was essentially irreversible whereas in talking to the Japanese
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> told the Japanese that
                        self-determination could happen. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> asked which was the Soviet position. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> responded that the position was as
                        described by the Japanese, that self-determination could happen. He
                        explained that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had felt
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> used the term in the
                        context of negotiations over Afghanistan whereas in his talks with the
                        Japanese the term was used in the context of guarantees and the withdrawal
                        of Soviet troops. After that withdrawal, self-determination was
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had gotten the impression that
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> referred to the possibility
                        of expert level talks on Afghanistan. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> said this was incorrect. What he said was that he would
                        have our experts look at Afghanistan and then perhaps later we could talk
                        some more about it. In any case <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                        told him we would be prepared to discuss Afghanistan further in
                        February.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> then asked <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> if he had any comments on the
                        Angola issue (the chicken and egg and omelet issue as <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said). <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked how we intended to handle <persName corresp="#p_SJM_1">Savimbi</persName> whom we were supporting. The
                        Secretary said we were not supporting <persName corresp="#p_SJM_1">Savimbi</persName>. His support came from other sources. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked how in any case we intended
                        to handle him and the Secretary replied he thought we would just let the
                        Afghans [<hi rend="italic">Angolans</hi>] decide that. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> then asked if it was true that
                        there was talk of having an outside guarantee force as part of the
                        settlement and <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> said there had
                        perhaps been talk in the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> about that.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked why the U.S. was
                        so fixated with the Cubans in Angola and <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> replied it was the only way in which there would be
                        independence for Namibia. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        wondered what we had in mind about simultaneous withdrawal—would one date be
                        set for one side to withdraw and another date for the other side to
                        withdraw? <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> stated that this was
                        not accurate. The withdrawals would have to be concluded at the same time.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> wondered how this would
                        be achieved. The Secretary said that we would complete our talks with the
                        South Africans at which time we would get a date certain from them on
                        Namibia and then we would use another framework to get the same date in
                        respect to Angola. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> thought
                        this might be possible.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> stated that the Soviets also
                        would like to have a settlement in the Persian Gulf area, perhaps in the
                        context of an Afghan <pb n="331" facs="0362" xml:id="pg_331"/>settlement.
                        The Soviets might give some guarantees to some of the countries the U.S. is
                        interested in in the area.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> stated that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> was concerned by the belief of
                        President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> that the Soviets
                        think the Soviets could win a nuclear war. This led <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> to think that perhaps <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> thought he could win a nuclear war
                        and it worried the Soviet leadership. Turning to <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> encouraged an early move on
                        one or more narrower aspects of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> to
                        get momentum back to the arms control talks. (He did not mention any
                        specific aspect of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>.) The Ambassador
                        stated the U.S. arms buildup and recent strategic decisions were matters of
                        great concern to the Soviet leadership.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> thought it would be useful to
                        examine some specific areas where progress might be made. He thought that he
                        and the Secretary later in the fall might begin to talk about the agenda for
                        the next round of talks between the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. He said if he had some ideas he
                        would bring them to the Secretary. The Secretary said he thought this was a
                        good idea and we would do the same.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked how we
                        had handled the records of the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> meeting.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that we had done nothing with them
                        and that they had been very closely held. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said this was good and it was also what they had
                        done, but pointed out that the Politburo had read the <gloss target="#t_memcon_1">memcons</gloss> carefully.</p>

                    <p>14798. Subject: Initial Call on <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
                    <p>1. (C—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> received the Ambassador at
                        10:30 October 21 for his initial, courtesy call. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was accompanied by <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> Department Chief Komplektov and Viktor Sukhodrev, who
                        interpreted. The Ambassador was accompanied by the <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> and Pol Counselor. As customary and requested, the
                        Ambassador gave <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> a copy of the
                        statement he will make when he presents his credentials (text <pb n="332" facs="0363" xml:id="pg_332"/>below). <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that this would take place without delay and in
                        the next few days.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> asked if there was anything
                        the Ambassador wished to say and the Ambassador replied that the statement
                        which he had just handed over contained the principles which he would follow
                        in carrying out his mission. He had had long talks before leaving
                        Washington. He thought the talks which the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had in New York were a useful
                        beginning. The two sides had exchanged more-or-less well known views. He
                        hoped we could go forward from this, that we could proceed to discuss
                        specific issues and make some progress toward positive solutions to them.
                        The Secretary was looking forward to his next meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> early in the New Year.</p>
                    <p>4. The Ambassador said he knew from listening to Radio Moscow that there are
                        some doubts on the Soviet side about the willingness of the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> administration to negotiate
                        seriously on arms control and a large number of other issues. He could
                        assure <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that we are serious
                        and that he will find us prepared in the coming negotiations, and at the
                        next ministerial meeting, to discuss arms control, including strategic arms
                        control. The careful preparations which the U.S. side was making were
                        necessary in our system; <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was
                        a long time observer of the U.S. and he knew this. If we did not reach
                        agreement among the various groups which are interested and involved in arms
                        control matters, we would not be able to reach a good agreement in
                        negotiations. The Soviet side should welcome our careful preparations,
                        because when we reach agreement it will be one on which we can stand.</p>
                    <p>5. The Ambassador recalled that he had participated in the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> process and, speaking personally, he
                        thought that the disappointing results had come from waiting too long and
                        having missed times when we could have reached an agreement earlier. Perhaps
                        the sides had set their sights too high. If we had moved earlier, an
                        agreement would probably be in effect today. He looked forward to discussing
                        arms control issues with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and
                        also the other issues which had been raised by the Secretary in his meetings
                        with the Minister. He hoped that we could arrive at a better idea of how we
                        see those issues, and reach solutions for them.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said his attention was
                        drawn to what the Ambassador had said about the American side being prepared
                        for the meeting early next year. It would be good if the American side was
                        ready, because up to now it had not been prepared to touch upon the
                        substance of matters. This was apparent, and the Secretary had said so
                        directly in their meeting. If the U.S. side will be prepared on substance,
                        the Soviet side will be prepared, and that would be a small step in the
                        right direction.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said he would also not
                        question what the Ambassador had said to the effect that it could have been
                        possible, if both sides <pb n="333" facs="0364" xml:id="pg_333"/>had desired
                        it, to have prepared the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement
                        earlier. For its part, the Soviet side had done everything required of it to
                        cope with the tasks set before both sides in reaching agreement on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. But this was past and he would like
                        to hope that both sides would take that experience into account. Time does
                        not stand still. Talks should not be dragged out, but should come to
                        agreement. Practical conclusions should be drawn from past experience and
                        concrete agreements should be reached in the future.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said he believed the
                        Ambassador shared his view that Moscow, like Washington, is a place where
                        there is no lack of work for Ambassadors from major powers. This had always
                        been the case and would be so in the future. He welcomed the Ambassador as
                        an experienced diplomat who would find no lack of work in Moscow. This had
                        always applied equally for Soviet Ambassadors in Washington, and every one
                        of them felt he had quite enough work and a large field of it. He wished the
                        Ambassador every success in fulfilling his very responsible duties in
                        developing relations. He could always count on the cooperation of the <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss>, and other agencies and departments of the
                        Soviet Government. He would not be fettered by protocol or any other
                        limitation—not overly fettered, he should say. The door would always be open
                        at the Foreign Ministry.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> (after Komplektov whispered
                        in his ear) said he would take the opportunity to call attention to the
                        reply <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had given to a
                        question (on limited nuclear war) asked him by a <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> correspondent, which was published in that day’s issue of
                            <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>. The Soviet side would like to hope that
                        Washington will approach with all seriousness the reply <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> gave. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not wish to dwell upon this but he called
                        attention to it.</p>
                    <p>10. The Ambassador handed <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> the
                        relevant text of the President’s remarks to the out-of-town editors on
                        October 16,<note n="2" xml:id="d96fn2">For the text of <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s remarks at the October 16
                            briefing with out-of-town editors, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers:
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                     </hi>, 1981, pp.
                            947–960.</note> and said he hoped that after reading it <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would agree that the President had
                        not drawn the conclusions on nuclear war which <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>
                        attributed to him. As the President said, we do not believe that nuclear war
                        is winnable and we strongly oppose it, the Ambassador said. He looked
                        forward to discussing nuclear arms control with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> in the future. He hoped that, while awaiting
                        discussion on strategic arms control, we could proceed to discuss other
                        issues which the Secretary had raised in his meeting with the Minister.
                        Komplektov asked if the text of the President’s remarks which the Ambassador
                        had handed over was a clarification of what the President had said on the
                        16th, and when the <pb n="334" facs="0365" xml:id="pg_334"/>Ambassador
                        replied that it was the verbatim text of those remarks, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said he understood, that the text
                        which the Ambassador had given him was from the President’s meeting with the
                        “provincial press” (the original source).</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said he well recalled his
                        conversations with the Secretary. They were, of course, very useful, he
                        agreed, but the substance of matters was only ahead; those conversations
                        were only the beginning.</p>
                    <p>12. The Ambassador said <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                        letter to the President was appreciated for its expression of willingness to
                        continue the dialogue. Rising to end the conversation, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> replied that “we are in favor of
                        that.”</p>
                    <p>13. The conversation lasted 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>14. Following is text of the Ambassador’s credentials statement, a copy of
                        which was handed to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. Begin
                        text.</p>
                    <p>I have the honor to present Your Excellency the letter of credence by which
                        the President of the United States accredits me as Ambassador of the United
                        States of America to the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist
                        Republics. Together with this I present the letter of recall of my
                        predecessor, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WT_1">Thomas J. Watson,
                            Jr.</persName> It is both a professional and a personal honor for me to
                        present my credentials as the 17th Ambassador of the United States of
                        America to the Soviet Union. I come directly from service in a country with
                        whose government our ties span over two centuries to a country with whose
                        government we have had official contact for less than half a century. Yet
                        nobody can doubt that the bilateral relationship between the United States
                        and the Soviet Union is—and will remain for as far ahead as we can see—of
                        fundamental importance to the peoples of our two countries and to the
                        prospects of peace in the world.</p>
                    <p>The American and the Soviet people have much in common. Inhabiting a
                        continental land mass, we share a frontier spirit and a sense of pioneering.
                        We are hospitable peoples. We have never fought each other; indeed, we
                        fought side by side in a great World War.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, our relationship has always been fraught with complexity and
                        competition, and often with confrontation and hostility. We are divided,
                        perhaps irrevocably, by political systems which differ in basic and
                        immutable aspects. And we are divided—I hope not irrevocably—by attitudes
                        and actions which may arise from those basic differences in our systems.
                        Such divisions are particularly dangerous because they threaten global
                        stability and peace.</p>
                    <p>My government is fully committed to reducing those divisions. We are opposed
                        to sterile confrontations, to an arms race, to the absence of dialogue
                        between our governments. We will work for a constructive East-West
                        relationship, for genuine arms control, and for the resolution <pb n="335" facs="0366" xml:id="pg_335"/>of disputes by negotiation. But those
                        objectives can be reached only if each of us acts with restraint and in a
                        spirit of reciprocity. We Americans will do so. And we urge the Soviet Union
                        as well to review, in the light of these two factors, its policies and
                        actions in the world.</p>
                    <p>In these circumstances, your government will find us, Mr. Chairman, ready to
                        respect your status and your legitimate interests. You will find us ready to
                        conduct a serious dialogue on a wide range of important problems. The
                        agreement of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> and
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> to meet
                        early next year is, for our part, an expression of that readiness.</p>
                    <p>We are prepared to undertake with you a searching examination of ways to
                        resolve the major issues dividing us. We have specific approaches to these
                        issues—approaches which meet the legitimate interests of all parties. Let me
                        list some of them:</p>
                    <p>—We will enter the talks on theater nuclear forces next month in a positive
                        and constructive spirit.</p>
                    <p>—We are ready to begin <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> negotiations
                        during the first half of next year. We will approach them with good will and
                        with the conviction that they must be characterized by reciprocity.</p>
                    <p>—We have no wish for an expensive and dangerous arms escalation, but—in view
                        of a major and unprovoked Soviet program to build up its military forces—we
                        have no choice but to respond.</p>
                    <p>—When the Madrid meeting resumes next week, we will maintain our commitment
                        to a conference to consider significant and verifiable confidence-building
                        measures. And we remain convinced that progress in the military field must
                        be balanced by progress on human rights.</p>
                    <p>—We strongly believe that we both have a responsibility to refrain from
                        seeking unilateral advantages and from supporting—either directly or
                        indirectly—the use of force, subversion, or terrorism. Our obligation,
                        rather, is to work for moderate, lawful, and peaceful solutions in all areas
                        of the world, and to leave sovereign peoples free to determine their own
                        future.</p>
                    <p>—We believe the Soviet Union has a responsibility to deny support to Cuba for
                        its efforts directed against sovereign governments in Africa and Latin
                        America.</p>
                    <p>—On Kampuchea we urge the Soviet Union to persuade Vietnam to join an
                        international conference aimed at a political solution.</p>
                    <p>—In Southern Africa, we believe that our two countries should have common
                        objectives: an independent Namibia and an Angola free of outside involvement
                        or threat.</p>
                    <p>—And in Afghanistan, we should set as common goals: an Afghanistan which is
                        non-aligned, secure, and free of outside interference, and whose people are
                        free to chart their own course.</p>
                    <pb n="336" facs="0367" xml:id="pg_336"/>
                    <p>This is a difficult agenda, but we are convinced that it must be addressed in
                        a serious manner by both our governments. For our part, that is how we will
                        address it, because we are vitally interested in the peaceful resolution of
                        international tensions and in building a stable and constructive
                        relationship with the Soviet Union. If I did not personally share that vital
                        interest, I would not have participated in earlier high-level meetings
                        between our two governments, and I would not be standing here today. As
                        President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s representative to
                        your government, I pledge myself to the task of advancing our dialogue with
                        you—a dialogue which is indispensable to progress in our bilateral relations
                        and to enhancement of the prospects for peace. End text.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary met with a group of British businessmen visiting the United
                        States under the auspices of the Royal Institute of International Affairs
                        (Chatham House) to review US foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary opened by saying he had spent the day on <gloss target="#t_AWACS_1">AWACS</gloss>, an issue about which he remained
                        fundamentally optimistic. He suggested that with the Chatham House Group he
                        might usefully consider issues such as US nuclear policy, East-West
                        relations, Africa and the Middle East. The Secretary observed that the US
                        does have a foreign policy, one that is clear to all in the Administration.
                        This policy is built on four pillars, the first of which is to establish
                        better relations with the Soviet Union based on reciprocity and restraint on
                        Moscow’s part.</p>
                    <pb n="337" facs="0368" xml:id="pg_337"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">US-Soviet Relations:</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he had come away from more than nine and a half hours of
                        meetings with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  <note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2">See <ref target="#d88">Documents 88</ref>–<ref target="#d91">91</ref>.</note> with the broad impression that the
                        Soviets know what we want and do not like it. They are concerned by the
                        historically unique new attitude in America with regard to security issues,
                        the consensus that the United States has to improve the military balance
                        with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is dedicated to shattering the
                        agreement between the American people, Congress and the Executive Branch.
                        However, Moscow is not certain how to achieve this aim. Given its own
                        economic situation, the Soviet Union fears further expenditures on
                        armaments. Moreover, the Soviet policy is dedicated to the proposition that
                        there are fissures between the US and Europe. Moscow is preoccupied with the
                        nuclear genie and anxious to widen those fissures that have developed in the
                        Atlantic Alliance. Its aim is to neutralize the Atlantic community at
                        large.</p>
                    <p>However, the Soviet Union faces historic problems. These include a faltering
                        economy, as well as the over-extension of its international activity in
                        Africa and Afghanistan. The Soviets never anticipated the political and
                        psychological reaction of the world to their invasion of Afghanistan. The
                        evolution of events in Poland also must be seen as of fundamental
                        significance, along with problems of succession. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s health is very much in decline.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the above considerations must lead to a reassessment
                        on our part. Above all we must avoid a fragmenting dialogue between the
                        United States and Europe. He said that he was not concerned about US vigor.
                        Yet the US must not sound like an empty barrel. While it is important that
                        we speak with resolve, it is more important that we act with resolve. The
                        Soviets are never impressed by words. They judge by our allocation of
                        resources, and we have to be careful to assure that our rhetoric is not
                        meaningless.</p>
                    <p>In response to the Secretary’s suggestion that the Group pose questions,
                            Lord Harlech thanked the
                        Secretary for seeing the Group and suggested that his colleagues’ questions
                        concentrate on European-US relations and the Atlantic Alliance, as well as
                        the Middle East, Africa and China if time permitted. With regard to
                        US-European relations, Lord Harlech
                        noted the degree to which Europeans like to be reassured by arms reductions.
                        They prefer to feel that the United States is aiming at overall reductions
                        in nuclear weapons. Harlech asked if there had been any hint from <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that the Soviet Union was anxious
                        to indulge in serious negotiations in this regard.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Arms Control: <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>:</p>
                    <p>In response, the Secretary said the Soviet Union is very concerned about our
                        build-up and wants to avoid the burden of a further build-up. However, as we
                        look ahead, we see no indication of a letup by the Soviets. They are making
                        a fundamental reassessment as to whether they will have to build up their
                        nuclear capabilities even further. We have to get on with arms control
                        talks, the Secretary observed. These will be difficult talks within the
                        framework of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. Ceausescu of Romania
                        had just jumped in with a suggestion that the Soviets move their SS–20s in
                        response to Alliance concessions. Ceausescu’s proposal is a perversion of
                        the “Zero-Option”. Other nations would feel threatened by any Soviet move.
                        The Zero-Option is not something we are opposed to, the Secretary added,
                        providing that it reflects ideal conditions. The Soviets must dismantle all
                        their SS–20s. The benchmark for the present nuclear debate ought to be the
                        deployment by the Soviet Union of the SS–20s in Europe. We had been thinning
                        out our nuclear warheads and have withdrawn about 1,000 such warheads in
                        recent years.</p>
                    <p>With regard to <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, the Secretary said the
                        Soviets are extremely anxious to proceed. They wish to be relieved of the
                        armaments burden and desire to crack the US consensus on a military buildup.
                        The Secretary said that having lived through <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>–I himself, he was a little skeptical about the process.
                        However, we cannot afford not to proceed. We must go into the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> talks very carefully. Failure does not
                        serve Western interest, and at present the US is studying all possibilities.
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II did not break up on the rocks
                        of Afghanistan, as some would have us believe. It was killed by its own
                        substantive inadequacies and the skepticism about it that developed as a
                        result of these inadequacies. <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II was
                        a flawed treaty. It permitted an increase in heavy missiles and inordinantly
                        burdened our European partners. Our intensive review is designed to preclude
                        the possibility of a shock once negotiations begin.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Anti-Nuclear Sentiment: “Peace” Movements:</p>
                    <p>In response to a question about the demonstrations in Europe against nuclear
                        weapons, the Secretary said these are not pacifist/neutralist movements. The
                        underpinnings are more subtle. Frequently, the sentiments we see expressed
                        are based on religious and environmental considerations, as well as concern
                        for the peaceful use of the atom. One also notes the deep concern for their
                        own safety of people who would be directly affected. This concern is deep
                        and genuine. The old argument between Europe and the US is whether the
                        President of the US would sacrifice Washington for Hamburg. Now the argument
                        is that the US is not willing to sacrifice anything at all and, indeed, is
                            <pb n="339" facs="0370" xml:id="pg_339"/>setting Hamburg up for a
                        nuclear attack. This is a serious perversion of the truth, though an
                        understandable one. It provides ammunition for the East. We will find this
                        concern growing in the United States in the months ahead and there will be
                        increasing division here if it is not handled well. Thus, it is a common
                        problem that is shared on both sides of the Atlantic. Young people have to
                        know that their leaders are sensitive to their concerns, since no one can
                        expect a high level of sacrifice if we are not prepared to take their
                        concerns fully into account.</p>
                    <p>When asked about Soviet orchestration of so-called peace movements, the
                        Secretary noted that there is no question about Soviet involvement. He
                        recalled that the Soviet Ambassador in the Netherlands received the
                        Kremlin’s highest award for his role in the campaign against the <gloss target="#t_ERW_1">ERW</gloss>. However, we do ourselves a disservice if
                        we think that is all there is to it.</p>
                    <p>A member of the Chatham House Group observed that if there were less
                        ignorance about the imbalance between Soviet and <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> forces, there would be more understanding for an allied
                        build-up in Europe. The Secretary agreed. We have come a long way since he
                        had first gone to Europe as SACEUR. At that time he had found that Europeans
                        would not normally accept the idea of an imbalance or a threat. However, he
                        added that he is more concerned that if the issue is mishandled and
                        overdramatized, we will move the young from both sides of the Atlantic to
                        decide that it is better to be red than to be burned. This approach could be
                        a reality by 1985.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary was asked if he had heard from <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> about the possibility of the Soviet’s scaling down
                        their own military production and the problems that would be attendant to
                        such a move. The Secretary said that he was not very optimistic about
                        Moscow’s ability to scale down in the near term.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe:</p>
                    <p>With regard to a question on how events might unfold in Eastern Europe and
                        how the Soviet Union’s empire might evolve over the next decade, the
                        Secretary observed that the Soviets have profound problems in agriculture,
                        in education and with minorities. They are facing increasing centrifugal
                        pressures. Poland is not a Czechoslovakia or an East Germany. It is a
                        profound political event. The mother church itself is being challenged. We
                        see the independence of the labor movement, the collapse of internal law and
                        order, and a challenge to the political leadership in Poland. Some claim the
                        costs of a Soviet invasion now outweigh the benefits to the Soviets. Others
                        disagree. The truth is somewhere in between. It is clear that the challenge
                        to the Soviets is unacceptable to them, and what we are seeing today is
                        shaped by these challenges. The Secretary added that we have not seen the
                        end <pb n="340" facs="0371" xml:id="pg_340"/>of the Polish situation.
                        However, the contagion has not spread. Most other Eastern Europeans are
                        angry with the Poles. However, the situation in Poland ultimately will
                        affect Eastern Europe across the board. The Secretary said he would have to
                        give the Soviets fairly high marks for their handling of Poland. In their
                        terms they had been moderate and restrained, as has the West. They had had
                        several opportunities to invade in the past year and had prudently chosen to
                        miss all of them. An invasion would have led to a united West that would
                        have sent chills down the back of the Soviet Union. It appears that
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> himself restrained the
                        Soviet Union and nipped pressures for invasion in the bud.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Succession Issue in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>:</p>
                    <p>Responding to a question about <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s health and the succession issue, the Secretary
                        said that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> appears to be in
                        gradually declining health and that history shows us the Soviet system is
                        ill-prepared to handle succession problems. He would expect that a
                        collective leadership would govern initially, following the passing of
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> from the scene, with the
                        toughest and meanest member eventually assuming the reins in the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Afghanistan:</p>
                    <p>Turning to Afghanistan, the Secretary noted the interesting relationship
                        between the Soviet decision to intervene and the demographic changes in the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. The Soviet Union’s Muslim
                        population is exploding. The Secretary judged that related economic and
                        demographic problems were among the principal motivations for the invasion
                        of Afghanistan.</p>

                        economic problems and assesses how economic pressures can be put on the
                        Soviets. The Soviets now face serious problems in almost every sector of
                        their economy and their need for Western goods will grow in the 1980s. What
                        will contribute most to their ability to maintain their military buildup
                        are:</p>
                    <p>(1) Western plant and equipment to help on their severe productivity

                    <p>(2) Western oil and gas equipment to find new resources;</p>
                    <p>(3) specialty steels and large diameter steel pipe, pipe laying machinery and
                        compressors which will help meet their energy problems and which, coupled
                        with the commitment of financing and gas markets from Western European

                        TRADE</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Overview</p>
                    <p>As the Soviet Union completes the first year of its new five-year plan, the
                        economy has turned sour before the long anticipated labor and energy
                        problems have come into play. Three bad harvests have left agriculture in
                        disarray. Meanwhile, transportation and materials bottlenecks and smaller
                        productivity gains have reduced industrial growth sharply. Because prospects
                        for raising productivity are poor, <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>
                        growth may well be limited to 1–2 percent on average by the mid-1980s.</p>
                    <p>Slower economic growth will present President <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> and his colleagues with some increasingly tough and
                        politically painful choices regarding resource allocation and economic
                        management. Annual increments to national output in the early 1980s will be
                        too small to permit them simultaneously to meet mounting investment
                        requirements, to maintain growth in defense spending at rates of the past,
                        and raise the standard of living appreciably. Simply stated, something will
                        have to give.</p>
                    <p>Given their problems, the Soviet need for Western goods and credits will
                        increase greatly. Western imports would help planners deal with the basic
                        problems confronting the Soviet economy during the 1980s—declining
                        productivity and resource stringencies. Imports of Western plant and
                        equipment, though now only about 5 percent of total domestic investment,
                        make a disproportionately large contribution since their productivity is
                        substantially higher than Soviet-designed equipment. Large food imports will
                        be required to maintain consumer morale and encourage labor productivity
                        during the 1980s.</p>
                    <p>Soviet leaders, however, would be unlikely to change their foreign policy to
                        ward off a Western economic embargo. They do not believe such a course is
                        economically necessary, in part because they do not think—based on the
                        Afghanistan experience—that a comprehensive embargo can be implemented, much
                        less sustained for more than year or so. Moreover, changing Soviet foreign
                        policy to prevent an embargo <pb n="343" facs="0374" xml:id="pg_343"/>would
                        be viewed as appeasement and would undermine the position of anyone who
                        might recommend it.</p>
                    <p>If an embargo were implemented, however, a denial limited to US-origin
                        equipment, technology and foodstuffs would be disruptive only in the short
                        term; other Western and some East European products would be adequate
                        substitutes. Only if the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> were denied
                        access to most Western equipment and technology for an extended period would
                        the Soviet economy suffer substantial damage. Politically, the response
                        reaction to a full scale embargo is highly unpredictable. The Soviet
                        leadership, for example, might respond by taking an even more aggressive
                        stance internationally. They probably would see little positive incentive in
                        restraining their behavior abroad and might believe that foreign adventurism
                        could be used to rally support for the economic sacrifices and the greater
                        discipline that would be required at home.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Current State of the Soviet Economy</p>
                    <p>As the Soviet Union completes the first year of its new five year plan, the
                        economy has turned sour before the long anticipated labor and energy
                        problems have come into play. After averaging close to 4 percent during most
                        of the 1970s, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> measures of the average
                        annual rate of <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> growth fell to just 1
                        percent during 1979–80. Only a weak rebound is expected this year.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Agriculture</p>
                    <p>Agriculture has been Moscow’s biggest headache. The Soviets have now suffered
                        their third straight harvest failure. We estimate that the grain crop will
                        be about 170 million tons, 19 million tons less than last year’s poor crop.
                        Because meat production and the output of most other crops are expected to
                        exceed last year’s depressed level, however, total farm output should
                        increase slightly compared with last year. Nevertheless, output will still
                        fall short of the 1976 level.</p>
                    <p>While the odds are that the weather will be better next year, a return in the
                        coming decade to the unusually favorable weather patterns that existed from
                        the mid-60s to the mid-70s seems unlikely. Rather, the somewhat harsher
                        conditions that prevailed for 20 years prior to the mid-60s are likely to be
                        the rule. In this environment, the gains in agricultural output that accrued
                        between the mid-60s and mid-70s—largely the result of good weather—will be
                        nearly impossible to achieve in the 1980s unless there is a sharp reversal
                        of current trends in the delivery of machinery and fertilizer to
                        agriculture.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Industry</p>
                    <p>While agriculture has grabbed most of the headlines, industry also has been
                        doing poorly. More than halfway through 1981, growth in <pb n="344" facs="0375" xml:id="pg_344"/>almost every major sector is running behind
                        the pace of a year ago. Civilian industrial output grew by less than 2½
                        percent in first-half 1981 compared with first-half 1980. In the postwar
                        period, only the 1979 first-half showing was worse.</p>
                    <p>Lagging output of industrial materials is a major reason for the economy’s
                        malaise. An abrupt slowdown in the growth of the steel and construction
                        materials sectors (Table 1) has had a decided effect on new fixed
                        investment, while shortages of nonferrous materials, lumber, and paper have
                        become increasingly evident.</p>
                    <p>Growth of Soviet energy production also has slowed. After averaging almost 5
                        percent during most of the 1970s, primary energy production should fall to
                        less than 3 percent this year. Oil output has been almost stagnant for the
                        past year, while coal output—which peaked at 724 million tons in 1978—will
                        probably decline to 710 million tons this year. Only gas continues to do
                        well; the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> should have little trouble
                        in reaching its 1981 production goal of 16.2 trillion cubic feet. Meanwhile,
                        spot fuel shortages have become more frequent, reflecting a tighter supply
                        situation as well as distribution problems. Although the Soviets are
                        stepping up their efforts to increase the efficiency of energy use in the
                        economy, campaigns of this kind in the past have fallen far short of their
                        targets.</p>

                            (11/03/1981–11/05/1981). Secret. The President’s Daily Diary indicates

                    </list>
                    <p>We think the moment is right for you personally to launch a major offensive
                        on the issues of peace, security, and freedom. Building on <pb n="345" facs="0376" xml:id="pg_345"/>the recent success at Cancun and with
                        AWACs, your offensive would give a substantial lift to our diplomatic and
                        defense efforts both abroad and at home.</p>
                    <p>Above all, a Presidential initiative would help derail the Soviet campaign to
                        occupy the high ground on nuclear war and arms control in Europe. <hi rend="italic">The Soviets will be trying to add fuel to the fire which
                            has led to the recent wave of demonstrations. Specifically, during his
                            forthcoming visit to Bonn (Nov. 22–24), <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> may well announce an initiative designed to
                            attract European public support before the <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> negotiations begin November 30. We can and should
                            preempt him</hi>.</p>
                    <p>We have an excellent opportunity to repeat our success in ruining <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> speech. Coming just before <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s speech, the publicity on your last letter to
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> and my address to <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> left the Soviets in a heavy-handed and
                        confrontational posture. They were simply too rigid to react quickly enough
                        to change their gameplan. <hi rend="italic">I, therefore, recommend that you
                            deliver a televised address just before <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> arrives in Bonn</hi>. A forceful but positive
                        Presidential presentation will deflate <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> on the eve of his visit and put the Soviets on the
                        defensive.</p>
                    <p>It also could help here as it would come on the eve of Congressional votes on
                        funding for the MX and B–1. We need to undermine the growing attacks on our
                        defense program increases by demonstrating that they are essential to our
                        peace program, including the success of arms control.</p>
                    <p>Your speech would be explicitly addressed to the peoples of the world, and
                        would set forth our overall approach to peace, security and freedom. It
                        would concentrate on the nuclear issues now most at play in Europe. We would
                        seek to reeducate the Europeans about the basic requirements for security
                        and deterrence. We would stress that peace has been preserved for an entire
                        generation for certain basic reasons, above all by preserving deterrence.
                        The U.S. is now strengthening and modernizing its conventional, theater
                        nuclear and strategic nuclear forces to ensure that deterrence remains
                        intact. You would state that our <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>
                        program provides the essential link between the US strategic umbrella and
                        the security of Europe by deterring both Soviet conventional attacks and a
                        limited nuclear war in Europe. Building on the excellent statement you
                        released October 21st, you could stress the necessity for equality and
                        balance.</p>
                    <p>But you also would stress our desire to achieve these objectives at the
                        lowest possible level of forces. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> will want to hit hard in Bonn at our alleged
                        unwillingness to negotiate seriously. To preempt him, you would announce
                        that you have communicated to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> (via a letter Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> could present to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> on the eve of your speech) our <hi rend="italic">comprehensive program</hi> to achieve <hi rend="italic">equality at the <pb n="346" facs="0377" xml:id="pg_346"/>lowest
                            possible levels of strategic weapons and <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>. You would challenge <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> to agree</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Specifically on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, you would stress that
                        we have informed the Soviets that we will be ready to start talks by the
                        spring of 1982, and emphasize that we are using the time remaining to define
                        approaches which would go well beyond past <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreements in achieving substantial reductions.</p>
                    <p>You then would focus heavily on <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>. The
                        difficulties have started because the Soviets have been moving ahead
                        steadily with their deployment of SS–20s, while the United States actually
                        has decreased the number of its nuclear warheads by 1,000 over the past
                        several years. <hi rend="italic">With a graphic chart behind you to make the
                            point visually, you could stress that the number of Soviet <gloss target="#t_LRTNF_1">LRTNF</gloss> missile warheads continues to
                            increase while the U.S. at present deploys no <gloss target="#t_LRTNF_1">LRTNF</gloss> missiles. We are prepared to limit our deployments to
                            the lowest possible level to which the Soviets are willing to reduce,
                            ideally to zero</hi>.</p>
                    <p>You then could go on to state that deterrence and arms control are not
                        enough, that we not only want to preserve peace in Europe, <hi rend="italic">we want to help bring peace to other areas of the world torn by crises
                            and tension</hi>. Here too we have a concrete program for peace and
                        security. You then could <hi rend="italic">briefly</hi> review our
                        diplomatic efforts in various regions, and attack Soviet intervention and
                        aggression. And you could underline that we believe genuine peace and
                        security can unleash a new era of economic growth and individual liberty.
                        Here too we have programs and values which give us confidence in the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>Obviously we will need to fine-tune these ideas working closely with
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Cap</persName> and your staff. But I would
                        like your agreement to move ahead on the draft of such a speech and with
                        arrangements for you to present it on television November 20th. I am
                        convinced you can steal <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                        thunder and put us on the offensive.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation</p>

                        military confidence-building measures in Europe (<gloss target="#t_CDE_1">CDE</gloss>), balanced by human rights provisions that go beyond the
                        Helsinki Final Act of 1975. This gives us an opportunity to try to get some
                        people out of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Specifically, we
                        should seek release of <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shcharanskiy</persName>,
                        the jailed Jewish dissident and Helsinki monitor, whose wife you met, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName>, the exiled physicist
                        who has been critical of the Soviet regime. If this proves impossible, we
                        could settle for one or the other, or a larger number of lesser-known
                        dissidents.</p>
                    <p>The incentive for the Soviets to agree to this is that we, in turn, would
                        reduce somewhat our demands for language on human rights in the concluding
                        document at Madrid. We would thus achieve “balance”: in part by the
                        significant political—and humanitarian—symbolism of getting people released.
                        We would meet Congressional concerns that we won’t get enough out of Madrid
                        on human rights, and we would demonstrate that the Administration’s approach
                        to human rights produces more results than rhetoric.</p>
                    <p>I will raise this initially with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>; then, if the Soviets agree to talk, Ambassador Max
                        Kampelman will pursue it with his Soviet counterpart in Madrid. The
                        discussions would be kept totally secret. While we will resist any Soviet
                        effort to get a quid pro quo beyond the <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> context, we will tell them that this gesture would improve
                        the tone of our relationship.</p>
                    <p>This is a long shot, but well worth trying. I will of course keep you
                        informed of any developments.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary indicated that he had shown the non-paper on possible release
                        of Soviet dissidents to <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d101fn2">Attached but not

                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> had noted that <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName> does not want to leave the Soviet
                        Union and is happy to stay and create problems for the government. He asked
                        that we give him another name in <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName>’s place. The Secretary said that he had emphasized
                        that <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shcharanskiy</persName> was very important.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shcharanskiy</persName> had been a spy for the
                        Knesset, but otherwise raised no objection to his release. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked what was in it for Moscow if
                        they, in fact, released some dissidents. The Secretary noted that it would
                        ensure a positive outcome for the Madrid <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> meeting.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> then asked what
                        was happening in the Administration. He was concerned about <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Dick Allen</persName>’s article on detente.<note n="3" xml:id="d101fn3">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Richard Allen</persName>, “The Atlantic Alliance at a Crossroad,”

                        Secretary indicated that the article did not accurately reflect the
                        President’s views on US-Soviet relations. He wants the relationship back on
                        the track. The Secretary gave <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> possible dates for the Secretary’s next meeting
                        with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. He told him to pick two
                        days in the January 26–29 time frame. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> commented that it was important that the Secretary
                        be prepared to discuss <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> at that
                        time.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> then expressed his
                        concern about the Presidential speech on foreign policy. <persName corresp="#p_BLP_1">Bremer</persName> indicated that the White House had
                        promised us a draft by November 11. <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> commented that he had heard <persName corresp="#p_PR_1">Dick Perle</persName> had been involved in redrafting
                        our draft. He was quite worried and emphasized the need for us to win our
                        position on <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>Discussion then turned to the willingness of the Administration to be tough.
                        The Secretary related that in the previous day’s <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting,<note n="4" xml:id="d101fn4">The National Security
                            Council met on November 10 to discuss strategy toward Cuba and Central

                        there was significant opposition to any readiness to take military measures,
                        the Secretary said that if we were not willing to go all the way if need be,
                        we should not even start on that path. He then proposed that we immediately
                        open negotiations with Cuba.<note n="5" xml:id="d101fn5">An unknown hand
                            drew two vertical lines in the margin of this sentence and the final

                        believed that this had jolted the others and caused them to rethink their
                        positions. They were subsequently willing to be a bit tougher. The Secretary
                        noted that he had taken the President through an emotional and intellectual
                        meat grinder. The President had slept on it and judging from the Secretary’s
                        call to him this morning, he now appreciated yesterday’s meeting.<note n="6" xml:id="d101fn6">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> spoke to

                    <p>The Secretary then related the substance of his conversation with the
                        President, where the President expressed worry over the reception of his
                        press conference and the Secretary reassured him.<note n="7" xml:id="d101fn7">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s press conference of November 10. (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>

               </p>
                    <p>The Secretary gave a brief read-out on the morning’s meeting on East/West
                        trade at the Commerce Department. The bottom line of most of the
                        participants, i.e., <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_PR_1">Perle</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CWJ_1">Casey</persName>, is that anything that could in any way be helpful to
                        the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe was wrong. <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName> wants to review again the whole of East/West trade.
                        The Secretary commented that this was because <persName corresp="#p_ARV_1">Allen</persName> and <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> had lost on
                        all their arguments and that they found it difficult to accept such losses
                        even though the President made the decision. The Secretary commented that we
                        needed to get out-of-office help on this issue. We should call together a
                        group of non-government experts such as Billington, <persName corresp="#p_SB_1">Scowcroft</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Sonnenfeldt</persName> to review all the issues involved in East/West
                        trade and take recommendations. The basic question is should we go into
                        economic warfare as some in the Administration have argued.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> asked if we really had to
                        go through all the issues again and the Secretary replied in the
                        affirmative, and lamented that the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                        always tries to redo Presidential decisions with which it does not agree. He
                        commented that we should perhaps not engage in the interagency process any
                        more. The Defense Department has ceased to participate constructively. We
                        may just have to do everything on our <pb n="350" facs="0381" xml:id="pg_350"/>own from now on. <persName corresp="#p_BLP_1">Bremer</persName> gave the example that <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> and Commerce have refused even to comment on the papers we
                        had circulated relating to oil and gas technology exports.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Larry Eagleburger</persName> then raised the
                        need for the Secretary to call the West German Ambassador. <persName corresp="#p_GHD_1">Genscher</persName> had told the press that he had
                        asked his Ambassador to talk to the Secretary about the President’s
                        statements on nuclear war. <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> added that as well as reassuring the Germans we
                        should indicate that we have had enough of their bellyaching. The Secretary
                        lamented that the press seems to be trying to push us into a war of words
                        with Europe, and asked if those present had seen the way the press kept
                        harping on the nuclear statement in the Secretary’s press conference
                        yesterday.</p>
                    <p>At 3:00 pm the Secretary called <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>
                        Ambassador Hermes. He read the talking points which <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> had provided. He added that it
                        is also a burden in Europe for the leadership to speak out boldly on this
                        issue. The Secretary said that anyone who saw the President’s press
                        conference could hardly say that this was an effort to inflate the
                        issue.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Dependence of Soviet Military Power on Economic Relations With
                        the West</p>
                    <p rend="center">KEY JUDGMENTS</p>
                    <p>Acquisition of goods and technology from the West enhances Soviet military
                        programs in two principal ways: by making available specific technologies
                        that permit improvements in weapon and military support systems and the
                        efficiency of military and civilian production technology; and by providing
                        economic gains from trade that improve the efficiency of the economy and
                        thereby reduce the burden of defense. Soviet military power is based
                        fundamentally on the large size and diversity of the Soviet economy and the
                        breadth of the Soviet technical and scientific base, on Soviet success in
                        acquiring sophisticated technology in the West, and on the longstanding
                        preferred status of the military sector.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> recognizes that it will be hard
                        pressed to maintain its relative position in the technical sophistication of
                        its weapons compared with those of the West. Moscow will therefore continue
                        to seek Western technology useful for its future weapon systems by all
                        means, including those illegal means that have been successful in the past,
                        such as clandestine acquisition, illegal imports, and third-country
                        diversions. The Soviets will especially need equipment and technology for
                        their electronics, aerospace, and shipbuilding industries.</p>
                    <pb n="352" facs="0383" xml:id="pg_352"/>
                    <p>Soviet economic performance has deteriorated to the point that, if military
                        expenditures continue to expand as in the past, there will be few if any
                        resources left with which to raise living standards. Even slow growth of the
                        Soviet economy depends in substantial part on continued imports of Western
                        machinery, grain, and equipment for the energy sector:</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>• The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> needs large-scale imports
                            of Western food, especially grain, to increase food supplies even in
                            good crop years, and to keep them from falling in bad years.</p>
                        <p>• Western pipe and compressors are essential for the rapid expansion of
                            Soviet gas production, which will be the main source of additional
                            energy supplies and hard currency in the 1980s.</p>
                        <p>• Western equipment also is increasingly important in oil production, and
                            imports of Western production equipment, especially advanced machine
                            tools, would help to raise labor productivity at a time when the labor
                            force will be growing much more slowly than in the past.</p>
               </quote>
                    <p>Western restrictions on nonstrategic trade, if broadly supported and
                        sustained, would aggravate Soviet economic problems appreciably. Short of
                        comprehensive Western restrictions on trade, a Western embargo on oil and
                        gas equipment would have the greatest impact. A denial of new Western
                        credits would probably force a decline in overall Soviet hard currency
                        imports. In none of these cases would unilateral US actions have much
                        effect. Any decision to impose additional restrictions would have to
                        consider their impact on the West as well as on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Reduced economic capability would make allocations to Soviet military
                        programs more painful but probably would not lead to cuts in these programs
                        in the next several years. The Soviet military buildup has great momentum
                        and domestic political support. Faced with what it would consider economic
                        warfare, Moscow would be likely to turn to more autarkic economic policies,
                        tighter internal discipline, and a more truculent foreign policy. At the
                        same time, it is highly probable that these policies would result in
                        increased popular dissatisfaction, reduced worker productivity, further
                        reductions in long-term investment in order to meet short-term needs, and
                        greater inefficiency overall in the operation of the Soviet economy.</p>
                    <p>The West could slow improvement in the performance of Soviet weapons by the
                        late 1980s or the early 1990s by broadening controls over exports of
                        military-related technology—and increasing its efforts to plug leakages.
                        While there is little likelihood that even comprehensive and sustained
                        Western economic sanctions in the near term would significantly affect
                        Soviet military programs—many of which are already well under way—such
                        sanctions applied for a number of years could retard qualitative
                        improvements to Soviet weapon systems and <pb n="353" facs="0384" xml:id="pg_353"/>give rise to significant pressures internally to reduce
                        military spending at a time when the rest of the economy is in growing
                        difficulty. This would be even more likely should the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s economic problems be more prolonged
                        than the Soviet leaders expect and the remedies harder to find and slower to
                        take effect.</p>

                        <salute>Dear President <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>Your letter of October 15 makes it clear once again how profound are the
                        differences in our respective assessments of the causes of the major sources
                        of tension in the world. I find it difficult to accept your declaration that
                        Soviet actions in other parts of the world must have no bearing on our
                        relations. Soviet actions are having a direct and adverse impact on American
                        interests in many parts of the world. As I said in my letter to you of
                        September 22,<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">See the attachment to <ref target="#d85">Document 85</ref>.</note> Soviet resort to direct and
                        indirect use of force in regional conflicts is a matter of deep concern to
                        us as is the continued build up of military strength beyond the need for
                        self defense.</p>
                    <p>Despite these differences, however, we should strive to find a common ground
                        for agreement on matters of vital interest to our two countries and the rest
                        of the world. The cause of peace, and particularly the threat of nuclear
                        destruction hanging over mankind, require that our two countries make an
                        effort, together with our partners, to resolve our differences peacefully. I
                        assure you the United States is committed to such a process. I therefore
                        welcome an opportunity for businesslike cooperation in addressing world
                        problems. I believe that our exchanges, and the discussions in New York
                        between Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> and Foreign
                            <pb n="354" facs="0385" xml:id="pg_354"/>Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, have laid the essential groundwork
                        for such an effort. The key question now is how we can translate these
                        beginnings into concrete results. We are ready to advance specific solutions
                        and to hear out Soviet proposals aimed at relieving the dangers, as well as
                        the current human suffering, in problem areas around the world.</p>
                    <p>I am convinced, Mr. President, that we can achieve results in the coming year
                        if there is genuine good will and serious interest on both sides.</p>
                    <p>Afghanistan remains a major obstacle to progress, beclouding the
                        international atmosphere. It appears from recent communications that we both
                        agree on the need for progress toward an internationally acceptable solution
                        of this issue. We appear to agree on basic goals: a non-aligned, independent
                        Afghanistan, free of any foreign military presence and guaranteed against
                        any outside interference. This calls for a complete withdrawal of Soviet
                        forces from Afghanistan at the earliest possible date. The United States is
                        prepared to continue the exchange of views on questions that bear on a
                        political settlement in Afghanistan. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> will be in touch with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> to determine whether there is a
                        basis for a serious dialogue.</p>
                    <p>Now let me address your assertions regarding US policy towards Cuba. We do
                        not seek to interfere with Cuba’s independence nor are we interfering in
                        Cuba’s internal affairs. However, we do find entirely unacceptable Cuba’s
                        unremitting efforts to export its revolution by fomenting violent
                        insurgencies and terrorism against legitimate governments in Central
                        America.</p>
                    <p>But to get to the real purpose of my letter, arms control is a vital area
                        where progress can be made toward world peace. The United States is prepared
                        to accept equality in conventional, intermediate-range nuclear and strategic
                        forces at the lowest possible level of such forces. We are also prepared to
                        take other steps to enhance general peace and international security.</p>
                    <p>Let me begin with strategic forces. The United States will be prepared to
                        open negotiations on strategic arms reductions as soon as possible in the
                        new year. In approaching these talks we should learn from past experiences.
                        In my view however, the negotiations also will require fresh ideas—to which
                        both sides should devote urgent and serious attention—in order that we can
                        achieve genuine reductions in strategic forces. This will demand political
                        will and a readiness on both sides to accept a higher degree of openness in
                        order to enhance mutual confidence. In this connection, I welcome your
                        important public statement that verification measures going beyond national
                        technical means might be possible.</p>
                    <p>Concerning intermediate-range nuclear forces, the agreement to begin talks on
                        these systems on November 30 in Geneva marks an <pb n="355" facs="0386" xml:id="pg_355"/>important beginning in dealing with the difficult issue
                        of the military imbalance in these forces. We are ready to reach an
                        agreement with the Soviet Union which we believe is straightforward and
                        fair. We are prepared to cancel our plan to deploy Pershing II and
                        ground-launched cruise missiles on the condition that the Soviet Union in
                        turn dismantles all of its SS–20 missiles, retires and dismantles its SS–4,
                        and SS–5 missiles, and desists from further deployments of these or
                        comparable systems.<note n="3" xml:id="d103fn3">The November 12 National

               </p>
                    <p>Opportunities also exist for reductions in conventional forces in Europe.
                        Your offensive forces have become increasingly capable. The Soviet Union
                        could make no more convincing contribution to peace in Europe than by
                        substantially reducing its conventional forces. Now is the time to take
                        actions to achieve equality at a lower level of conventional forces in
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe offers another practical
                        possibility for increasing confidence and reducing the risks of war. At the
                        Madrid meeting, the Western countries have advanced proposals for a
                        Conference on Disarmament in Europe that could negotiate measures aimed at
                        reducing concerns about surprise attack. At the same time, I would hope we
                        could move the Helsinki process forward in a balanced way in all areas
                        taking favorable action to resolve certain humanitarian matters, such as the
                        reunification of divided families and the individual cases raised during the
                        recent discussions between our foreign ministers in New York. Such action I
                        have no doubt would have a favorable effect on deliberations in Madrid, and
                        on relations between our two countries. I feel I must tell you I am
                        personally concerned with the particular cases under discussion between
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> and your
                        representatives.</p>
                    <p>There is no shortage, Mr. President, of opportunities for easing world
                        tensions. If the Soviet Union is prepared to move forward in these areas of
                        genuine concern to the United States and its Allies, you will find me a
                        ready partner.</p>

                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> began the conversation by
                        recalling staying with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE_1">Thompson</persName> at our farm in Maryland. He went on to ask me
                        whether temporary ambassadors for special projects in the U.S. service were
                        paid less than the ambassadors designated to capitals; the question seemed
                        to bear on an issue in the Soviet service that he had to deal with. He asked
                        where I would live in Geneva, which led to a discussion of George Kennan,
                        whose apartment in Geneva we had once rented, and a further discussion of
                        George Kennan as an historian and a poet. He could not understand Kennan’s
                        interest in the Franco-Russian negotiations of 1895; they had no visible
                        bearing on today’s issues.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Kvitsinskiy</persName>
                  </hi>
                        When we sat down for lunch, he asked me whether I had ever met <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Kvitsinskiy</persName>. I said I had not but had heard
                        a great deal about him and understood him to be not only very knowledgeable
                        about political issues regarding Germany but also a skilled linguist and
                        competent negotiator. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said
                        he was relatively young, known as a “<persName corresp="#p_GR_2">German</persName>” in the Ministry, and that Semenov<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">Reference is to Soviet Ambassador to West Germany
                            Vladimir Semenov.</note> was reluctant to see him leave as his deputy in
                        Bonn. He asked me who would be my deputy; I replied <persName corresp="#p_GM_1">Glitman</persName> would be mine. I asked him whether
                        he knew who <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Kvitsinskiy</persName>’s deputy
                        would be. He said when he had last been in Moscow there was a discussion
                        whether the deputy should be a military or political man. He said he did not
                        know how the debate had turned out. He said he had gotten the impression
                        that they were looking toward a group on these negotiations who would be new
                        to the subject of arms control negotiations, whereas, at least for the time
                        being, they were thinking of a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        delegation composed of those who have had prior experience. I asked whether
                        that meant that <persName corresp="#p_KVP_1">Karpov</persName> was the
                        likely head of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> Delegation. He
                        answered in the affirmative.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">INF Decision-Making Process</hi> He then asked me who would
                        make decisions in the U.S. Government regarding the INF negotiations. I <pb n="357" facs="0388" xml:id="pg_357"/>said that administratively we
                        reported to <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>, but that questions of
                        policy were handled interdepartmentally with the final decision going up to
                        the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> and the President. I asked him how
                        the decision-making process was carried out in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. He said that most decisions were made by <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName> together, they reporting to the Politburo or
                        directly to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>. I
                        recollected that <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName>, as the
                        minister in charge of war production, and Smirnov, his deputy, had played a
                        role in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I separate from the military
                        and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that was correct. <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName> and Smirnov knew exactly what factories were able to
                        produce what and in what time, and therefore had an important contribution
                        to make in the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I and II discussions.
                        Now that <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName> was Minister of
                        Defense this type of expertise was no longer necessary, although Smirnov had
                        wider talents than merely war production and was sometimes consulted. I
                        asked <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> whether there was a
                        subcommittee of the Politburo which dealt with national security issues,
                        including arms control. He said there was not.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Duration of Negotiations</hi> He asked me how long I
                        expected the negotiations to continue before we arrived at an agreement. I
                        said I hoped for an agreement by next February. I thought the logic of our
                        case was clear. I understood Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Kvitsinskiy</persName> to be a competent and intelligent man and hoped
                        that he, seeing the logic of our case, could come to an agreement early.
                        This response seemed to surprise <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>.</p>

                        agree to what he was proposing. I said that I had carefully studied
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s interview in <hi rend="italic">Der Spiegel</hi>.<note n="4" xml:id="d104fn4">Reference is

                            visit to Bonn.</note> There were many things in the interview concerning
                        broad objectives with which I thought my government could agree. However,
                        when it came to the specific proposals outlined in the interview, there was
                        no possibility that the U.S. would agree with those proposals. I could ask
                        him the same question that he had asked me; how would they propose to get
                        from a position unacceptable to the U.S. to one that was mutually
                        acceptable?</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Free Discussion</hi> I went on to say that in order to get
                        to mutually agreed positions I thought it was important that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Kvitsinskiy</persName> and I have a wide-ranging
                        discussion and see if we could not agree as <pb n="358" facs="0389" xml:id="pg_358"/>to the facts with respect to the full range of weapon
                        systems which either side might consider to bear upon our negotiations. In
                        this connection, I said I took it that the principle which had applied in
                        preceding negotiations, that either side would be free to raise any points
                        it wished to, would hold in this negotiation. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> expressed complete agreement with that point.</p>
                    <p>I then went on to say that, whereas Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had mentioned a range of systems in his interview,
                        he had really focused upon the necessity for limitations on what he called
                        the medium-range ground based missiles; the Pershing IIs and <gloss target="#t_GLCM_1">GLCMs</gloss> on our side and the SS–20s and the 4s
                        and 5s, which he said would be phased out, on their side. I said the point I
                        was leading up to was I thought a distinction should be made between what
                        either side might wish to discuss and the systems on which we should focus
                        for specific limitation at this time.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Missile Definition</hi>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked me whether there was
                        any difference between what we were referring to as “intermediate-range”
                        missiles and what they called “medium-range” missiles. I said that I
                        considered the word “intermediate-range” to cover the entire range
                        intermediate between that of battlefield weapons and
                        intercontinental-strategic weapons.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Range vs Location</hi>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked me what we meant when
                        we used the word “global.” I replied that that was something which we would
                        be prepared to discuss in detail with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Kvitsinskiy</persName>; in general, it was my view that weapons should
                        be limited by range class rather than location. I asked <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had meant when he had used the
                        phrase “salvo” capability. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        said that was the inventory of all the available weapons. I said I had the
                        impression that the word implied simultaneity. He said that was true; it
                        meant all the weapons which could be launched at one time.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Project to Reduce the Risk of War</hi>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked me what I considered
                        the most important factor in an acceptable agreement; was it verification? I
                        said it was not. I thought the most important factor was the substantive
                        contribution that an agreement could make in carrying out the objectives
                        which both <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> and the President
                        had stated so clearly—that of reducing the risk of war. If one took that
                        objective seriously, then it should be possible to work out mutually
                        acceptable methods fully to do so. Having done that, we should then address
                        ourselves cooperatively to the important task of making the agreement
                        verifiable.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Allies’ Support</hi> At this point <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> changed the subject matter. He
                        asked me why we should not just forget about intermediate-range weapons and
                        just concentrate upon those systems which could attack the territory of the
                        other side. I said that in the long history <pb n="359" facs="0390" xml:id="pg_359"/>of U.S./USSR relations the differences between us had
                        had little to do with direct conflicts of interest between the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the U.S. as such. Most of them had
                        arisen over conflicts of interest with respect to geopolitical situations
                        between our two countries, particularly in Europe, the Middle East, Africa,
                        South and Southeast Asia, and the Far East. We did not in any way plan to
                        separate their interests from those of our Allies. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> rather lamely replied that, of
                        course, they would not separate their interests from those of the other
                        members of the Warsaw Pact. I noted that our negotiations were, of course,
                        bilateral and that neither side was therefore authorized to discuss the
                        limitation of weapon systems of other countries.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Speech Numbers</hi>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> then asked me about the
                        numbers in the President’s speech and inquired if I knew what was included
                        in the composition of the classes of systems behind those numbers. I said I
                        had not participated in their preparation and was not able to reply at this
                        time. I said I was sure that that information would be made fully available.
                        I went on to repeat the point that I thought it would be extremely useful if
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Kvitsinskiy</persName> and I could come to
                        agreement as to the data on weapon systems by class based on type and
                        range.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                  </hi> He asked me
                        about my views on the interface between these negotiations and the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> negotiations. I said there was a close
                        relationship, but that I thought it was possible to have a useful agreement
                        on INF without necessarily simultaneously having an agreement on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>He asked me why I had been against the ratification of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. I said I had not recommended to
                        senators that they vote against ratification. I had said I did not think
                        they should vote on the issue without fully understanding its terms and what
                        it did and did not do. I said I did have strong reservations about some of
                        the aspects of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. In particular, I
                        thought a mistake had been made in the Moscow Accord of 1974 of abandoning
                        the objective of having a treaty of indefinite duration and substituting
                        instead a target of an agreement expiring at the end of 1985. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he agreed with this; the
                        Protocol had already expired and the treaty itself had only a few more years
                        to run. He went on to say that for the time being it was possible for the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to live by the terms of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, even though not ratified, but it
                        might not be possible to continue this in the indefinate future.</p>
                    <p>I went on to say that I was concerned that the structure of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II set up incentives which were
                        perverse. He asked me what I meant by that. I said that the basic limitation
                        being on numbers of launchers of various classes, there was a strong
                        incentive for each side to build the largest missiles permitted by the
                        agreement. I thought this incentive to be perverse. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> protested that <pb n="360" facs="0391" xml:id="pg_360"/>they would be willing to see the limitation
                        on heavy missiles provide equal rights to both sides, but they understood
                        that we did not wish to deploy such missiles. They only wanted the right
                        because they already had them.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <gloss target="#t_RV_1">RV</gloss> Limit</hi> He then went
                        on to ask me whether I thought there was a better method of limitation. I
                        said I thought there was. One such method might be a limitation on the
                        number of reentry vehicles with a further limitation on the power of
                        individual reentry vehicles in order to prevent rabbits from being equated
                        with elephants. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that
                        they could see no problem with a limitation based on <gloss target="#t_RV_1">RVs</gloss>; we had more than did they.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">“Big” vs “Small” Agreement</hi>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> again changed the subject.
                        He asked me whether I wished a “big” as opposed to a “small” agreement. He
                        said to arrive at a big agreement might take a long time. Would not it
                        perhaps be advantageous to strive for a small agreement which would give the
                        world a sense of progress and might be done relatively quickly. I said I was
                        inherently a “big” agreement man; I took seriously the objective of reducing
                        the risk of war and felt that this could not be done by agreements which
                        were basically cosmetic. I repeated the point that if the Soviets took
                        seriously the general objectives contained in both <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s interview and in the President’s
                        speech, it should be possible to work out an agreement which would, in fact,
                        significantly reduce the risk of war. I said that to do so might be more
                        expensive, but that it would be worth the cost. We agreed that both sides
                        have gone to MIRVed weapons primarily because they are more cost-effective
                        per unit of destructiveness than single <gloss target="#t_RV_1">RV</gloss>
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Confidentiality</hi> I asked <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> what their policy would be on the confidentiality
                        of the negotiations. He said his side was much better disciplined to
                        maintain confidentiality than was ours. I agreed. I said I would talk to
                            <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Kvitsinskiy</persName> about the subject in
                        Geneva. I thought both delegations would wish to maintain a high degree of
                        confidentiality; undoubtedly governments would handle matters as they saw
                        fit.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Personals</hi>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> referred to his 19 years as
                        Ambassador in Washington and the contrast of that life with his upbringing
                        in Russia. He was part of a large family. His father had been a plumber and
                        his mother had died when he was young. He referred to his country retreat on
                        the Eastern Shore, some 15 miles from Gerard <persName corresp="#p_SWF_1">Smith</persName>’s place, with pleasure.</p>
                    <p>At this point I changed the subject. I said I thought I had been engaged in
                        the subject of U.S./USSR relations perhaps as long as anyone who was still
                        around. I said that in the summer of 1932 I had run into Bill Bullett on a
                        subway in New York and asked him <pb n="361" facs="0392" xml:id="pg_361"/>to
                        supper at my apartment, which I shared with Sidney Spivak. Spivak was
                        helping Franklin Roosevelt at the time during the election campaign of 1932.
                        Bullett had been a friend of John Maynard Keynes at the Versailles Treaty
                        conference and after the treaty had been put on a mission to Moscow to talk
                        to Chicherin about the possibility of improving Western relations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Spivak introduced Bullett to FDR
                        and Bullett was the one who persuaded Roosevelt to establish diplomatic
                        relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. I, therefore,
                        felt I had had something to do, even though indirectly, with the beginning
                        of official relations between the two countries.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that the INF
                        negotiations could be of great importance. For the time being, at least,
                        they were the only ones going on between the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the U.S. They could, in fact, be historic. He made a
                        final point that, if we could work out a successful agreement in this
                        negotiation, that would open the door to all manner of favorable
                        developments in the general field of U.S./Soviet relations.</p>

                            reported that “Romania faces a serious liquidity crisis, believes the

                        <hi rend="italic">Yugoslavia</hi> is also in serious enough trouble to cause
                        the British to request consultations about upcoming debt problems. Despite
                        that, Yugoslavia has re-lent to Czechoslovakia millions of dollars it
                        borrowed from an American bank. (S)</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">Soviet Union</hi> itself is drawing down its balances
                        in Western banks, selling gold even at today’s depressed prices and
                        deferring grain shipments because of lack of foreign exchange. The Russians
                        will have to finance grain purchases through commercial bank credit for the

                    <p>Soviet economic performance is well below target (except for natural gas) and
                        shortages have reached the point where sizable provincial cities have been

                        For example, measures taken to reduce Soviet earnings from oil and gas
                        exports will make their civilian vs. military choices more difficult and
                        increase the likelihood of internal unrest in the satellites. (C)</p>

                    <p>1. (Secret—Entire text).</p>
                    <p>2. At the Secretary’s request, Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> requested Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> to call on him November 27
                        concerning the <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName> hunger
                        strike. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> was indisposed so in
                        the interest of urgency <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>
                        received Minister-Counselor <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> in his stead. <gloss target="#t_EURSOV_1">EUR/SOV</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName>
                        accompanied the Under Secretary.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>, to be held very closely. Posts
                        should be aware that the Secretary raised the cases of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName> and his family and of Anatoliy <pb n="364" facs="0395" xml:id="pg_364"/>
                  <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shcharanskiy</persName> privately with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> November 11;<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2">See <ref target="#d101">Document 101</ref>.</note> that the President

                        US side to raise the question about <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName> and Scharansky (sic) unquote because quote such a
                        question . . . does not exist in Soviet-American relations. It belongs
                        entirely to the domestic competence of the Soviet state. Unquote. End <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> thanked <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> for calling on short notice,
                        and said he wished to talk on the Secretary’s behalf about the <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName> case and the hunger strike
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName> and his wife have
                        undertaken to secure release of their daughter-in-law. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> knew the Secretary and the
                        President were concerned about the case of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shcharanskiy</persName>, and the hunger strike redoubles this concern,
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> said. We had studied
                        the Soviet message received November 19 carefully, and hoped our points
                        would also be studied carefully on the Soviet side.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName>’s health is not good,
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> went on, and the hunger
                        strike threatens to make it worse. If he becomes gravely ill or dies, there
                        will be a tremendous public outcry. Public interest is intense. The
                        Secretary had asked him to talk about the case on this basis, in a low-key,
                        private way. Such a public outcry would not be in the interest of our
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p>6. Of course, <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> continued, our
                        interest in release of the daughter-in-law does not detract from our
                        interest in the cases of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shcharanskiy</persName> themselves.</p>
                    <p>7. In conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> drew
                        attention to the November 24 sense of the Senate resolution<note n="5" xml:id="d107fn5">S. Res #246, printed in <hi rend="italic">Congressional
                                Record—Senate</hi>, 1981, pp. 28997–29000.</note> on the hunger
                        strike which requested the Secretary of State to pass a copy of the
                        resolution to the Soviet Government. On the Secretary’s behalf he wished to
                        pass on this copy, as well as a non-paper embodying the points he had made.
                        (Text of non-paper ends this message.)</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> responded that this
                        was not a new subject, so he would not have much to say except that the
                        demarche would be reported. What had been said on instructions November 19
                        stands. With regard to the daughter-in-law, without entering into
                        technicalities it was true that no valid marriage had been executed. He
                        would report <pb n="365" facs="0396" xml:id="pg_365"/>that Congress had
                        asked the Secretary to hand over a copy of the resolution, but since the
                        matter was entirely a Soviet domestic one he could not accept it. However,
                        he repeated, the substance of the demarche would be reported. (<gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> accepted the text of the
                        non-paper. End <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>.) He did not know the
                        state of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName>’s health. In human
                        terms he wished him good health. Of course the hunger strike would hurt.
                        However, he suspected it would not end as tragically as many seemed to
                        think.</p>
                    <p>9. Speaking off-the-record, <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said the tremendous publicity surrounding the
                        hunger strike “cast a shadow” over it by arousing doubts as to its aims and
                        seriousness. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> pointed out that
                        good friends of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName> were coming
                        to US with pleas for intervention, but of an entirely private,
                        non-publicized kind. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>
                        concluded that may be true, but others—including the relatives who had
                        visited the Soviet Embassy two days ago—always seemed to come with
                        newsmen.</p>
                    <p>10. Text of U.S. non-paper, begin text. The Secretary has asked me to express
                        to you once again the President’s personal interest and his own in seeing
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName> and his family and
                        Anatoliy Shcharanskiy released.</p>
                    <p>The message received November 19 has been carefully studied. There appear to
                        US to be a number of factors we hope the Soviet side will weigh with equal
                        care.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName>’s health is poor. The hunger
                        strike will place his life in danger.</p>
                    <p>There would be a major public outcry if <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName> were to become extremely ill or die. Public concern
                        in the United States is intense. The latest evidence is the resolution
                        passed unanimously by the Senate November 24. On the Secretary’s behalf, I
                        would like to present you with a copy.</p>
                    <p>We cannot believe such a major public outcry with regard to this case is in
                        the interest of your government, any more than it is in our mutual interest
                        to ignore any of the cases mentioned by the Secretary November 11 and by the
                        President in his November 17 letter to President <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>. End text.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Mr. President,</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I note with satisfaction that in your letter of November 17, 1981<note n="2" xml:id="d108fn2">See <ref target="#d103">Document 103</ref>.</note> you
                        have expressed yourself ready to strive in the spirit of businesslike
                        cooperation, despite the existing differences between our countries, to find
                        a common ground for agreement on matters of vital interest to our two
                        countries and the rest of the world.</p>
                    <p>On our part we believed and continue to believe that it is precisely such an
                        approach that is required of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and
                        the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> if we are to be guided by the task
                        of eliminating the threat of nuclear war. We cannot and have no right to
                        proceed in a different manner and to avoid responsibility which rests on our
                        States.</p>
                    <p>The main thing, however, is to substantiate the correct general premise with
                        specific actions by both sides. Mere statements, no matter how good they may
                        sound, are not enough to achieve progress in the resolution of no simple
                        problems before us. What is required is realistic positions and practical
                        proposa ls which would take into account the legitimate interests of the
                        other side rather than be built around the desire to somehow infringe on
                        those interests. Otherwise the declared positive goals will remain at best
                        good intentions if not just an attempt to score a propaganda point. Neither
                        of the two will be helpful.</p>
                    <p>From this standpoint, I shall tell you frankly, the considerations advanced
                        in your letter on specific issues are, to put it mildly, very far from the
                        objective reality. Suffice it to mention the assertion to the effect that
                        the Soviet Union is allegedly increasing its military power beyond its
                        defense requirements. A conclusion is drawn then from this clearly distorted
                        premise that the Soviet Union has to disarm unilaterally, while the US can
                        continue to build on and on its military might at its own discretion. And
                        this is what in fact is taking place in the United States.</p>
                    <pb n="367" facs="0398" xml:id="pg_367"/>
                    <p>Here we are faced with what is called “the double book-keeping” whereby in
                        counting the Soviet arms in question their numbers are made to look many
                        times higher, and—conversely—when it comes to the US, such numbers are
                        drastically understated. Moreover, hundreds of nuclear systems in the
                        possession of Britain and France are totally excluded from the counting,
                        whereas on the Soviet side even those systems are counted which do not
                        belong to the category of medium-range weapons and, indeed, have nothing to
                        do whatsoever with Europe and still less so with the US.</p>
                    <p>Why is it necessary, Mr. President, to try to compare things which in their
                        essence cannot be compared? It is difficult to dismiss a thought that the
                        calculation here is based on the fact that most people are poorly versed in
                        such matters and therefore will hardly be able to grasp the subject. The
                        past experience shows, however, that sooner or later people will be able to
                        sort things out for themselves. After all, both you and ourselves know very
                        well that even if either side wished to somehow take advantage of the other
                        in such matters, to do so would be impossible. The guarantee in this respect
                        is provided by the national technical means of verification of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the USA. Recognition of the
                        effectiveness of such a principle lies at the basis of the SALT–I and SALT–2
                        agreements. Respect for this principle consistently guides the Soviet Union
                        in its practical activities.</p>
                    <p>As a “straightforward and fair” solution of the problem of medium-range
                        nuclear arms you suggest that all Soviet medium-range missiles—both the new
                        “SS–20’s” and the old “SS–4’s” and “SS–5’s” be eliminated. I wouldn’t argue
                        with respect to the “straightforward” nature of this proposal, but to call
                        it “fair” and generally a serious one was, of course, impossible not for us
                        alone but for all those who retained the sense of reality.</p>
                    <p>As recently as yesterday the US officials acknowledged, and some of them do
                        so today, that there continues to exist an approximate parity in nuclear
                        arms in Europe. But even those among US officials, who are trying despite
                        the facts to question it, keep only saying that the parity has been
                        allegedly upset by the introduction of the “SS–20” missiles. It follows from
                        this that when a considerably larger number of the “SS–4” and “SS–5”
                        missiles was in place compared to their present number, no question of
                        “disbalance” occurred to anybody. Why then, may we ask, are we offered to
                        scrap all our medium-range missiles while the entire <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s nuclear arsenal remains intact? Is
                        there any logic here, Mr. President?</p>
                    <p>Let me say it straight away that this is not the kind of basis on which
                        questions related to the national security of states can be resolved. In
                        matters of this nature it is necessary to be strictly guided by reciprocity,
                        the principle of equality and equal security. Our delegation in Geneva <pb n="368" facs="0399" xml:id="pg_368"/>has the instructions to proceed
                        exactly on this premise. If the US side also adheres to that principle, then
                        one can expect success in the negotiations. There is no other way to achieve
                        success.</p>
                    <p>Should the West demonstrate its readiness to reach agreement on a truly
                        complete renunciation by both sides of all types of the existing
                        medium-range nuclear arms deployed in Europe or around it, we on our part
                        will be forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>We could also agree to free Europe altogether from nuclear arms—both
                        medium-range and tactical. That would be a genuine “zero-option” fair for
                        all sides.</p>
                    <p>Indeed it really appears to us strange to call on the Soviet Union to make a
                        contribution, as you write, to peace in Europe by reducing its conventional
                        forces there. This call should not be addressed to us. You must be aware of
                        the fact that in recent years we unilaterally withdrew from Central Europe
                        20,000 troops and 1,000 tanks, while the US, on the contrary, added tens of
                        thousands of men to its troops in Europe. That’s the actual state of affairs
                        in real life.</p>
                    <p>The question is which side is lacking in constructiveness and practical
                        steps?</p>
                    <p>When you, Mr. President, indicate that the US is prepared to open
                        negotiations on strategic arms reductions as soon as possible in the new
                        year, we would like to understand this to mean that such negotiations will
                        actually resume in the near future. We are for it.</p>
                    <p>It follows from your letter that the US side stands not just for limitation,
                        but for the reduction of strategic arms. In this connection, I would like to
                        remind you that the SALT–2 treaty provides for such reductions, and very
                        substantial reductions at that. We have been and continue to be committed to
                        this approach. It is important, however, that in this respect, too, all the
                        factors determining the strategic situation should be taken into account,
                        and that the principle of equality and equal security should be strictly
                        observed.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the Madrid meeting of states-participants of the Conference on
                        Security and Cooperation in Europe and, above all, the question of convening
                        a European conference on confidence-building measures and disarmament: if
                        the Western countries on their part—and it is now their turn to act—show
                        readiness to travel their length of the distance in response to our
                        far-reaching constructive steps, then one can expect to conclude this
                        meeting with tangible positive results and to ensure a stable development of
                        the process initiated by the Helsinki Final Act.</p>
                    <p>I am not going to engage now in polemics on the question of Afghanistan,
                        although I cannot in any way agree with what has been said by you on this
                        matter. As to your indication that you are prepared <pb n="369" facs="0400" xml:id="pg_369"/>to continue the exchange of views on a political
                        settlement around Afghanistan, on our part we did not have and do not have
                        now any objections to that. Our position on concrete aspects of the
                        political settlement is known to you. However, we have not yet received your
                        views on the substance of the problem which you intended to convey through
                        your Ambassador in Moscow.</p>
                    <p>A few words about Cuba. It has to be stated that the United States continues
                        to deliberately aggravate the situation around that country and to increase
                        tensions in the entire Carribean area. This is a dangerous, slippery road.
                        At the same time, we are convinced that any step by the US towards
                        normalization of relations with Cuba would find an appropriate response on
                        the part of that country.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, I would like to reemphasize that although differences between
                        our countries will, of course, remain also in the future, our position is
                        not to exacerbate those differences or multiply them and, even more so, not
                        to attempt to overpower each other—which is an unpromising
                        perspective—instead, we favor efforts to expand areas of accord.</p>
                    <p>I think that at least there gradually emerges a set of really important
                        questions on whose solution our two countries should primarily concentrate
                        their joint efforts being conscious of our mutual responsibility. We are
                        prepared for such work.</p>

                    <p>On October 31, the Soviet Ambassador responded to proposals on Afghanistan
                        made by <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Al Haig</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> during their conversation in New
                        York in September<note n="2" xml:id="d109fn2">See <ref target="#d90">Document 90</ref>.</note> and to <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> on October 16.<note n="3" xml:id="d109fn3">See <ref target="#d95">Document 95</ref>.</note> Interpreting these proposals
                        to mean that “there exists a common point of departure,” the Soviet
                        government proposes that conversations be opened between US and Soviet
                        experts on the subject. (S)</p>
                    <p>Apparently what the Soviet government has in mind is the following remark of
                        Al’s during his private talk with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> on September 28, as recorded in the memorandum of
                        conversation:</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>(Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>) thought that
                            it would be very helpful if the following ingredients were included:
                            First, the Afghanistan government should take steps now to broaden its
                            base. Second, the Soviet government could simultaneously study a formula
                            for a phased withdrawal. Third, outside powers could take a number of
                            steps . . . regarding cross border activities from outside the borders
                            of Afghanistan. He thought that implementation of all three steps in
                            tandem could offer a solution. (p. 13). (S)</p>
               </quote>
                    <p>The Soviet government almost certainly interpreted this statement as an about
                        face by the United States on Afghanistan. Instead of insisting on a Soviet
                        withdrawal as a precondition for any international cooperation in the
                        region, this proposal suggests that the Soviets “<hi rend="italic">study</hi> a formula for a phased withdrawal” and “broaden the base” of
                        their puppet regime in Kabul, while we and other powers concurrently would
                        help stop the flow of weapons and soldiers to the Afghan Freedom Fighters.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>The proposal must have seemed sufficiently tempting for Moscow to propose the
                        meeting of experts. It is doubtful if their response indicates a more
                        conciliatory attitude on Afghanistan. (S)</p>

                        contains a number of interesting points, including a Soviet expression of
                        interest in U.S.-Soviet bilateral talks involving “specialists.” <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s demarche
                            may well be a tactical ploy, but we cannot exclude the possibility that
                            it is a signal of tentative willingness to negotiate seriously</hi>.
                        After consulting with the Pakistanis and briefing the British, French, and
                        Germans, we will instruct Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> to meet with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> to probe Soviet intentions.</p>

                            Demarche:</hi> The most striking and potentially significant aspects of
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s demarche are: (1) <hi rend="italic">the highly unusual absence of any direct reference to the
                            unacceptable Afghan/Soviet proposals for a settlement or to the general
                            Soviet line that the root cause of the Afghanistan problem is “external
                            interference” from Pakistan supported by the U.S.</hi>; and (2) the
                        reference to Soviet willingness to include “specialists” in U.S.-Soviet
                        exchanges of views on a “political settlement around Afghanistan.”</p>
                    <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Potential Pitfalls: There is a strong possibility that the
                            Soviet approach is a tactical ploy</hi> designed to engage us in
                        bilateral negotiations which might be used by Moscow to reduce international
                        criticism of the Soviet occupation, create tensions in the U.S.-Pakistani
                        relationship, and complicate our efforts to obtain regional cooperation with
                        our Southwest Asia security strategy. The Soviets might also hope that such
                        talks would advance their current “peace offensive” or that the very fact of
                        the talks would induce us to alter other aspects of our policy and actions
                        on Afghanistan. In the context of U.S.-Soviet relations, Moscow might try to
                        portray its agreement to bilateral talks as a “concession” to us for which
                        we should compensate the Soviet Union in arms control or some other aspect
                        of the U.S.-Soviet relationship. <hi rend="italic">Thus, we believe that the
                            Soviet approach should be handled with considerable care</hi>.</p>

                     <hi rend="italic">Possibilities: On the other hand, we cannot exclude the
                            possibility that <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s
                            approach is an expression of tentative Soviet flexibility on the
                            Afghanistan issue</hi>. In this connection, we find particularly
                        interesting <pb n="372" facs="0403" xml:id="pg_372"/>the non-polemical tone
                        of the demarche and the omission of any direct reference to the unacceptable
                        Afghan/Soviet proposals for a settlement. If the Soviet approach does
                        reflect new flexibility on the substance of the Afghanistan problem, it
                        could also have important positive implications for our overall approach to
                        U.S.-Soviet relations.</p>
                    <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Next Steps:</hi> We need now to determine whether <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s demarche actually signalled an

                            seek their views. We will provide more general briefings to the British,
                            French, and Germans. Subsequently, we intend to instruct Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> to seek an

                    <p>In connection with the readiness expressed by the US side to continue on the
                        level of experts the exchange of views on questions concerning a political
                        settlement around Afghanistan, which the Secretary of State spoke for at the
                        meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">A.A. Gromyko</persName> in New York
                        as well as in his conversation with the Soviet Ambassador on October 16, we,
                        on our part, confirm our positive attitude towards such a possibility.</p>
                    <p>It appears to us that the previous discussions revealed, besides the
                        differences in the positions of our two countries, also certain coinciding
                        elements. We understand what has been said on the American side to mean that
                        the US would like to see Afghanistan remain an independent and non-aligned
                        state maintaining good relations with its neighbors and that there is an
                        interest in Washington in having a stable and secure situation in that
                        region.</p>
                    <p>If it is the case—and this has been precisely the approach always followed by
                        us—then, apparently, it can be assumed that there exists a common point of
                        departure for a more specific discussion of the pertinent questions
                        concerning the political settlement around Afghanistan.</p>
                    <pb n="373" facs="0404" xml:id="pg_373"/>
                    <p>We would be prepared to hold an exchange of views on those questions through
                        our embassies in Washington or Moscow with the participation, if need be, of
                        additional specialists who deal with the said questions.</p>
                    <p>We are for conducting such discussions in a business-like manner, in the
                        spirit of realism, and without unnecessary polemics. The work that would be
                        done by our representatives could be of use for the subsequent exchange of
                        views to be held during the meeting between the ministers of the two
                        countries scheduled early next year.</p>

                    <p>On December 3, 1981, President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Ronald
                            Reagan</persName> chaired a meeting of the National Security Council in
                        the Cabinet Room of the White House from 2:42 to 3:26 p.m to discuss
                        Monitoring Overseas Direct Employment (MODE) and Civil Defense. (Reagan
                        Library, President’s Daily Diary) The principals considered civil defense in
                        the context of the strategic modernization project that <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> outlined on October 2 in the East
                        Room of the White House. (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                  </hi>, 1981, pages 878–880) The
                        conversation centered on three proposed options: (1) “Augment the present
                        program ($130M per year) with two years’ research planning and development
                        in blast shelter construction, placement and distribution”; (2) “Enhance
                        population protection capability by 1987 and make a decision on industrial
                        protection by 1984”; (3) “Enhanced protection of population and essential
                        industry by 1987.” (Paper prepared in the National Security Council,
                        undated; Reagan Library, Executive Secretariat, <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>: <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Meeting File:
                        Records, 1981–88, <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 00027)</p>
                    <p>Midway through the meeting, President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> “pointed out that both Options 2 and 3 require
                        investment of some $237 million FY 83. He added that there was no question
                        in his mind that the Soviet Union has a tremendous advantage in civil
                        defense just as it has an advantage in weapons.” Deputy Secretary of Defense
                            <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Frank Carlucci</persName> responded “that
                        the Soviet Union is already at Option 3.” The President went on to say that
                        “it was obvious that no one wanted Option 1,” that “Option 2 does not yet
                        commit us to the most expensive program,” and that “it was a shame we did
                        not have extensive caves near our population centers.” The President also
                        “pointed out that the Soviets already have underground factories.”
                        (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>In response to Counselor to the President <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Edwin
                            Meese</persName>’s suggestion of a Presidential decision, President
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> “said he would like to
                            <pb n="374" facs="0405" xml:id="pg_374"/>stew about the issue. He then
                        asked if evacuation of cities is practical.” Deputy National Security
                        Advisor <persName corresp="#p_NJW_1">James Nance</persName> “responded by
                        saying that <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> estimates that if the
                        Soviets evacuate their cities prior to a nuclear attack, their losses would
                        be 15 million, a number less than they lost in the Second World War or in
                        the purges. The U.S., on the other hand, would lose some 150 million people.
                        An effective civil defense program can cut that down to less than 40
                        million.” President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> “asked
                        how we could care for all the evacuees that leave high-risk areas.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Meese</persName> “said that it would be just
                        like a weekend in New York State.” Major General Bennett Lewis of the
                        Federal Emergency Management Administration “said that it can be done,” and
                        went on to relate “the explanations given to him by Dr. Edward Teller and
                        outlined some systems that could be put in place early to help with the
                        evacuation itself and to beef-up the host areas,” as well as to say “that
                        the evacuees would not have to stay in host areas very long; nature would
                        take care of most of the radiation and decontamination operations would also
                        be conducted.” (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Meese</persName> “then said that the most
                        important element in the program now is the psychological advantage it would
                        offer.” President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> stated his
                        approval for Option 2, after which Vice President <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George Bush</persName> “related a story about Soviet
                        Ambassador [Yakov] Malik who was in Japan in the Hiroshima bombings.”
                        President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> “responded with a
                        joke about the country boy who wanted to be far enough away from a nuclear
                        blast that he could say, ‛What was that?’” At that point the meeting
                        adjourned. (Ibid.) That evening, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> wrote in his diary: “N.S.C meeting—I approved
                        starting a Civil Defense buildup. Right now in a nuclear war we’d lose 150
                        mil. people. The Soviets could hold their loss down to less than were killed
                        in W.W. II.” (Brinkley, ed., <hi rend="italic">The <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Diaries</hi>, Volume I, page

                            violates their intent. Basket II, Section I, Sub-paragraph B of the
                            Helsinki Final Act states: ‛Participating states will deal in a positive

                            reunited with members of their family.’ The Soviet Government could
                            argue that Miss Alekseeva, having married Mr. Semionov by proxy in the
                            United States, is by Soviet law not really a member of his family: but
                            the only reason that a marriage-by-proxy had to be organized last summer
                            is that Miss Alekseeva had been unable for over three years to secure an
                            exit visa which would have enabled her to go through a regular marriage
                            ceremony.” (Ibid.)</note>

                        causes and his great friendship for the United States, it would be most

                        statement on <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName>’s behalf. A
                        suggested text is included at Tab A.<note n="3" xml:id="d112fn3">Attached
                            but not printed is the text: “Academician <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Andrei Sakharov</persName>, a leading Soviet scientist and Nobel
                            Peace Prize Laureate, and his wife have been for over a week on a hunger
                            strike. They are protesting the repeated refusal of the Soviet
                            authorities to grant an exit visa to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName>’s daughter-in-law, Elizaveta Alekseeva, to join
                            her husband, Mr. Aleksi Semionov, a student at an American university.
                            The young couple has been separated for a long time. I am concerned for
                            the health of Mr. and Mrs. Sakharov and strongly urge the Soviet
                            government to allow Mrs. Alekseeva to join her husband.” The White House
                            released the statement the same day. (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers:

               </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> began by noting the
                        importance of Soviet eagerness to continue the dialogue begun in September
                        with Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>.
                        The next meeting would be in Geneva on January 26 <pb n="380" facs="0411" xml:id="pg_380"/>and 27. The Secretary recalled that at the September
                        meeting he had tabled U.S. concerns about a number of Soviet activities.
                        These activities had continued unabated. The Soviet Union had supplied
                        60,000 tons of military equipment to Cuba in the first nine months of this
                        year. That was three times the flow of recent years. The Soviets had stated
                        that their objective was to modernize the Cuban forces, but the U.S. was
                        skeptical.</p>
                    <p>In September Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had
                        spoken frankly to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> on finding
                        a solution in southern Africa within the framework of the Contact Group.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had not rejected
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s approach, but neither had
                        there been Soviet movement in the meantime. The subject of southern Africa
                        would be high on the U.S. agenda for Geneva. There had been increasing
                        evidence of Angolan, front-line state, and even Cuban interest in a Cuban
                        withdrawal from Angola.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that since the first meeting there had been clear
                        indications that the Soviets were looking for a way out of Afghanistan. It
                        was important for the West to remain unified on that subject. The Secretary
                        thought that the Soviets might well make specific proposals on: withdrawal
                        of forces, Western assurances on cross-border “interferences,” return of
                        refugees, and some sort of tricky formula on self-determination contingent
                        on the implementation of the first three elements. The Secretary promised to
                        be back to the others by telegram in order to coordinate positions.</p>
                    <p>On the subject of Strategic Arms Reductions Talks (<gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>), the Secretary mentioned that he hoped soon to have U.S.
                        positions on venue and starting date.</p>
                    <p>The second meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, the
                        Secretary continued, would also touch on bilateral issues such as a
                        long-term grain agreement, a maritime agreement, and the status of the U.S.
                        Consulate in Kiev.</p>
                    <p>As for the possibility of a U.S.-Soviet summit, the Secretary said it was too
                        early to suggest that the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        discussions could open the door to a summit. President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> was well disposed toward the idea
                        of a summit, but only if something meaningful could result.</p>
                    <p>Summarizing the state of U.S.-Soviet relations, the Secretary said that the
                        tone of exchanges was better. Both sides seemed to have a constructive
                        attitude, which promoted dialogue. However, the U.S. had not found any
                        flexibility in Soviet positions on the more difficult issues. Of course, the
                        U.S. welcomed any advice or counsel from the Allies.</p>
                    <p>Lord
                        <persName corresp="#p_CLP_1">Carrington</persName> asked whether it was the
                        U.S. intention to continue the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        contacts. Those contacts seemed to the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> an
                        admirable channel. The Secretary responded that continuation was probably
                        inevitable because so many topics had been opened.</p>
                    <pb n="381" facs="0412" xml:id="pg_381"/>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_CLP_1">Carrington</persName> went on to say that the
                        question of a U.S.-Soviet summit was of a different scale. A summit required
                        a great deal of preparation. One of the most important purposes the U.S.
                        could achieve in contacts with the Soviets was to lay down the limits of
                        Western tolerance for Soviet activities. Had those limits been clearer in
                        1979, the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan might not have occurred.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary agreed wholeheartedly. Despite the criticism which was often
                        directed at the U.S. for anti-Soviet rhetoric, the fact remained that the
                        Soviet Union had not undertaken any new aggressive initiative since the
                        beginning of the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                        Administration. That was partly because the Soviets had overextended
                        themselves, but also was due in part to Soviet perception of new U.S.
                        firmness.</p>
                    <p>French Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Cheysson</persName>
                        thought that the pattern of Soviet behavior was also determined to a large
                        extent by the “remarkable sclerosis” of the whole Soviet system. It was
                        important for the Allies to focus on specific subjects like Afghanistan, but
                        there seemed to be little likelihood of positive Soviet responses.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary observed that while the public focus of U.S.-Soviet relations
                        seemed to be on arms control, he personally did not view arms control as a
                        centerpiece. Soviet aggression in regional disputes was the real threat to
                        peace. The U.S. had to take steps to resolve these threats, but knew that it
                        would be futile to give high priority to situations that could involve
                        serious loss of face by the Soviets. For that reason, the U.S. had to
                        emphasize ambiguous situations, such as southern Africa and support for
                        revolutionary movements in other parts of the Third World.</p>
                    <p>German Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GHD_1">Genscher</persName>
                        turned to the subject of the recent visit by Soviet President <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Leonid Brezhnev</persName> to Bonn. One of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s principal aims, <persName corresp="#p_GHD_1">Genscher</persName> asserted, had undoubtedly been to
                        test German solidarity on both tracks of the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> double decision. The Soviets were also interested in
                        whether the West would be negotiating seriously on INF. With this in mind,
                            <persName corresp="#p_GHD_1">Genscher</persName> would stress at the
                        forthcoming <gloss target="#t_NAC_1">NAC</gloss> Ministerial that the most
                        important thing any <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Ally could do to
                        contribute to the Western negotiating position on INF would be to declare
                        willingness to deploy INF weapons. Overemphasis on negotiations was not
                        wise.</p>
                    <p>Commenting on the atmosphere of the <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> visit and on <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s health, <persName corresp="#p_GHD_1">Genscher</persName> said that the Soviet President had read all of his
                        papers and never made an <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> statement. It was
                        clear that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had little
                        endurance, but he was still clearly number one in the hierarchy. It was also
                        clear, however, that those who control the flow of information to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had enormous power.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_CLP_1">Carrington</persName> suggested that another of
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s objectives in Bonn had
                        been to end the isolation imposed by the West in the wake of the <pb n="382" facs="0413" xml:id="pg_382"/>invasion of Afghanistan. <persName corresp="#p_GHD_1">Genscher</persName> agreed, but said that the first
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> meeting had been a preliminary step out of that
                        isolation. The visit had not been an easy one for the Soviets to undertake;
                        they had to cope with demonstrations organized by the CDU and FDP against
                        the Soviet position in Afghanistan. President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s November 18 speech had been right on target, and
                        took away 50 percent of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                        negotiating offers.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> expressed pleasure at
                            <persName corresp="#p_GHD_1">Genscher</persName>’s intentions for the
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC_1">NAC</gloss> Ministerial, especially because the
                        Dutch Foreign Minister seemed to be looking for ways to further weaken
                        communique passages on INF deployments. It was important to prevent
                        that.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_CLP_1">Carrington</persName> agreed that weakening of
                        the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> position on deployment would
                        seriously harm the U.S. negotiating position in Geneva.</p>
                    <p>On Afghanistan, the Ministers agreed that Western unity was essential, and
                        that a return to normal relations with the Soviet Union was not possible as
                        long as Soviet troops were there.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the general nature of Soviet involvement in regional problems,
                            <persName corresp="#p_CLP_1">Carrington</persName> asked for the
                        Secretary’s views on coordination between Cuban and Soviet policy.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary responded that he had always believed that Soviet advisers, not
                        Cubans, were running the Nicaraguan armed forces. In Angola, Soviets, not
                        Cubans, were running <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>. That had been
                        confirmed by the government of South Africa and by <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> leader <persName corresp="#p_SJM_1">Savimbi</persName>. There were thousands of Soviets in Libya, and they
                        make the key decisions there also.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_CLP_1">Carrington</persName> asked how that affected
                        Central America. The Secretary said that because the Soviets made the key
                        decisions in regional situations, they could resolve those situations if
                        they were interested in improving relations with the West. The results of a
                        strong U.S. demarche to the Soviets on their activities in Cuba after the
                        assassination of President <persName corresp="#p_KRT_1">Kennedy</persName>
                        had demonstrated that the Soviets could regulate Cuban behavior precisely.
                        To be sure, insurgencies would continue, but without Soviet exacerbation
                        they would not become threats to world stability. This meant, continued the
                        Secretary, that the West had to continue to press the Soviet Union and the
                        Cubans and also to work at the roots of the economic and social problems
                        which created the basis for successful insurgencies.</p>

                        thing, but there are “others” who think differently. In the meantime a
                        tremendous public uproar develops, with damaging consequences. It would have
                        been better to choose one course and stick with it. This way, not only has
                        damage been sustained but the “principled, consistent” policy approach which
                        should govern has been sacrificed.</p>
                    <p>4. Comment. We do not overinterpret these remarks, since they are
                        characteristically ambiguous and ingratiating after the fact. At the same
                        time, they bring to mind <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>’s concluding remark during Under Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>’s November 27

                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName>, where on a “personal”
                        basis he expressed confidence that the case would not end as “many” were
                        then projecting. They also tend to confirm our assumption of serious and
                        shifting policy debate on <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName>.
                        Finally, they support the thesis that the decision to release Liza Alexeyeva

                    <p>On the evening of December 12, 1981, First Secretary of the Polish United
                        Workers Party <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Wojciech Jaruzelski</persName>
                        declared martial law in Poland. Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Alexander Haig</persName> was in Belgium for a
                        meeting of the North Atlantic Council. “The news was flashed to me at three
                        o’clock Sunday morning Brussels,” he wrote in his memoir. “The timing of
                        this action, which obviously had been meticulously prepared—and which we
                        knew had been planned in minute detail in the U.S.S.R.—came without
                        forewarning to the United States.” Using a secure telephone in his hotel
                        room, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> spoke to Vice President
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George H.W. Bush</persName> in Washington
                        and Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Caspar
                            Weinberger</persName> on a plane over the Atlantic Ocean. (<persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Caveat</hi>, pages
                        246–250) <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> also spoke to
                        President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Ronald Reagan</persName>, who was at
                        Camp David, from 9:12 to 9:16 a.m. EST. At 1:33 p.m., <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> flew from Camp David to Washington
                        and met with <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName>, Deputy Secretary

                        and Acting President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_NJW_1">Nance</persName>, from 3:03 to 3:22 p.m. (Reagan
                        Library, President’s Daily Diary) Minutes for the telephone call and the
                        meeting were not found. <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> wrote
                        in his diary that day: “A long walk in the morning then an afternoon at the
                        desk. Somehow it seems easier there. Word received that Poland has moved on
                        Solidarity. Leaders have been arrested, union meetings &amp; publications
                        banned, martial law declared. Our intelligence is that it was engineered
                        &amp; ordered by the Soviet. If so, and I believe it is, the situation is
                        really grave. One thing certain—they won’t get that $100 mil. worth of
                        corn.” (Brinkley, ed., <hi rend="italic">The <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Diaries</hi>, Volume I, page 92) Further

                        <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>, in temporary absence of

                        provide text of Secretary’s 4:00 p.m. Brussels statement on the Polish

                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s statement was transmitted in telegram 329838 to
                            all Diplomatic and Consular Posts, December 13. (Department of State,
                            Central Foreign Policy File, D810593–0279)</note> The Under Secretary,
                        in walking <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> through the
                        statement, emphasized that the U.S. was deeply concerned about developments
                        in Poland and their effect on the stability of the region. He said the U.S.
                        urged all parties to exercise the maximum degree of restraint, prudence, and
                        caution in their approach to the Polish situation. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, in briefing congressional leaders and
                        other public figures, had urged them to be cautious in their public
                        statement; the U.S. did not want to see an over-reaction or excess
                        excitement, but at the same time wanted to convey to the Soviet Government
                        how deeply concerned we were. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> drew particular attention to the last paragraph of
                        the Secretary’s statement to effect that Poles should find solution to their
                        problems without any outside interference.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>, in response, said he
                        wanted to clarify just what was being discussed. The Secretary’s statement
                        expressed concern about the situation “in” Poland, and noted that this had
                        been taken up with the Polish authorities. This was not, he stated, a
                        subject for the US-Soviet bilateral relationship. The Polish events were a
                        domestic matter, not the subject for any diplomatic activities between us.
                        The Under Secretary replied that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        was closely allied with Poland. It had to be assumed that there had been
                        close consultations between the Polish and Soviet Governments prior to
                        recent events. For this reason the U.S. wanted to communicate its general
                        concern.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said he understood the
                        U.S. concern, and welcomed the U.S. appeal for cautiousness. He urged the
                        U.S. not to get excited, but to exercise coolness and calmness until it had
                        a clearer picture of the situation, so that there would be no mis-steps. The
                        Under <pb n="386" facs="0417" xml:id="pg_386"/>Secretary replied that this
                        was also the U.S. approach. The Secretary had urged that the situation not
                        be overcharged with emotion.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said that nothing in
                        the present picture would warrant any U.S. concern about the Soviet Union.
                        The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was not part of the situation.
                        Moscow was watching developments but it was for the Poles to decide. The
                        Under Secretary said that the U.S. was also watching the situation. We had
                        seen the initial reaction from Solidarity headquarters, including the call
                        for a general strike. We hoped violence could be avoided, and a peaceful
                        solution found.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said this was up to
                        the Polish authorities. If they decided that it was necessary to use force,
                        that was their own business. Outside parties could not dictate to a major
                        sovereign power what to do and what not to do. Any legal government,
                        including the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, had the means to impose
                        its will on certain elements if they acted against the laws of the country.
                        He added that he did not like the part of the Secretary’s statement calling
                        for compromise and negotiation. This could be interpreted as interference in
                        Poland’s internal affairs.</p>
                    <p>7. The Under Secretary noted that thus far the Polish authorities had been
                        seeking a compromise solution. There were great risks in a turn to violence.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> replied that no one
                        was in favor of violence. But others could not tell the Poles what to do.
                        This was their own business. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> recalled the period of “critical weekends” last
                        spring, when the U.S. had overreacted, and said he hoped the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would view the present situation more
                        calmly and coolly. It would be an overreaction for a big power to become an
                        element of the situation, one way or the other. The Under Secretary
                        reiterated that all concerned should exercise moderation and restraint.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> used the occasion to
                        hand over non-paper on Soviet position on Law of the Sea consultations,
                        which <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> was to have delivered
                        December 14 (to be cabled <gloss target="#t_septel_1">septel</gloss>).
                        Before concluding the meeting, the sides agreed that, in commenting on the
                        meeting before the press, both sides would take the line that several
                        subjects were discussed, Poland among them, and decline further comment.</p>

                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>.</p>
                    <p>1. Secret—Entire text.</p>
                    <p>2. Thus far the administration has struck the right balance in the delicate
                        and evolving situation in Poland. As you know, we still lack the basic
                        information that would enable us to draw conclusions on what the imposition
                        of martial law in Poland means for the future of the political reform
                        process there. I believe, and there is intelligence information to
                        substantiate my view, that the Soviets were involved in yesterday’s events
                        and that this could be a prelude to a further internal crackdown.
                        Nevertheless, the pressures for reform in Poland remain high and it is
                        simply too soon to judge whether the process of political liberalization has
                        come to an end. It is thus vital, at this stage, to keep all our options
                        open.</p>
                    <p>3. For this reason, we must avoid two extremes in our policy-making as well
                        as our public posture. On the one hand, we must not incite internal violence
                        which could lead to full-scale civil war and further repression. At the same
                        time, because we don’t know how the Polish authorities intend to proceed, in
                        the period ahead we cannot allow ourselves to acquiesce in internal or
                        external repression in Poland.</p>
                    <p>4. In these circumstances, we must avoid taking any premature decisions
                        toward Poland on such issues as food aid, trade and debt rescheduling. As a
                        result I have asked that all such actions now underway be held in abeyance
                        for the immediate future. It is important that we preserve our leverage on
                        the Polish Government, making use of it as we can in the weeks ahead to
                        apply pressure against domestic repression and encourage moderation and
                        reform. Some of our allies may decide to adopt a business-as-usual attitude
                        before it is clear precisely what the Polish Government intends to do, but
                        we must continue to exercise leadership on this issue. Thus, I have
                        instructed our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Ambassador, Tap
                        Bennett, in the special session of the North Atlantic Council today, to
                        avoid any hasty decisions by the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>5. I am also making sure that this posture is maintained in the negotiations
                        we are currently conducting in Geneva (INF) and Madrid (<gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss>). At Madrid I am asking our Chief
                        Delegate, Max Kampleman, <pb n="388" facs="0419" xml:id="pg_388"/>to inform
                        our allies and friends that in view of the uncertain events in Poland we
                        cannot conclude an agreement on confidence-building measures and human
                        rights at this time. (Such an agreement was in any case highly unlikely.) At
                        Geneva, we should continue the INF talks until popular reaction in Poland
                        crystalizes or until the Soviet role is clarified. For now, I am instructing
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPH_1">Paul Nitze</persName> to inform the Soviets
                        in private that their conduct vis-a-vis Poland could affect the course of
                        those negotiations.</p>
                    <p>6. These steps are designed to give us maximum flexibility in what is clearly
                        a very fluid situation in Poland. Only through this tactic will you preserve
                        your ability to influence the Polish authorities or Soviet behavior in the
                        days ahead. While avoiding excessive rhetoric, we must continue to express
                        our serious concern about the future of political reform in Poland. Of
                        course, in order for us to preserve all our options, it will be necessary to
                        maintain tight discipline over public statements as well as our own
                        decision-making process, particularly since some of our critics may well
                        attempt to exploit this situation for partisan political purposes.</p>
                    <p>7. I will be returning from Brussels this afternoon and will be in touch with
                        you upon my arrival.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>After dinner at the British Embassy December 18, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> and I had a private conversation
                        about Poland. I stressed our great concern about the repression in Poland,
                        the arrests of Solidarity officials and others and said that, as both the
                        President and the Secretary have underlined, it is essential that moves be
                        made urgently in the direction of reconciliation and compromise. <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Jaruzelski</persName> had said that the process of
                        renewal would be conducted but we see no signs of that. If the present
                        situation continued, I said it would inevitably have an adverse impact on
                        U.S.-Soviet relations, since the influence of the Soviets in Poland was
                        overwhelming. I said that any intervention by the Soviets themselves of
                        course would have an even greater negative effect.</p>
                    <pb n="390" facs="0421" xml:id="pg_390"/>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> claimed that <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Jaruzelski</persName> is a strong Polish nationalist
                        who was acting in the best interests of the Polish nation. Much had been
                        tolerated in Poland, but, particularly with the meeting in Radom of
                        Solidarity, it had become clear that the real aim of Solidarity was to seize
                        political power in Poland. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        said that this was beyond the limit of acceptability. He stated that the
                        Soviets would not object if Solidarity wished to form a strong trade union,
                        conduct strikes there and institute self management in Polish factories. All
                        of this could be tolerated but an effort to take over political power could
                        not.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> defended the use of force by
                        the Polish regime, saying that all governments have the right to defend the
                        state structure and to preserve law and order. He also said that, as we have
                        seen, the Soviets have been moderate and restrained in their attitude. Not
                        one Soviet soldier has participated in any of the events in Poland.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> claimed that the Soviets have
                        given five billion dollars in hard currency assistance to Poland in addition
                        to raw materials and other commodities. He saw no reason why the U.S. should
                        not continue its assistance to Poland.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> felt that the U.S. position
                        concerning Polish developments had been moderate and responsible, although
                        he noted that the President’s statement the previous day had been notably
                        sharper in tone.<note n="2" xml:id="d120fn2">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s statement at the start of his

                            1161–1170)</note> He acknowledged, however, that the President refused
                        to get into details of options open for action. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> felt that this was a good thing. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> stressed his hope that both the
                        U.S. and the Soviet Union would look at developments in Poland without
                        emotion and would not permit them to be the cause for deterioration of our
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>I observed that there is already a great deal of emotion in this country
                        about the Polish events. The fact that we have so many people in this
                        country of Polish origin adds to the strength of these sentiments. When we
                        observe the repression taking place in Poland it is inevitable that emotions
                        will rise and that pressures on the government to do something about the
                        situation will increase. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        rejoined that the Soviet people also have emotions. They remember how many
                        Soviet soldiers were killed in liberating Poland from the Nazis and they are
                        profoundly upset by what has been happening in Poland over the last year and
                        a half.</p>
                    <p>In concluding the conversation, I reiterated our great concern and stressed
                        again the necessity of establishing dialogue in Poland between <pb n="391" facs="0422" xml:id="pg_391"/>the authorities, Solidarity, and the Church
                        which could lead to a process of reconciliation.</p>

                        Poland. These meetings featured a vigorous debate between Secretary of State
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Alexander Haig</persName>, who advocated
                        restraint and limited economic sanctions, and Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Caspar Weinberger</persName> and Ambassador to the

                        who advocated that the President embark upon a sustained rhetorical campaign
                        against the Soviet Union and cripple the construction of the Siberian
                        pipeline. On December 21, the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> met in
                        the Roosevelt Room of the White House from 10:30 to 11:48 a.m. to discuss
                        what message to send Moscow. “I cannot make a ‛Santa Claus is Coming to
                        Town’ speech in this environment,” <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> stated at the end of the meeting. “The letter to

                        It could address the fact that they haven’t been able to provide their
                        people the living standard they would like and that they would be in an even
                        worse plight without trade (with the West). We could say that we cannot
                        continue trade (if events in Poland continue) and that we will press our
                        Allies to follow us unless the Polish situation is alleviated. But again
                        holding out our hand. Can he envision what it would be like if trade with
                        the West were open? It would be a different, much better, world. He can have
                        that one, giving up nothing, or the one that will result if we are forced to
                        take trade-cutting actions.” (Minutes of a National Security Council

                        After a discussion of the draft Presidential address on the situation in
                        Poland, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> remarked: “Not enough
                        in this is directed against the Soviet Union. We must say that they are
                        responsible.” <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> continued: “We
                        can say that martial law was being printed in October in Moscow and imposed
                        in Poland in December.” After further discussion of the speech and a broader
                        public diplomacy campaign, as well as the possibility of appealing to the
                        United Nations, <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Meese</persName> urged members
                        of the administration to keep the White House signal board apprised of their
                        whereabouts over the Christmas break, in case the situation in Poland
                        deteriorated further. (Reagan Library, Executive Secretariat, <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>: <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>

                        <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>The recent events in Poland have filled the people of the United States and
                        me with dismay. Since the imposition of martial law on December 13, the most
                        elementary rights of the Polish people have been violated daily: massive
                        arrests without any legal procedures; incarcerations of trade union leaders
                        and intellectuals in overcrowded jails and freezing detention camps;
                        suspension of all rights of assembly and association; and, last but not
                        least, brutal assaults by security forces on citizens.</p>
                    <p>The recent events in Poland clearly are not an “internal matter” and in
                        writing to you, as the head of the Soviet Government, I am not misaddressing
                        my communication. Your country has repeatedly intervened in Polish affairs
                        during the months preceding the recent tragic events. No clearer proof of
                        such intervention is needed than the letter of June 5, 1981,<note n="2" xml:id="d122fn2">See “Soviet Party Letter to Warsaw Leaders Voicing
                            Concern Over Polish Situation,” <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>,
                            June 11, 1981, p. A8.</note> from the Central Committee of the <gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss> to the Polish leadership which warned
                        the Poles that the Soviet Union could not tolerate developments there. There
                        were numerous other communications of this nature which placed pressure on
                        the Polish Government and depicted the reform movement as a threat to the
                        “vital interests” of all Socialist countries. These communications,
                        accompanied by a steady barrage of media assaults as well as military
                        exercises along Poland’s borders, were coupled with warnings of intervention
                        unless the Polish Government sharply restricted the liberties and rights
                        which it was granting its citizens.</p>
                    <p>All these actions represented a clear violation of many international
                        agreements to which the Soviet Union is a signatory. Let me only mention one
                        provision of the Helsinki Final Act which you, Mr. President, personally
                        initialed on behalf of your country in 1975. There you have agreed with
                        other countries to refrain “from any intervention, direct or indirect,
                        individual or collective in the internal or external <pb n="394" facs="0425" xml:id="pg_394"/>affairs falling within the domestic jurisdiction of
                        another participating state, regardless of their mutual relations.”</p>
                    <p>Our two countries have had moments of accord and moments of disagreement but
                        since Afghanistan nothing has so outraged our public opinion as the
                        pressures and threats which your government has exerted on Poland to stifle
                        the stirrings of freedom.</p>
                    <p>Attempts to suppress the Polish people—either by the Polish army and police
                        acting under Soviet pressure, or through even more direct use of Soviet
                        military force—certainly will not bring about long-term stability in Poland
                        and could unleash a process which neither you nor we could fully
                        control.</p>
                    <p>The only sensible solution is to allow the Polish Government and people to
                        begin a process of reconciliation, and to do so now, before the situation
                        deteriorates further. This cannot be done in the present atmosphere of
                        political terror, mass arrests and bloodshed. Representatives of the
                        spiritual, political and social forces in Poland need to be promptly
                        released from detention and a new national dialogue initiated. This is as
                        essential to solving Poland’s major economic problems as it is to healing
                        its political wounds. It is the sole path to long-term stability in Poland
                        and therefore in Europe as a whole.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union can either acknowledge the need for this process or continue
                        to prevent it. The consequences of each of these courses for our
                        relationship should be clear.</p>
                    <p>Over the course of 1981 we have begun to develop a framework, to guide our
                        relations in the years to come. In Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s last meeting with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  <note n="3" xml:id="d122fn3">See
                                <ref target="#d91">Document 91</ref>.</note> and in my last letter
                        to you,<note n="4" xml:id="d122fn4">See <ref target="#d103">Document
                                103</ref>.</note> we set forth a concrete agenda for negotiations on
                        critical regional and arms control issues. It has been our hope and
                        intention to proceed in 1982 to try to achieve specific progress on each
                        item on this agenda.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union must decide whether we can move ahead with this agenda, or
                        whether we will travel a different path. The heavy responsibility of the
                        Soviet Union for the present repression in Poland threatens to undermine the
                        basis for an improvement in our relationship. We recognize the interest of
                        the Soviet Union in a stable Poland. But a process of reconciliation and
                        moderate reform in Poland represents no threat to the Soviet Union. The
                        United States cannot accept suppression of the Polish peoples legitimate
                        desire for such a process of renewal, particularly when it is imposed under
                        external pressure. Should the Soviet Union persist in aiding the course of
                        continued <pb n="395" facs="0426" xml:id="pg_395"/>suppression in Poland,
                        the United States will have no choice but to take concrete measures
                        affecting the full range of our relationship.</p>
                    <p>Soviet actions in the days and weeks ahead will determine our decisions. As
                        leaders of two great and powerful nations, we bear a mutual obligation to
                        demonstrate wisdom, moderation and restraint. Let me assure you that I am
                        prepared to join in the process of helping to heal Poland’s wounds and to
                        meet its real needs if you are prepared to reciprocate. I call upon you to
                        make clear that you understand the need for national reconciliation in
                        Poland. The alternative is not in the interest of anyone.</p>
                    <p>I hope to hear from you in the next few days.</p>

                    <p>Attached is a letter we have just received from <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> over <gloss target="#t_MOLINK_1">MOLINK</gloss>. We
                        have had it translated here in the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>. As
                        you will see, it is abrasive, and accuses you of gross interference in the
                        internal affairs of Poland and Russia. However, the interesting part of the
                        letter is that it is not as abrasive as some previously received from
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> and asks that we talk.
                        It tries to minimize our differences over Poland as being secondary to
                        overall U.S./Soviet relations and the need for arms control agreements. He
                        hints in response to your assertion we would be forced to take certain
                        actions toward the Soviet Union if <pb n="396" facs="0427" xml:id="pg_396"/>it persisted in pressuring Poland, that so little is left in U.S./Soviet
                        collaboration anyway that your threat isn’t very frightening. The tacit
                        assumption of the letter is that an irreversible change has taken place in
                        Poland’s reverting to the Soviet model, that Poland therefore has ceased to
                        be a “problem”, and the U.S. and the Soviet Union should go on to other
                        issues.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>Your address on the Direct Communications Link has made all the more pressing
                        the necessity to call upon you and the government of the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> to put a final end to the interference in
                        the internal affairs of a sovereign state—the Polish People’s Republic. This
                        interference in its various forms—overt and covert—has continued for a long
                        time.</p>
                    <pb n="397" facs="0428" xml:id="pg_397"/>
                    <p>In your current letter, you have placed your personal signature upon the fact
                        that gross interference in the internal affairs of Poland is the official
                        policy of the United States. We have condemned and continue to condemn such
                        a policy and consider it unacceptable.</p>
                    <p>Attempting to mask this policy, you did not address the point of the letter
                        of the Central Committee of our Party dated 5 June of this year, which was
                        sent to the Central Committee of the <gloss target="#t_PZPR_1">PZPR</gloss>
                        (Polish United Worker’s Party). Not to mention the fact that in so doing you
                        distorted its sense, you again speak from the position of interference in
                        the mutual relations between two political parties—the <gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_PZPR_1">PZPR</gloss>, between whom, there exists their own completely equal and
                        friendly norms and procedures of contact. Such procedures are not new.</p>
                    <p>If a frank exchange of opinions between Communist parties and the expressions
                        by them of their opinions to each other is not pleasing to someone in the
                        United States, then, in reply, we must firmly say: that is the business of
                        the parties themselves and only them. And the Polish people do not sit in
                        judgment of others, who would force their values on them.</p>
                    <p>It is especially important to emphasize such a principal point.</p>
                    <p>From the standpoint of our party, antipathy has been, and continues to be,
                        expressed in relation to those in Poland who are enemies of the existing
                        system there and who break the laws and violate the law and order of the
                        country and are plunging it into chaos.</p>
                    <p>You, yourself, as head of the state and government of the United States, are
                        speaking out against the existing state system in Poland; in other words,
                        you favor the overthrow of this system. This has not been imagined, but is
                        the most real interference in the internal affairs of another sovereign
                        state.</p>
                    <p>And this is taking place not only in relation to Poland. Similar attempts are
                        also being undertaken in relation to the Soviet Union. American officials,
                        yes, even you personally, are defaming our social and state system, our
                        internal order. We resolutely repudiate this.</p>
                    <p>In the light of these and many other generally known facts, what then remains
                        of your discussions concerning our alleged participation in the internal
                        events in Poland? Nothing remains.</p>
                    <p>In your address is quoted the good provision of the Helsinki Final Act upon
                        which was placed not only my signature but also the signature of the
                        President of the United States. Yes, this provision stipulates the restraint
                        from any interference in the affairs which concern the internal competence
                        of another state, which, by the way, is the only way to refer to the
                        unacceptability of the United States advancing any sort of demand regarding
                        the introduction of martial law by the highest Polish organs in accordance
                        with the state constitution and the attempt of the <pb n="398" facs="0429" xml:id="pg_398"/>United States to dictate to the Poles what they should
                        and should not do.<note n="4" xml:id="d123fn4">In an undated handwritten

                            we should interfere with what the Poles and Polish authorities are doing

                            would have? The Soviets violated that pact. <gloss target="#t_RR_1">RR</gloss>.” (Ibid.) The text of this note is similar to the entry
                            in <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s personal diary for
                            that day. (Brinkley, ed., <hi rend="italic">The <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Diaries</hi>, Vol. I, p.
                            96)</note>
                  </p>
                    <p>No one should interfere with what the Poles and the Polish authorities are
                        doing and will do in their own home.</p>
                    <p>Instead of letting the Poles themselves decide, you aspire to decide for them
                        by what means and how the Polish society should develop further. But the
                        social order in Poland was chosen not by Washington, not by Moscow, and not
                        by any other capital, but by the Poles themselves. No one can direct the
                        leadership of Poland on how to conduct their own affairs or which methods
                        will more quickly and better stabilize the situation in the country.</p>
                    <p>Attempts to dictate your will to other states are in gross contradiction to
                        the elementary norms of international law. I would like to say further: they
                        are thoroughly amoral. And no sort of game with words regarding the rights
                        of man can hide this fact.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union repudiates the claims of anyone to interfere in the events
                        occurring in Poland.</p>
                    <p>In your letter there is mentioned the military maneuvers near Poland. You
                        clearly wish to make your own interpretations about these maneuvers and
                        apply them to the situation in Poland. But this is completely unfounded
                        conjecture.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of military maneuvers, the question arises: How many maneuvers have
                        the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> countries, including the USA,
                        conducted and continue to conduct in Western Europe near the borders of the
                            <gloss target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss> and Czechoslovakia? Could they
                            (<gloss target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss> and Czechoslovakia) not then
                        present to the United States their assessment of this situation? And could
                        we not assess such maneuvers as a threat to the Soviet Union and to other
                        Socialist countries?</p>
                    <p>Such is the worth of your references to the military maneuvers.</p>
                    <p>You, Mr. President, hint that if the further events in Poland should develop
                        in a manner unsatisfactory to the United States, damage will be inflicted
                        along the entire range of Soviet-American relations.</p>
                    <pb n="399" facs="0430" xml:id="pg_399"/>
                    <p>But if we are to speak frankly, it is your administration that has already
                        done enough to disrupt or at the very least undermine everything positive
                        which was achieved at the cost of great effort by previous American
                        administrations in the relations between our countries. Today,
                        unfortunately, little remains of the reciprocal positive political gains
                        which were achieved earlier.</p>
                    <p>But what is the use of making allusions of this type? Perhaps, before
                        resorting to them, it would be better to weigh everything calmly.</p>
                    <p>But one cannot help but notice that the general tone of your letter is not
                        the way in which leaders of such powers as the Soviet Union and the United
                        States should talk with each other, especially considering their power and
                        position in the world and their responsibility for the state of
                        international affairs. This is our opinion.</p>
                    <p>It is not us, not the Soviet Union, which would bear responsibility should
                        the futher undermining of Soviet-American relations take place.</p>
                    <p>It seems that it would be much more useful if the problems which are vitally
                        important for peoples were objectively discussed by the leadership of the
                        Soviet Union and the United States. Such problems as how to restrain and
                        halt the arms race, which has already acquired an irrational tempo and
                        scale, and how to preserve peace on earth.</p>
                    <p>It is precisely these problems which should occupy the center of attention of
                        the leadership of our countries and which should find a reasonable solution.
                        I propose, and am even convinced, that the American people need this no less
                        than the Soviet and other people.</p>

                        from making excessive concessions when he decides to reopen the dialogue
                        with Solidarity (which the Soviets accept as unavoidable). In our view the
                        Soviets will <hi rend="italic">not press for further top-level leadership

                        They probably will provide a <hi rend="italic">modest, but steady flow of
                            economic assistance</hi> to avert food riots and the like which could
                        undercut martial law’s prospects, and necessitate direct Soviet
                        intervention. They may also be more willing, with martial law succeeding, to

                            rescheduling operation from going under</hi>.</p>
                    <p>In all this, <hi rend="italic">the Soviets are likely to allow <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Jaruzelski</persName> considerable leeway in how

                        attempting a Kadar-type solution in Poland (a Party hard-liner imposing
                        reforms from above) would not get the Poles to work, meaning a decade or
                        more of economic stagnation and, by extension, of total Soviet
                        subsidization. The Soviets may therefore be <hi rend="italic">prepared to
                            see a return to the status quo of the early post-August, 1980
                            period</hi> (<hi rend="italic">“strict observance of the Gdansk

               </p>
                    <p>The political character of the “new” Solidarity will clearly be at the top of
                        the bargaining agenda not only among Poles, but between Poles and Soviets.
                        Moscow would no doubt prefer a thoroughly tame Solidarity, but they can <hi rend="italic">probably be brought to acquiesce in a Solidarity with
                            considerable autonomy on economic issues</hi>, including a role in
                        worker self-management a la Yugoslavia, and the right to strike over
                        economic issues. The Soviets would be banking on the hope that, with the
                        experience of martial law, Solidarity moderates would be able effectively to
                        isolate the radicals, and the union’s political inclinations would be
                        self-contained. <hi rend="italic">A partial reversal of the crackdown along

                    <p>The Soviets will probably try to counter our sanctions and stave off similar

                    <p>Outside of Europe, the Soviets may be tempted to respond to our sanctions by

                            Somalia, or Southern Africa</hi>. Although the Soviets probably feel
                        over-exposed as it is, with Poland and Afghanistan to worry about, this is a
                        real possibility we should be prepared for. It is also <hi rend="italic">possible that the Soviets will make an effort to appear more
                            cooperative on other aspects of East-West dialogue</hi>, such as on the

                        <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> said the situation in Poland
                        is difficult to predict and is unlikely to be clarified in the near term.
                        Despite reports of general calm in the country, passive resistance and low
                        worker productivity prevail. Some Solidarity members remain free while
                        Polish authorities have acknowledged five thousand Poles have been detained;
                        Lech Walesa remains in custody near Warsaw. Contrary to Polish claims,
                        reliable sources indicate that no negotiations with Solidarity are underway
                        nor does the Church feel that its talks with Polish authorities amount to
                        negotiations. Polish authorities will try to put a better face on the
                        situation perhaps by releasing more detainees and easing up on the more
                        onerous aspects of martial law, but it could remain in effect for several
                        more months, and the basic elements of the situation may well remain
                        unchanged.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Soviet Union:</hi> There is no question of the role played
                        by the Soviets who had long been pressuring the Poles to crack down. It was
                        the second best and second worst solution for them: while the optimum for
                        the Soviets would have been for the Poles to crush Solidarity politically
                        without recourse to military force, the option selected was preferable to
                        direct Soviet military intervention. The President’s decision to impose
                        sanctions against the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was based on
                        the clear evidence of Soviet involvement in the repression in Poland. The
                        sanctions announced December 29 include:</p>
                    <p>1. The suspension of Aeroflot services in the US.</p>

                    <p>2. The closure of the Soviet (formerly known as Kama) Purchasing Commission.
                        Its staff has been told to leave the country by January 20. In response to a
                        query from the <gloss target="#t_FBI_1">FBI</gloss> representative,
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> said that those staff
                        members would not be allowed to adjust their status.</p>
                    <p>3. Suspension of issuance or renewal of licenses to export electronic
                        equipment, computers and high technology to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. Postponement of a start to negotiations on a new Long Term Agreement
                            (<gloss target="#t_LTA_1">LTA</gloss>) on grain sales to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. The current one year extension of the

                        September 30, 1982.</p>
                    <p>5. Suspension of negotiations on a new Maritime Agreement. The old Maritime
                        Agreement expired December 31 and a more restrictive regime of Soviet access
                        to US ports went into effect at that time. <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> noted that we are taking into consideration undue

                        interests during this transitional period.</p>
                    <p>6. Suspension of licenses required for export to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> of an expanded list of oil and gas
                        equipment (including pipelayers).</p>

                            commenced at 1605 EST with the President at the ranch,” <persName corresp="#p_PJM_1">Poindexter</persName> wrote in a December 28
                            memorandum for the record. “The President approved all recommendations
                            in subject memo. Oil and gas equipment will be on the foreign policy
                            control list for the time being. The President is still considering the
                            action to be taken with respect to the International Harvester combine
                            contract.” (National Security Council, Box SR 118, <gloss target="#t_SSG_1">SSG</gloss> 0005 RWR 12/28/81 Poland)</note> The
                        President’s language (“suspend”, “postpone”) deliberately implied the
                        reversibility of the sanctions should events in Poland warrant it. <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> noted the President’s commitment
                        to maintaining the US-Soviet dialogue including the arms control process
                        (INF, <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>). Preparations are now
                        underway for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s
                        January 26–27 meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> in which Poland will obviously
                        figure prominently.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Allied position:</hi>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> acknowledged that
                        differences exist among the Allies about how to deal with Soviet
                        involvement, but he felt the press had probably exaggerated them. The US was
                        encouraged by the EC Ministers’ agreement not to undercut our sanctions as
                        well by the <pb n="405" facs="0436" xml:id="pg_405"/>stronger position taken
                        by Chancellor Schmidt after his meeting with the President. The U.S. is
                        working on a common Alliance position towards the Soviets which <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> expected would be adopted by the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Foreign Ministers when they meet
                        in Brussels on January 11.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Exchanges:</hi> Turning to exchanges, <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> reiterated that it is essential
                        for all agencies to be neither behind nor ahead of the exchange related
                        steps selected by the White House. The sanctions were carefully calibrated
                        to put a measured degree of pressure on the Soviets and to keep some
                        punitive measures in reserve. Activities should be examined on a
                        case-by-case basis. We would be prepared to cut out some activities which
                        appear contrary to the spirit of the sanctions, such as the computer-related
                        exchanges under the Science and Technology agreement. <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> informed representatives that they
                        would shortly receive guidelines for a new review of exchange agreements.
                        This is a useful exercise in its own right; we might want to cut those areas
                        where the balance of benefits is unfavorable whether or not international
                        concerns so dictated. On the other side of the coin, such a review could
                        yield convincing arguments to continue an agreement or activities. In this
                        connection, <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> confirmed that
                        this review would include those agreements which are not to be renewed under
                        the Dec. 29 sanctions. There is no general policy obstacle to continuation
                        of activities under those agreements until they actually lapse next
                        summer.</p>
                    <p>Various agencies expressed appreciation for <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName>’s clarification. The <gloss target="#t_DOE_1">DOE</gloss> representative noted that his agency would now reconsider
                        an earlier <gloss target="#t_DOE_1">DOE</gloss> memo which had mandated
                        immediate cessation of all activities with the Soviets. Several
                        representatives said that a State Department memo to agency heads embodying
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName>’s clarification on
                        exchanges policy would be very useful, particularly in view of intense
                        budget pressures. The <gloss target="#t_OSTP_1">OSTP</gloss> representative
                        felt that such a memo might be viewed as undercutting the President’s
                        sanctions; the <gloss target="#t_NSF_1">NSF</gloss> representative pointed
                        out that any possible further steps to reduce exchanges could be carried out
                        by simply reprogramming allocated funds whereas it would be difficult to
                        restore funds which might be slashed merely in anticipation of hypothetical
                        moves. <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> promised that we
                        would follow up on the possibility of a State memo.</p>
                    <p>Hurwitz (State, <gloss target="#t_EURSOV_1">EUR/SOV</gloss>) urged all
                        representatives to use caution with their Soviet contacts on the question of
                        exchanges; the best tack is simply to refer them to the President’s
                        statement.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USDA_1">USDA</gloss> representative asked whether the
                            <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would attempt to curtail
                        privately-sponsored US exchanges with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> replied
                        that while officially the US could neither encourage nor discourage such
                        exchanges, depending on the circumstances, we could jawbone private
                        sponsors.</p>
                    <p>The Interior representative raised the longstanding agreement the US Bureau
                        of Mines had with its Polish counterpart and asked whether <pb n="406" facs="0437" xml:id="pg_406"/>this cooperation could continue. Noting
                        that he was not familiar with the details of this arrangement, <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> asked that Interior discuss the
                        case later with State officials. He noted, however, that the US had no
                        desire to sever the contacts and relationships the US had developed with
                        Polish institutions and individuals.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> reiterated guidance on

                    <p>This group seems so pleased with its success that it now plans to expand its

                        remains committed to a high-level dialogue with your country, and we still
                        hope to be able to make progress on the agenda of regional and arms control
                        issues established by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                        and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> in their
                        September meetings.</p>
                    <p>—Your actions with respect to Poland in the coming weeks will be taken by us
                        as an indication of whether your country is sincerely committed to moving
                        the US-Soviet relationship forward.</p>
                    <p>—In this regard, I would like to reiterate what Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> about the jamming of Voice of
                        America broadcasts in Polish which has been taking place in the past several
                        weeks from facilities within the Soviet Union, specifically from Kharkov,
                        Kaliningrad, and a location near Moscow. This activity is totally
                        unacceptable.</p>
                    <p>—Such jamming (for that matter, all jamming) is a flagrant violation of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s commitments under the Helsinki
                        Final Act, Article 35 of the International Telecommunication Convention, and
                        Article 19 of the U.N. Human Rights Declaration.</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts do not subversive [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] activity as has been repeatedly alleged in crude
                        propaganda attacks by the Soviet media. <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        carries objective news and information now denied Polish people by their own
                        government-controlled press.</p>
                    <p>—We demand that these illegal jamming activities cease immediately. As we
                        have stated in the past, we reserve the right to take <pb n="409" facs="0440" xml:id="pg_409"/>necessary and appropriate actions to
                        protect our broadcasting interests, should the jamming continue.</p>
                    <p>4. Cuba/Central America:</p>
                    <p>—We have carefully reviewed President <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s October 16 [<hi rend="italic">15</hi>] letter to
                        President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                  <note n="5" xml:id="d127fn5">See <ref target="#d93">Document 93</ref>.</note>
                        calling on us to leave Cuba alone and normalize relations with it and
                        asserting that Cuba represents no threat to the vital interests of the
                        United States. We note further that President <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> made the same points in his December 1 letter to
                        President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>.<note n="6" xml:id="d127fn6">See <ref target="#d108">Document 108</ref>.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>—In response to this and other denials of hostile Cuban activity, we must
                        affirm that Cuba’s actions do represent a threat, not only to the United
                        States, but to the vital interest that all nations have in maintaining peace
                        and reducing tensions. I want—in response to President <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s letters—to outline to you the
                        areas in which Cuba’s actions cause us serious concern. I do this in the
                        context of looking for means to reduce tensions.</p>
                    <p>—Because Cuban activities would collapse without Soviet support, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> bears a special responsibility for
                        Cuba’s continuing threat to peace. Cuba’s aggressive interventions in Africa
                        and the Caribbean are not acceptable to us. The purpose of any talks with
                        Cuba can only be to end this unacceptable behavior. In that context the U.S.
                        would be ready to address Cuba’s interests. At the same time, U.S.-Soviet
                        relations will continue to be damaged unless Cuba and its friends begin to
                        act responsibly.</p>
                    <p>The following Cuban activities are of primary concern to us:</p>
                    <p>. . continued Cuban troop presence in Angola and Cuban refusal to withdraw
                        troops in parallel with South African withdrawal from Namibia. Given recent
                        forward movement toward an internationally acceptable settlement, attention
                        must focus on this obstacle. The chance to remove it is a real opportunity
                        for statesmanship;</p>
                    <p>. . maintenance of Cuban forces in Ethiopia and South Yemen;</p>
                    <p>. . the build-up of military forces in Cuba capable of projecting power
                        beyond the environs of the island;</p>
                    <p>. . Cuban interference in the internal affairs of El Salvador, Guatemala,
                        Honduras, and Colombia through support of guerrilla groups;</p>
                    <p>. . Cuban dispatch of larger numbers of military and security personnel to
                        Nicaragua, its assistance in the Nicaraguan Armed Forces’ build-up to levels
                        endangering regional security, and its cooperation <pb n="410" facs="0441" xml:id="pg_410"/>with guerrilla groups which use Nicaragua as a
                        headquarters and supply center.</p>
                    <p>—I hope to discuss each in detail in coming weeks. Today I would like to talk
                        in more detail about Nicaragua:</p>
                    <p>. . Of the 5500–6000 Cuban advisors now in Nicaragua, some 1800 are military
                        and security personnel. This stands in sharp contrast to our 35 military
                        instructors in El Salvador.</p>
                    <p>. . The continued flow of arms and ammunition into Nicaragua has facilitated
                        a build-up of Nicaragua’s Armed Forces to regionally unprecedented
                        levels—three times the size of Somoza’s Armed Forces (24,000 active duty
                        personnel, 50,000 reserve forces/militia; southern neighbor Costa Rica has
                        no Armed Forces, Northern neighbor Honduras has 11,000). Realization of
                        plans to have 50,000 active duty personnel and 200,000 reservists/militia
                        would be profoundly destabilizing to the region.</p>
                    <p>. . Nicaraguan Foreign Minister D’Escoto has told Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> that Soviet Combat Aircraft will not
                        be delivered. This is good news. A moratorium on delivery of additional
                        weapons and ammunition in general would be a sign of good faith that there
                        is no intention to disrupt the regional military balance. An understanding
                        not to provide additional heavy offensive weapons would also be useful.</p>
                    <p>. . But this, in itself, is not enough. Other elements of the problem are
                        equally important. At present, the more than 1,500 Cuban military and
                        internal-security advisors in Nicaragua contribute to regional concern over
                        excessive Nicaraguan military expansion, Sandinista persecution of
                        independent elements of the population, and support for foreign guerrillas.
                        The number of these advisors should be immediately reduced to minimal
                        levels.</p>
                    <p>. . A further threat to the region is created by the Salvadoran and other
                        guerrilla groups which maintain their headquarters and communications
                        facilities in and receive their arms from Nicaragua. These foreign guerrilla
                        activities in Nicaragua, which are supported by Cuba and which aim at
                        interfering in the internal affairs of other states, should cease.</p>
                    <p>—Unless the situation in Central America is altered in some of the ways I
                        have suggested, the tension characterizing the region will continue and will
                        build. The prospect of a wider and more serious confrontation is real. It is
                        not a prospect we seek; it is not a prospect we welcome. We wish to see
                        early significant changes in the pattern of activities I have described. I
                        welcome your thoughts.</p>

                        raise subject of Afghanistan, you should underline our concern over recent
                        Soviet troop reinforcements and continued Soviet pressure on Pakistan and
                        indicate that any <pb n="411" facs="0442" xml:id="pg_411"/>Soviet escalation
                        of the Afghanistan conflict will provoke a response. You should not,
                        however, be drawn into discussion of <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s October 31 demarche to the Secretary<note n="7" xml:id="d127fn7">See <ref target="#d109">Document 109</ref>.</note> or

                    <p>1. S—Entire text</p>
                    <p>2. Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> called
                        in Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> on
                        Sunday, January 10 to make demarche on Soviet delivery of additional
                        advanced MIG aircraft to Cuba. In upcoming meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> should reiterate points in
                        demarche in context of larger presentation on Cuba/Central America contained
                        in existing instructions.</p>
                    <p>3. Begin text of demarche:</p>
                    <p>—My government wishes to register its deep concern about recent Soviet
                        actions with respect to Cuba.</p>
                    <pb n="412" facs="0443" xml:id="pg_412"/>
                    <p>—U.S. intelligence has detected the arrival in Cuba of additional numbers of
                        advanced Soviet fighter aircraft which, based on our present information,
                        are of either the MIG–23 or MIG–27 type.</p>
                    <p>—Soviet provision of these aircraft is part of a pattern of Soviet arms
                        transfers to Cuba involving increasingly sophisticated military capabilities
                        which far exceed the requirements of Cuban defense.</p>
                    <p>—The latest deliveries of advanced MIG interceptors and ground-attack
                        aircraft, moreover, are occurring in the context of a continuing escalation
                        in Soviet arms transfers to the region as a whole—including a massive and
                        unjustified build-up of Nicaragua’s military potential—that we view as
                        affecting our security interests.</p>
                    <p>—The presence in Cuba of additional advanced MIG aircraft is of particular
                        concern in view of the fact that aircraft of these types can be equipped for
                        nuclear weapons, and because the conversion of non-nuclear variants of these
                        aircraft to carry nuclear weapons can be accomplished rapidly.</p>
                    <p>—This pattern of Soviet arms transfer activity, in our view, raises questions
                        with regard to the US-Soviet understandings on Cuba.</p>
                    <p>—As Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> emphasized to
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> in New
                            York,<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2">See <ref target="#d90">Document
                                90</ref>.</note> the current pattern of Soviet arms transfers to
                        this hemisphere represents a major obstacle to an improvement in the
                        US-Soviet relationship.</p>
                    <p>End text of demarche</p>
                    <p>4. Following presentation of demarche, the Acting Secretary said that the
                        U.S. would be raising this issue at the highest levels of the Soviet
                        Government—specifically, during Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s January meetings with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. He added that, while the U.S. had no intention of
                        publicizing the matter, it was possible that the story could leak. If so,
                        our public position would be that we view the problem with great concern and
                        have raised it with the Soviet Government. We would not comment publicly on
                        any of the specifics of our demarche.</p>
                    <p>5. By way of a preliminary response, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that the Soviet Government would consider the
                        demarche solely within the context of the US-Soviet understandings. As far
                        as arms deliveries to Cuba were concerned, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> had proposed many times that the two sides hold talks on
                        conventional arms transfers. In fact, negotiations had been initiated—which
                        were to have considered all regions, including Latin America—but they had
                        been broken off by the U.S. side (a reference to the 1978 <gloss target="#t_CAT_1">CAT</gloss> talks).</p>
                    <pb n="413" facs="0444" xml:id="pg_413"/>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that he was not in a
                        position to comment on whether the aircraft cited by the U.S. had actually
                        been delivered to Cuba, or whether they could in fact be converted to carry
                        nuclear weapons. But the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was free to
                        sell arms to Cuba, just as the U.S. sold arms all over the world. There was
                        no US-Soviet agreement limiting any conventional arms transfers. So there
                        were no grounds for the U.S. to ask anything of the Soviet Union in this
                        respect.</p>
                    <p>7. As far as the US-Soviet understandings on Cuba were concerned, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he would convey the U.S.
                        concerns to Moscow. The Acting Secretary interjected to repeat that the U.S.
                        demarche said that the pattern of Soviet activity “raises questions” with
                        respect to the understandings. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that the Soviet military would have to look at
                        this question.</p>
                    <p>8. In leaving <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked the
                        Acting Secretary what was the U.S. thinking thus far with regard to the
                        agenda for the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> meetings, apart from the Cuba
                        issue. In particular, would there be a discussion of strategic arms
                        negotiations, leading to some sort of announcement on negotiations. The
                        Acting Secretary said that <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> would
                        certainly be discussed, as well as Poland and the other issues discussed at
                        the September meetings. As far as any announcements were concerned, the
                        Acting Secretary added, he could not say.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary of State has recommended that direct Presidential action, in
                        the form of a message from you to President <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> (Tab A) on behalf of the two Pentecostalists on a
                        hunger strike in our Moscow Embassy, may be our only remaining chance to
                        bring the fast to an end. Our fears for the health and ultimately the lives
                        of these two Christian women, Mrs. Augustina Vashchenko and her daughter,
                        Lidiya, have sharpened as it has become clear that neither we nor their many
                        other supporters in this country can persuade them to end their hunger
                        strike.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Vashchenko and Lidiya, who have been living in refuge in our Embassy in
                        Moscow for the last three and a half years with five other Pentecostalists,
                        continue their hunger strike in hopes of gaining Soviet permission to
                        emigrate. The women commenced fasting on the 27th of December, taking only
                        liquids for sustenance. The Embassy reports that the women have lost some
                        weight, but are not yet in serious condition. The women appear determined to
                        maintain their fast until they and their families are permitted to leave the
                        Soviet Union—a solution they continue to believe the U.S. Government can
                        “force” the Soviet Union to grant them.</p>
                    <p>While we have no guarantee that your intervention will be responded to
                        favorably by the Soviets, the approach outlined in the draft message offers
                        the Soviets a face-saving way out of this tragic problem if they have any
                        interest in this at all. We, therefore, feel that this last attempt to work
                        through direct diplomatic channels is worth trying and should be done
                        now.</p>
                    <p>It will be essential that your message not be publicized.<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">An unknown hand underlined this sentence.</note> If the
                        Soviets do not take prompt steps to act on your proposal, however, we will

                        Pentecostalists—steps which are unlikely to bring positive action from the

                            BREZHNEV</hi>
                  </p>
                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I wish to direct your attention on an urgent basis to the plight of seven
                        Soviet Pentecostalists who have been living in our Embassy in Moscow since
                        seeking refuge there in June, 1978. These people seek permission from Soviet
                        authorities for themselves and their families to emigrate from the Soviet
                        Union according to the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on
                        Security and Cooperation in Europe. We have repeatedly approached the Soviet
                        Government on behalf of Petr and Augustina Vashchenko and their daughters,
                        Lidiya, Lyuba, and Liliya, and Maria Chmykhalov and her son, Timofey, and
                        the other members of these two families, seeking a prompt and humanitarian
                        solution to their plight. Yet three and a half years later, they still await
                        permission to emigrate.</p>
                    <p>The families’ situation has now taken on a new and potentially tragic aspect.
                        After three and a half years of waiting, in frustration and <pb n="416" facs="0447" xml:id="pg_416"/>now in despair, two of the family members,
                        Mrs. Augustina Vashenko and her daughter, Lidiya, have embarked upon a
                        hunger strike in support of their goals. Despite the efforts of the Embassy
                        staff and of the families’ other friends and sincere well-wishers in the
                        United States and in Europe to dissuade them from this life-endangering
                        course, the two women have made clear they are determined to continue their
                        fast.</p>
                    <p>Our Embassy in Moscow has discussed this matter with your Ministry of Foreign
                        Affairs, informing the Ministry that the two families have agreed to leave
                        the Embassy and return to their homes in Chernogorsk for the processing of
                        their applications for emigration, according to Soviet laws and procedures,
                        if their other family members residing in Chernogorsk are first permitted to
                        emigrate, and if the seven family members are guaranteed that they will not
                        be prosecuted by the authorities once they depart the U.S. Embassy and
                        assured that their applications for exit permission for reunification with
                        their other family members abroad will be granted. Out of deep concern for
                        their lives and health and for the plight of their family members, I ask you
                        to intervene personally in this matter to allow these people to emigrate and
                        thereby bring about a humanitarian solution before it is too late.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> Division Chief Komplektov with request

                        President <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>. <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> emphasized that the letter was couched in
                        humanitarian terms. That it contained no polemics of any sort, and that it
                        described a proposal which offered a way out of the problem. Komplektov said
                        he would do so and would not comment on the letter itself. But he did have
                        some remarks to make on the Pentecostal issue. Komplektov then, in a tone
                        which was insensitive even for him, said that the Pentecostals were entirely
                        a responsibility of the U.S. Embassy and the Soviet Government had no
                        responsibility in any way. He called the proposal offered in the President’s
                        letter—which the <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> had discussed with his
                        deputy the week before—“not a proposal, but a condition.” The <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> disagreed, saying that it had taken the
                        families several months to agree on such a plan and that it offered a good
                        possibility for solving the problem. Returning to the attack, Komplektov
                        said that the prior emigration of the family members was certainly a
                        pre-condition. He said that the Soviet position was clear and consistent:
                        the families should go back to Chernogorsk and apply for emigration
                        permission there. In closing he asked sarcastically what were our plans for
                        releasing the President’s letter. <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss>
                        assured him that the letter would not be released because we wanted to
                        provide the best possibility for resolving this case. Disbelieving,
                        Komplektov said “we will see whether the U.S. side leaks the letter.” In
                        closing, he reiterated that he was not commenting on the President’s letter
                        itself and that it would be transmitted to President <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>.</p>

                    <p>I had lunch today at the Soviet Embassy with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>. In the course of a wide ranging
                        conversation, we covered the following subjects of interest.</p>
                    <pb n="418" facs="0449" xml:id="pg_418"/>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> began by discussing plans for
                        the Secretary’s meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        in Geneva January 26–27. In this connection, I noted the possibility that
                        the Secretary might have to restrict his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> to one day, the 26th. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> was curious as to the reason for
                        this and I pointed to the Secretary’s plans to travel to the Middle East
                        following the session in Geneva. I stressed, however, that no final decision
                        had been made.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> was interested in reviewing
                        probable subjects which would come up at the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> meeting
                        and whether or not agreement could be reached on any of the topics. He
                        mentioned strategic arms talks as a leading topic. I said that the Secretary
                        probably would be prepared to discuss this in general terms against the
                        background of the President’s continuing interest in working for deep
                        reductions in strategic arms. However, I did not feel that, in present
                        circumstances, there was any prospect that we would be prepared to fix a
                        specific date for the beginning of formal negotiations of <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>. This was a matter best pursued
                        through diplomatic channels at present.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> anticipated that the
                        Secretary would wish to follow up the earlier talks with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> in New York on Poland, Cuba,
                        Afghanistan and Angola. He thought agreement on anything connected with
                        these subjects was unlikely, and I agreed. On Angola, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> seemed to indicate somewhat more
                        disposition to discuss the matter, as outlined below.</p>
                    <p>With regard to bilateral matters, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> thought there would be little to say at Geneva. He
                        felt that there was nothing much to take up on exchanges, since we had
                        placed most of them in suspense. Consulates also seemed dormant, although he
                        understood that it was our intention to keep a hold on our buildings in
                        Kiev.</p>
                    <p>I mentioned the situation of the Pentecostalists, saying that, as he knew,
                        this was of interest at the highest level in our government. The whole
                        situation was difficult and tragic—the best would be to permit family
                        members in Chernogorsk to leave for the United States, with the
                        Pentecostalists in the Embassy than being released to return to Chernogorsk
                        and then to join their relatives in the United States. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he knew that <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> had talked to the Pentecostalists in
                        Moscow (<persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> had also called
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>). <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said the only way to proceed was
                        for the Pentecostalists to leave the Embassy and return to their homes.
                        Thereafter, they could follow regular procedures and seek emigration.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> had the following comments to
                        make on the various subjects mentioned above as possible topics for the
                        discussions in Geneva.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">INF</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        said it was “curious” that the US side had not been better prepared for the
                        INF negotiations. He claimed that the Soviets <pb n="419" facs="0450" xml:id="pg_419"/>had presented a detailed statement of their position
                        but that the US to date had failed to do so. The Soviets were waiting for
                        the US to come forward with concrete positions but, he claimed, the latest
                        US suggestion was for a two months’ recess, after which <persName corresp="#p_NPH_1">Nitze</persName> had said we would be prepared to go
                        into detail. I countered <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> on
                        both of his allegations, saying that it should have been clear that the US
                        side had presented a full statement of its position and that the main
                        problem was that the Soviets did not find it acceptable. When <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> might wish to discuss the
                        negotiations with the Secretary, I indicated that the Secretary would be
                        prepared to talk about the negotiations in general terms but that it was
                        preferable for the detailed negotiations to be conducted by our respective
                        delegations.</p>
                    <p>On <hi rend="italic">
                     <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>
                  </hi>, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> seemed to take in stride my
                        indication that we would not be prepared to set a date for the beginning of
                        formal talks. He felt, in any case, that the subject matter was so
                        complicated that any agreement was a long time off—perhaps three or four
                        years. Since both sides appeared willing to observe the conditions of
                        existing agreements, he wondered if it might not be possible to come up with
                        an interim agreement which would simply state this fact. This, at least,
                        would be a positive step. I said that such a course could cause problems for
                        the US side with the Senate, which would feel that its prerogatives were
                        being undermined by this type of interim agreement.</p>
                    <p>We argued at some length about relative strengths in the strategic field,
                        with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> recalling fears in
                        previous administrations about a “bomber gap” and a “missile gap” and
                        claiming that our present concerns about a trend toward Soviet superiority
                        were misplaced. He said it was clear that the United States has more
                        warheads than the Soviets, that the fact we have no heavy missiles is not of
                        Soviet doing, etc. I made clear to him our basic concerns about the extent
                        of Soviet activities in the missile field and the determination of the
                        United States to correct the imbalance.</p>
                    <p>On <hi rend="italic">Afghanistan</hi>, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> acknowledged that some additional Soviet troops had
                        been introduced into that country. However, the Soviet Union was being
                        cautious and would not follow the US example in Vietnam in introducing great
                        numbers of troops. The main reason for this, he said, was to reduce
                        casualties. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said the
                        fighting in Afghanistan was being prolonged because we were supplying the
                        insurgents with weapons through Pakistan. This was causing great resentment
                        in the Soviet Union and he said that “some circles” felt that the Soviet
                        Union should “begin to get something out of the Afghan situation” by, for
                        example, constructing airfields in Afghanistan which could take long-range
                        military jet airplanes. This, he said, at least could “give us something to
                        trade” in response to US pressures. I warned him that this would be a very
                        dangerous game indeed.</p>
                    <pb n="420" facs="0451" xml:id="pg_420"/>
                    <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that we would be
                        interested in serious discussions with the Soviets on Afghanistan and would
                        be glad to hear an elucidation of their ideas. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> replied that the Soviets were still waiting for the
                        US to take up the subject in Moscow through our Embassy, as had been
                        promised by the Secretary in New York.</p>
                    <p>On <hi rend="italic">Angola</hi>, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> wondered if the Secretary would wish to pursue this
                        subject further with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. I said
                        I was sure the Secretary would wish to do so, following up on the talks in
                        New York. I described briefly our Namibian negotiations and pointed to the
                        necessity for Cuban troops to leave Angola simultaneously with the
                        withdrawal of South African troops from Namibia. When <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> questioned whether Cubans were
                        really endangering South African forces, I said that the Cuban presence was
                        part of the overall security picture in the area and that it would be
                        essential for them to be withdrawn if independence for Namibia is to be
                        achieved. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> did not appear to
                        contest this concept vigorously.</p>
                    <p>In discussing Cuba, I mentioned my representations to <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> about the latest delivery of
                        MIG–23’s to the island, saying that this action was of great concern to the
                        United States and that it appeared to be part of an overall Soviet thrust
                        through Cuba to expand its power base in the hemisphere. I called attention
                        to the restrained press treatment we have given to the MIG–23 story and said
                        that the Secretary would be discussing this with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> in Geneva. I repeated that the delivery of the MIGs
                        raised questions regarding the 1962 understandings which required
                            clarification.<note n="2" xml:id="d131fn2">Reference is to informal
                            agreements reached between <persName corresp="#p_KRT_1">Robert
                                Kennedy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Anatoly
                                Dobrynin</persName> during the Cuban missile crisis in October
                            1962.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> had always observed the 1962
                        understandings scrupulously. The MIG–23’s did not violate the understandings
                        and the Soviets could not understand our concerns on this score. He said he
                        had received nothing from Moscow regarding my demarche on the planes; it was
                        possible <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would have something
                        to say on the subject. I noted that the MIG’s could be said to constitute a
                        “grey area” which should be clarified.</p>
                    <p>On another aspect of the Cuban situation, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> recited at some length his conversations with the
                        Secretary about US charges earlier in 1981 that some 1,600 Cuban troops had
                        been sent to Nicaragua. He stated that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had taken these charges up directly with Castro and
                        that Castro had totally and convincingly rejected them as false. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> felt that the United States had
                        never proved its case on these charges and that this had left the Soviets
                        feeling that the US concerns should not be taken seriously.</p>
                    <pb n="421" facs="0452" xml:id="pg_421"/>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he knew that the
                        Secretary had met with the Cuban Vice President several months ago.<note n="3" xml:id="d131fn3">Reference is to a meeting between <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> and Cuban Vice President Carlos
                            Rafael Rodriguez in Mexico City on November 23, 1981.</note> He wondered
                        what results had come from that meeting and what the prospects were for
                        US-Cuban relations. I said that, whatever our contacts with Cuba might be,
                        they had produced nothing positive to date. We continued to feel that the
                        export of revolution by Cuba to Central America and other countries, the
                        build up of arms in Cuba and Cuban activities in Africa raised tensions and
                        should be terminated.</p>
                    <p>On <hi rend="italic">Poland</hi>, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> seemed particularly negative. Referring to our
                        “three demands”—lifting of martial law, freeing of prisoners and a
                        resumption of dialogue between the government, Church and
                            Solidarity—<persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that all
                        three posed unacceptable demands on the Polish authorities. To lift martial
                        law at this time and free the prisoners would only risk a return to the
                        chaos preceding the December 13 action. He defended at length the right of
                        the Polish government to act against those who wished to usurp power and
                        contested the idea that what had occured December 13 was in any sense
                        illegal or a “coup d’etat”. As to negotiations with Solidarity, this meant
                        placing Solidarity on the same level with the government, which was clearly
                        impossible. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> went on to say
                        that “Solidarity” has become a “bad word” in the Soviet Union and the
                        Eastern Bloc in general. While there could be a place for a vigorous trade
                        union looking after the interests of the workers, he doubted if it would be
                        called “Solidarity” in the future. As to whether it would have the right to
                        strike, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> was uncertain,
                        saying that “all sorts of things can happen in Poland”. He stated that, of
                        course, any future trade union would be barred from reaching for political
                        power.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> referred to sanctions only in
                        passing, saying that there did not seem to be anything left for us to do
                        against the Soviet Union in this area. I assured him that there were,
                        indeed, other measures which could be taken and that we might very well be
                        compelled to take such steps in light of the lack of progress regarding
                        Poland.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> was curious regarding our
                        plans for the Madrid <hi rend="italic">
                     <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> meeting</hi>. He asked if the Secretary planned to
                        attend and, if so, for how long. I confirmed that the Secretary intended to
                        be present for the opening session. I did not know how long he would be
                        staying, but I made clear that his focus, as well as that of other Western
                        Ministers present, would be on Poland.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> inquired about the
                        possibility for a summit meeting between the President and <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>. He said that he personally <pb n="422" facs="0453" xml:id="pg_422"/>thought it was unlikely that a
                        “traditional summit” could be held in ’82 with a full blown communique, etc.
                        Perhaps a “get acquainted” meeting would be more practical. I said that,
                        under present circumstances, I did not see the possibility of any kind of a
                        meeting at the summit. The President has stated several times his interest
                        in meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> and I felt
                        that this was something the President wanted to do but that Poland made that
                        impossible for the foreseeable future.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that he was extremely
                        discouraged about the prospects for any kind of agreement between the US and
                        the Soviet Union. In all of his experience, he had never seen such a bad
                        time in US-Soviet relations. He believes the US Administration is on a
                        deliberate confrontation course with the Soviet Union and that the future
                        looked extremely discouraging. I agreed that prospects did not look bright,
                        primarily because of Soviet actions. I contested <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s assertion that the Administration wished a
                        confrontation with the Soviet Union. What we hoped for was more moderation
                        and restraint on the Soviet side which would enable us both to get on a more
                        stable basis in our relationship. So long as such moderation and restraint
                        were absent, then the relationship would only suffer.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>We have remained flexible up to now on whether or not to proceed with the
                        meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> originally
                        scheduled for the two days of January 26–27. There have been powerful pros
                        and cons on both sides of the question. After considering them and taking
                        into account the encouragement to go ahead I have been getting from the Pope
                        and the Europeans, I believe on balance that I should go ahead with the
                        meeting, and use it to register our outrage at continuing repression in
                        Poland and the fact that we will not be conducting business as usual while
                        it goes on.</p>
                    <p>As a preliminary signal, I am reducing the duration of the meeting to one day
                        instead of two, and this will be clear when the two sides make their
                        announcement Thursday.<note n="2" xml:id="d132fn2">January 21.</note> At the
                        meeting itself, I will focus on Poland, Cuba and other egregious Soviet
                        breaches of decent behavior and international comity. (I will also follow up
                        on your letter to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> about the
                        Pentecostalist families in our Moscow Embassy.) My point will be that the
                        Soviet Union has been tearing down the whole structure of political
                        relationships built up since the War, thereby raising serious questions as
                        to the durability of that structure.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Mr. President,</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>With regard to your communication of January 15, 1982,<note n="2" xml:id="d133fn2">See the attachment to <ref target="#d129">Document
                                129</ref>.</note> I would like to say the following.</p>
                    <p>The people whom you are petitioning for have really found themselves in a
                        situation not to be envied. After all, this situation was created and has
                        long been maintained in an artificial manner. A way out of it could have
                        been found a long time ago. At the present time, too, it is possible to
                        resolve this question.</p>
                    <p>The only thing needed is that the US side rather than detain those people
                        within the walls of its Embassy, take measures for them to leave it. Nothing
                        stands in the way of such a step—nobody intended or intends to prosecute
                        that group of pentecostalists.</p>
                    <p>As to their departure from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, this
                        question can be considered in accordance with the procedure established
                        under our laws and equally applicable to all Soviet citizens, after those
                        persons return to the place of their residence.</p>
                    <p>However, the group of the sect members that happened to be in the US Embassy
                        is being pushed for some reason or another in a different direction—toward
                        violation of the Soviet laws, setting forth prior conditions and all sorts
                        of demands that can lead only to an impasse. Thus, the entire responsibility
                        for the existing situation rests with the US side, including the
                        responsibility of humanitarian nature.</p>
                    <p>We are not the ones to be called upon to exercise humaneness. For that
                        matter, the references to humaneness are not convincing, while, in fact,
                        attempts are being made to manipulate the destinies of individuals and not
                        only those of the sect members who are kept in the US Embassy.</p>
                    <p>What kind of humaneness can one invoke, when the children are forcefully
                        separated from their parents, as is the case with the Soviet citizens
                        Polovchaks? Indeed, when even an American court rules to return Vladimir
                        Polovchak—a minor—to his parents and the US execu<pb n="425" facs="0456" xml:id="pg_425"/>tive authorities are raising obstacles thereto, it is
                        not simply inhumane but immoral.</p>
                    <p>I would like to believe that on the part of the US side necessary measures
                        will be taken to discontinue the abnormal situation existing around the
                        group of Soviet citizens who find themselves in the US Embassy in
                        Moscow.</p>

                            scheduled for publication in <ref target="frus1981-88v41">
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1981–1988, vol. XLI,
                                Global Issues II</ref>.</note> and he noted that the Vice President
                        nearly fell out of his chair when the Secretary suggested “sealing the
                        Hemisphere” in relation to Cuba. The Secretary noted that if these people
                        want to get tough he will show them what being tough is all about. The
                        Secretary also noted in a joking manner that during his own presentation on
                        Cuba <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Meese</persName> was already busy
                        formulating his backgrounder.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> meeting, the
                        Secretary noted that the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s
                            analysis<note n="5" xml:id="d134fn5">Not further identified.</note> of
                        prospects for the meeting had made him feel bad; that perhaps we had been
                        too mean to the Soviets. The Secretary was obviously worried by the tone of
                        the analysis, and suggested that it was perhaps written by <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Jimmy Carter</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Rick Burt</persName> noted that the analysis was produced by <persName corresp="#p_CWJ_1">Casey</persName>’s best Soviet minds, [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>Referring to the section on Helsinki the Secretary felt certain that
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would turn the issue of
                        interventionism back on us, but that he was adequately prepared to defend
                        our position.</p>
                    <p>On <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>, the Secretary noted that he will
                        make some positive noises so that the Soviets cannot reap a propaganda
                        windfall by saying that we have abandoned arms control. The Secretary called
                        attention to his <hi rend="italic">US News</hi> interview, which he referred
                        to as being quite starchy. The group agreed that he had laid out a clear
                        rationale for the prospects on <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> and
                        INF.</p>
                    <p>Referring to a <hi rend="italic">Boston Globe</hi> article of today, the
                        Secretary asked who told Beecher that Henry<note n="6" xml:id="d134fn6">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry
                            Kissinger</persName>.</note> is advising us. The Secretary recalled a
                        recent conversation with Joe Kraft in which he told Kraft jokingly that the
                        reason we were going to continue with the Geneva meeting was because
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry</persName> suggested we should not.
                        The Secretary noted that we will be going to Geneva despite <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry</persName>’s admonitions, not because of
                        them.</p>
                    <pb n="427" facs="0458" xml:id="pg_427"/>
                    <p>Returning to Helsinki, the Secretary asked that relevant paragraphs from the
                        Final Act be included in his briefing materials so that if the need arises
                        he can quote.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then discussed the general approach to the meeting, in which he
                        wants to avoid dealing in rigidly ideological terms. Rather, he wants to
                        talk as a superpower should, referring to balances of power as opposed to
                        the suffering of the Polish people, for instance. He noted that in
                        particular page 5 of the talking points was a bit too ideological, but it
                        improved on page 6.</p>
                    <p>Turning to Cuba, <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> advised the
                        Secretary to mention Nicaragua very early on, perhaps in the first sentence,
                        noting the peculiar Soviet attachment to the order in which issues are
                        raised. It should be clear to the Soviets that Nicaragua is a high priority
                        item.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary, in reading through talking points on the Floggers, asked why
                        they were designated as MiG–23/27. <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> noted that we were simply not sure which planes they
                        were, but added that <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> had
                        told <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> they were 23’s. It was
                        agreed, however, to refer to them in the generic term Floggers.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked that references to the 1962 understanding on pages 8 and
                        9 be deleted. <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> felt that the
                        specter of abrogating the agreement as a result of Soviet actions should be
                        raised, but not as the central focus. <persName corresp="#p_CR_1">Combs</persName> agreed and felt that we should also raise the fact
                        that the Soviets had done this previously in 1978. With <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> in agreement, the Secretary noted
                        that we had lost our pants in 1978 and we did not want to remind the Soviets
                        how easily they had gotten off.</p>
                    <p>On page 9 regarding the shipment of MiGs to Nicaragua, <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> suggested and the Secretary concurred
                        that we add a sentence along the lines of: “If these deliveries proceed, we
                        will be forced to respond.” Also on page 9, the Secretary noted that the
                        last sentence (“It would be a great mistake to underestimate the depth of
                        our concern”) sounded very Chinese, in that we had heard the same thing from
                        the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> on the Taiwan issue.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary observed that the whole Latin American section of the paper was
                        very very tough, and all agreed. <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would come away from this section with a fat lip.
                        The Secretary noted that in this phase of the discussion he would be “moving
                        from the pragmatist to the ideologue.” <persName corresp="#p_BLP_1">Bremer</persName> suggested that remaining a pragmatist will have a
                        more profound effect upon <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>,
                        who will then know that we mean business.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary also requested that <gloss target="#t_memcon_1">memcons</gloss>
                        from the first <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> meetings be
                        included in his briefing materials, as well as a recent <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> summary on Soviet arms transfers to
                        Cuba.</p>
                    <p>Turning to Afghanistan on page 10, <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> suggested that we remind <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> early on that we are aware that they have recently
                        increased <pb n="428" facs="0459" xml:id="pg_428"/>their presence in
                        Afghanistan. Noting that the Soviets must be aware that we are supporting
                        the Afghan freedom fighters, the Secretary asked if he should make clear to
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that we have additional
                        options in this regard. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>
                        interjected that <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> had
                        mentioned our support for the freedom fighters to him, so clearly the
                        Soviets were aware. The Secretary said that he would like to hold this
                        threat open, and he referred to it as the “Berlin riposte.”</p>
                    <p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_MRC_1">McFarlane</persName> stuck his
                        head in and the Secretary teased him about new problems with the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> now that Bud has moved to the White House.
                        Bud noted sarcastically that there was “real support” for the Secretary’s
                        position on an upcoming exercise in the Gulf of Sidra. The Secretary
                        responded by telling Bud that he should have seen <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Cap</persName>’s reaction when the Secretary raised
                        the issue of sealing the Hemisphere. The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Cap</persName> jumped up and said: “Mr. President,
                        this is a very serious matter which you should consider at length.”</p>
                    <p>Returning to the discussion, the Secretary asked for <gloss target="#t_memcon_1">memcons</gloss> from <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s 1970 and 1971 discussions with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> on Soviet support for North
                        Vietnam. He would like a few of the key paragraphs so that we might throw
                        some of the Soviets’ own language back at them. The point of this exercise,
                        apart from its rhetorical value, was to show the Soviets that we think
                        historically and keep a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> memory. They stuck it
                        right in our eye back then and we should not miss an opportunity to return
                        the favor.</p>
                    <p>On the question of raising support for the Afghan freedom fighters, <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> advised that a raising of that threat
                        would probably lead the Soviets toward increased action against Pakistan and
                        the Secretary agreed. The Secretary observed that we need another trip over
                        there very soon to quiet the Paks and the Indians down. He noted that Zia is
                        becoming increasingly apprehensive, and said that someone should think about
                        sending <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Buckley</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName> to the region. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Tom Simons</persName>, who was not aware of the
                        Secretary’s heavy travel schedule, suggested that perhaps the Secretary
                        should do it. The Secretary responded unbelievingly “Are you talking to me?”
                        He noted that between now and June he would probably be in town for only one
                        week, and that every time he returns he finds Jerry sitting behind his
                        desk.</p>
                    <p>On Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> suggested that
                        the best way to hit the Soviets would be to tell them that we know exactly
                        what they’re doing. We are aware of their increased troop strength as well
                        as the fact that they are now teaching Russian to school children. It is
                        clear, said <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName>, that they are
                        attempting to absorb the country.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary interrupted to note that <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Mac
                            Baldrige</persName> was having some fun dabbling in foreign policy on
                        his trade mission to Africa. He noted that King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> gave Mac a letter which he had written to <pb n="429" facs="0460" xml:id="pg_429"/>the Algerians. The Secretary, who had
                        apparently just spoken with <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName>, told him to have his people prepare a memo, then to
                        let our experts look at it, and then the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName> could have a joint meeting with
                        the President to deliver the letter. The Secretary also noted that <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName> had played around with foreign
                        policy with the President of Senegal as well.</p>
                    <p>Turning to a discussion of Southern Africa (page 12), the Secretary said that
                        we would open by noting that the Soviet and Cuban presence in Angola had
                        been increased. <persName corresp="#p_PRMH_1">Palmer</persName> interjected
                        that in fact in every area raised with the Soviets since January of last
                        year the threats have gotten worse. The Secretary was very enamored with
                        this approach and suggested that we use it at the very beginning of his
                        discussions with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. He wanted
                        to open by saying to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that all
                        of our agenda items—Afghanistan, Southern Africa, Cuba, Central America, and
                        Poland—have deteriorated since the New York discussions. The Secretary said
                        that he would tell <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that he
                        was profoundly concerned with this trending, which will have a serious
                        impact upon our relations. In addition, the Secretary noted that the Soviets
                        had not done anything on human rights, with the exception of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName>’s daughter-in-law. <persName corresp="#p_BLP_1">Bremer</persName> interjected that Saturday<note n="7" xml:id="d134fn7">January 23.</note> would be a crunch point in
                        terms of the Pentecostals, because they have announced that starting on
                        Saturday they will no longer take even water. Returning to the overall
                        theme, the Secretary noted that the Soviets have moved against us in every
                        area of critical concern and that therefore the nature of this meeting with
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> has been profoundly
                        affected.</p>
                    <p>Turning to INF (page 14), the Secretary asked for a detailed review of
                        progress thus far. Where have we been, what has been the nature of the
                        discussions, and what proposals have emerged since the Christmas recess? The
                        Secretary asked for this review to be available to read on the flight to
                        Europe. The Secretary was pleased with the explicit points raised on
                        Poland.</p>
                    <p>On CBW, the Secretary was also pleased with the opening sentence that we have
                        confirmed the use of chemical weapons in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia. He
                        wanted added to that sentence that this casts a grim shadow on the prospect
                        for progress on other arms control issues. The Secretary also wanted to tell
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that this issue will take
                        on increasing significance and that we will continue to draw increasing
                        attention to it. The Secretary asked for a two-page summary of what we have
                        on them and said “I want to let the bastard know what we have so I can hand
                        it to him.”</p>
                    <pb n="430" facs="0461" xml:id="pg_430"/>
                    <p>Stepping back from the details for a moment, the Secretary chuckled that this
                        is “one big God damn round of joy, thinking back to the days of vodka and
                        handshakes with <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and now
                        he’s telling us to be tough.”</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> noted that he had recently
                        come from a meeting with Ted Mann and that he was certain that public
                        pressure would build rapidly for the Secretary to raise Jewish emigration
                        from the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName>
                        pointed out that a rather lengthy Congressional letter with a number of
                        signatures would be appearing in the next few days relating to the same
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>Finishing the talking points, the Secretary observed that the last sentence
                        of the paper was rather weak. He wanted the closing redone to include a
                        brief summary of our agenda items, a mention of our good will, and the
                        specific steps the Soviets could take to earn that good will, and then to
                        close by hammering home the point that the key areas which control our
                        overall relations are all getting worse. The Secretary did not want to say
                        that we are headed on a collision course, but he did pause for a moment and
                        say “It is getting eerie, very eerie.” <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> offered that it was perhaps time to fasten our seat
                        belts.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary wanted to make sure that we made abundantly clear to the
                        Soviets that there is room for progress in Poland, Southern Africa, and
                        Cuba.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then observed that from the Soviet perspective we probably have
                        not done very much either. <persName corresp="#p_PRMH_1">Palmer</persName>
                        suggested that we take the approach of playing up the President’s November
                        18 speech,<note n="8" xml:id="d134fn8">See <ref target="#d137fn3">Document
                                137, footnote 3</ref>.</note> that we have offered them a 4-point
                        program for arms control discussions and attempted to open up a whole new
                        dialogue, and that what we got in return was Poland. The Secretary agreed
                        with this approach and asked that it be incorporated. The Secretary
                        commented that our “bitch list” is about overwhelming and “it makes me
                        wonder if we are spending enough for defense.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary also asked that in appropriate places in his papers efforts be
                        made to personalize some of the issues. For instance he wanted to say that
                        he himself had participated in the start of the Helsinki process under
                        Nixon. He also asked that his past experiences in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> as well as recent <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        meetings be referred to in understandable terms.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then discussed some of the carrots that should be offered. In
                        Southern Africa he would tell <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        that we have a breakthrough imminent which could occur any day with
                        absolutely no cost to the Soviets. He added that we should raise the
                        possibility <pb n="431" facs="0462" xml:id="pg_431"/>of normalizing
                        relations with Cuba in exchange for responsible behavior. He said that we
                        should send <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> home with some
                        carrots and not with a “plate full of shit.” However, the Secretary did not
                        want the carrots to overshadow the possibility that the whole of post-war
                        East-West relations was now hanging in the balance. We should raise the
                        specter of Yalta and Potsdam to show how seriously we view Soviet
                        irresponsibility, and to make them aware that continuation of present
                        threats will lead to a dismantling of all that has existed between East and
                        West. The Secretary noted that in our preparation we must be aware that this
                        is not merely a dialogue between <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>,
                        but it is a record which will be read by all Kremlin leaders now and in the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>In summary, the Secretary wanted to close with reference to our historic
                        relations; with a clear elucidation of the carrots and everything that is up
                        for grabs if they take responsible steps; our obligations as superpowers;
                        and a minimum of ideological negativism. The Secretary also asked that
                        something emotional be put in along the lines of “our children’s children.”
                        He noted that this would have an effect on <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>, who is “an emotional old guy—the type who would
                        cry after he threw you over the side.”</p>

                    <p>1. (S—Entire text)</p>
                    <pb n="432" facs="0463" xml:id="pg_432"/>
                    <p>2. Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> called
                        on Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> at his
                        request at 1630 local January 20 to deliver a non-paper containing the
                        Soviet reply to our January 10 demarche on Cuba.<note n="2" xml:id="d135fn2">See <ref target="#d128">Document 128</ref>.</note>
                        <gloss target="#t_EURSOV_1">EUR/SOV</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> also participated. Unofficial
                        Embassy translation of Russian text is at last para of this message.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he was delivering the
                        paper on behalf of his government, and he thought it a clear reply.</p>
                    <p>4. After reading over text, <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>
                        said he was not in a position to make a considered reply, but he could say
                        that our concerns remain. One problem is that these systems can be converted
                        quickly for nuclear delivery. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> commented that this is also true of MiG–21s; these
                        are MiG–23s.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> continued that we are
                        concerned with the whole Cuban arms buildup, the shipment of arms into Cuba,
                        and Cuban capacity to project power. This is natural: Cuba is very close to
                        the United States. But it also affects Central America. We cannot agree with
                        what is said in the Soviet paper on Nicaragua and other parts of the area.
                        We feel the thrust of the Cuban effort not only in Nicaragua but also in El
                        Salvador is clear. He was sure the Secretary would discuss it with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said the Cubans also have
                        great concerns, which they pass on to the Soviets. Belligerent U.S.
                        statements are a major factor. They ask what you intend to do, and cannot
                        but feel concerned. Current developments do not start from zero. That is why
                        they ask the Soviets for defensive weapons. They are getting more than
                        before, but that is because there is more concern.</p>
                    <p>7. On the understanding, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> drew
                        attention to the language of the Soviet paper affirming that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is fulfilling it and does not wish to
                        violate it as long as the U.S. does not.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> replied that we continue
                        to feel recent developments raise questions about the understanding,
                        concluding he would leave it at that. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether the Secretary would be in a position
                        to say something about the issue. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> said he did not know. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he had mentioned the possibility to Moscow,
                        and there are only a few days left.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> said we consider this a
                        serious matter, and do not plan a propaganda campaign. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said this was a welcome sign. We
                        are not stirring it, <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>
                        continued; it is the Cubans who are stirring things up.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> noted that the Soviet
                        paper referred to MiG–23s, and asked if the Soviets made the distinction
                        between MiG–23s and MiG–<pb n="433" facs="0464" xml:id="pg_433"/>27s, and
                        whether the paper therefore meant what it said. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said it meant exactly what it said: the Soviets
                        make the distinction, and what is involved is the same plane, but in the
                        MiG–23 modification.</p>
                    <p>11. Noting he had read a Gwertzmann <gloss target="#t_NYT_1">NYT</gloss>
                            article<note n="3" xml:id="d135fn3">Reference is presumably to
                            Gwertzman’s article of January 7, in which he wrote: “Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> has planned to meet with Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Andrei A. Gromyko</persName> of the
                            Soviet Union in Geneva on Jan. 27 to set the time and place for the

                            A1)</note> suggesting that a date for <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> could be announced after the Geneva meeting, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether the Secretary would
                        be prepared for this. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>
                        replied that this is not likely under present circumstances; we would wish
                        to continue in diplomatic channels. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said this was fair enough.</p>
                    <p>12. After a brief exchange on the announcement of the Geneva meeting due
                        January 21, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked about a
                        post-meeting statement. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>
                        replied that this would be up to the principals; any statement would
                        probably be very general, he anticipated.</p>
                    <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would be meeting with the Swiss
                        Foreign Minister in Geneva, but would not be lunching with him. Mrs. Gromyko
                        would accompany him to Geneva.</p>
                    <p>14. On the way in, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> told
                            <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> his information from
                        Moscow mentioned only <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> and
                        himself as accompanying <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> for
                        the talks, though he naturally assumed Sukhodrev would be there as
                        interpreter.</p>
                    <p>15. Text of Soviet Embassy translation of non-paper follows. Begin text:</p>
                    <p>—We cannot but find it strange that the US side is raising such questions
                        that entirely belong to the area of mutual relations between two sovereign
                        states—the Soviet Union and Cuba—and cannot be subject of discussion with
                        anyone else.</p>
                    <p>—Nor is there any foundation whatsoever, in this case, for making reference
                        to the known Soviet-American understanding of 1962. The Soviet Union has
                        done and is doing nothing of the kind in Cuba that would contradict the 1962
                        understanding. It fully adheres to its part of the understanding and intends
                        to continue doing so, having in mind that the US side, as has been confirmed
                        by it, will be strictly implementing its part of that understanding.</p>
                    <p>—Solely as an expression of good will, we can inform the US side that in the
                        framework of ordinary and planned arms deliveries for the Cuban defense
                        requirements a certain quantity of aircraft of the “MiG–23” type is being
                        sent there. The US side, undoubtedly, knows that the <pb n="434" facs="0465" xml:id="pg_434"/>aircraft of this type have been in Cuba for a fairly
                        long time. None of the modifications of this plane being delivered to Cuba
                        has the capability for use as a nuclear weapons carrier.</p>
                    <p>—Thus, the presence of the said aircraft in Cuba introduces no change in the
                        existing situation and has nothing to do with the Soviet-American
                        understanding of 1962.</p>
                    <p>—Therefore, the US side has no grounds for expressing any concern in this
                        regard, let alone, for viewing this question as allegedly affecting the
                        security interests of the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>. It is
                        clearly artificial to pose this question in such a way. And, of course, no
                        useful purpose can be served by a propaganda drive if it were launched now
                        around this question in the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—At the same time one cannot fail to see that the very attempt by the US side
                        to somehow cast doubt upon the legitimate cooperation between the Soviet
                        Union and Cuba, as well as the desire to involve in this case Nicaragua, do
                        nothing but further exacerbate the situation in the Carribean region and
                        step up tensions around Cuba and Nicaragua. On more than one occasion we
                        have brought this point to the attention of the US Government.</p>
                    <p>—If one is to speak of the concern over what is going on in that region, it
                        is precisely Cuba and Nicaragua who have more than ample grounds to have
                        such a concern. It is exactly they who are being threatened by the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> with a direct use of force, it is against
                        them that military demonstrations, manoeuvres, troop landings, and so on are
                        being staged. The training of mercenary bands and incursion groups takes
                        place on the territory of the United States. All this causes the peoples of
                        these countries to feel genuinely alarmed and naturally desirous to
                        strengthen their defense capacities.</p>
                    <p>—For that matter, the general policy of the United States in international
                        affairs in no way makes people feel less threatened as far as their fate is
                        concerned. Urging restraint, the United States does not itself exercise
                        restraint in dispatching huge quantities of most advanced weapons to dozens
                        of countries in the world, including to those areas where it can cause a
                        legitimate concern on the part of the Soviet Union. How are we supposed to
                        regard, for instance, the American-Israeli agreement on “strategic
                        cooperation” which is clearly directed not only against the Arabs but also
                        against the Soviet Union?</p>
                    <p>—Hence, as to the real causes of the existing tension in Soviet-American
                        relations, the responsibility for that tension rests entirely with the
                        United States. It would serve the interests of all peoples, including the
                        American people, to take measures to ameliorate the situation and not to
                        exacerbate it through raising non-existing questions and making propaganda
                        around them. End text.</p>

                    <p>I have heard that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> is
                        going to focus on Afghanistan in his January 26 meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. If so, I hope that he does not
                        repeat the proposal made to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        during their September 28, 1981 meeting:<note n="2" xml:id="d136fn2">See

                    <p>—The Afghanistan Government should take steps to broaden its base. (S)</p>
                    <p>—Second, the Soviet Union could simultaneously study a formula for a phased
                        withdrawal. (S)</p>
                    <p>—Third, outside powers could take a number of steps, including those
                        mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> last time
                        (September 23, 1981) regarding cross-border activities from outside the
                        borders of Afghanistan.<note n="3" xml:id="d136fn3">See <ref target="#d88">Document 88</ref>.</note> (S)</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_PR_2">Dick Pipes</persName> and I were nonplussed by
                        this proposal which had not been subjected to interagency discussion and
                        which, we believe, is replete with pitfalls. The Afghanistan Government
                        could “broaden its base” in a cosmetic fashion as Communist governments have
                        frequently done. The Soviets could go along with supporting in principle a
                        phased withdrawal. They have already stated they were prepared to withdraw
                        their forces from Afghanistan. In 1968, the Soviets said they would withdraw
                        their forces from Czechoslovakia, but they are still there. Worst of all,
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s last point suggests we
                        would be agreeable to closing Afghanistan’s borders and cutting off
                        assistance to the Afghan freedom fighters. (S)</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s proposal reflects
                        what I consider to be a common fallacy: the Soviets can be negotiated out of
                        Afghanistan. I am personally convinced that the Soviets are prepared to stay
                        the course until Afghanistan can be turned into another “Mongolian Peoples
                        Republic,” in effect an integral part of the Soviet Union. I see the Soviet
                        move into Afghanistan as a continuation of historic Russian expansion in
                        Central Asia which was going on until the end of the last century and <pb n="436" facs="0467" xml:id="pg_436"/>which was unsuccessfully attempted,
                        in the case of Iran, in this century. The “Great Game” referred to by
                        Kipling was the 19th century British effort to thwart Russian designs on
                        Afghanistan. (S)</p>
                    <p>The Soviets are prepared to wage long, protracted war in Afghanistan at a
                        relatively low level, and despite their current setbacks, I am afraid they
                        will win in the end. The world’s strongest land power is not going to allow
                        itself to be defeated or driven out by a ragtag collection of very
                        courageous, but poorly armed and poorly organized, Afghan irregulars.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>The Russians are not as impatient as are we in the West, and historically
                        they are used to long “pacification” campaigns in this area. It took the
                        Russians thirty years (1830–1860) to pacify the rebellious people of the
                        Caucasus. After the 1917 Russian Revolution, it took the Red Army nearly 15
                        years to subdue the Basmachis in Soviet Central Asia. It is significant that
                        a Soviet diplomat in Kabul recently compared the war in Afghanistan with the
                        campaign against the Basmachis. (S)</p>
                    <p>We should maintain constant pressure on the Soviets over Afghanistan and
                        never cease in keeping this issue alive in the form of world opinion, but we
                        should not harbor any illusions that we are going to succeed in getting the
                        Soviets out of Afghanistan through pressure, negotiations or both. For this
                        reason I consider it ill-advised for us to propose a solution which embraces
                        the concessions offered by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> last September 28. Such concessions can only encourage
                        the Soviets to believe that we are losing our resolve in opposing this
                        blatant act of aggression, and this can encourage further acts of
                        aggression. (S)</p>

                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> suggested he
                        and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> briefly discuss
                        the best way to proceed at today’s meeting.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that since <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        was our guest now, he would offer him the floor for any questions he might
                        care to raise. We had a full agenda, i.e., many topics to discuss.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> thanked the Secretary and said
                        that if the Secretary had been his guest he would have acted in the same
                        manner, giving him the floor.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Procedure for this Meeting</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> thought it best to say a few
                        words regarding procedure. The agenda for this meeting was not fixed;
                        therefore each of them could raise any question they believed worthwhile
                        holding an exchange of views on. Naturally, these questions should be of the
                        kind that both sides would want to discuss, for if there were some issues
                        that one side wanted to talk about while the other did not, the side that
                        wanted to discuss them could hardly do so with itself. But there would be no
                        lack of questions to choose from.</p>
                    <p>In speaking for the Soviet side, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would want to start with discussion of our bilateral
                        relations, i.e., relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.
                        Of course, it was just one subject, but what a subject! Later in the meeting
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would want to exchange
                        views with the Secretary on the subject of nuclear weapons in Europe;
                        negotiations on this matter had already started between the two Delegations
                        here in Geneva. In fact, this was also what he and the Secretary had agreed
                        upon when they last met in New York, i.e., that at the next meeting this
                        would be a subject of discussion.<note n="2" xml:id="d137fn2">See <ref target="#d90">Documents 90</ref> and <ref target="#d91">91</ref>.</note> Thus, we had a second topic here. Further, in the
                        Soviet view it would also be useful to <pb n="438" facs="0469" xml:id="pg_438"/>exchange views on strategic arms limitation. When they
                        last met in New York, they had touched on this very briefly. Of course, he
                        did not know to what extent the Secretary was prepared to take up this
                        question, but in principle he did have something to say in that connection;
                        so that could be the third topic for discussion. If the Secretary was
                        willing, of course. Then, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        would want to address a subject that <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had raised with him when they last met in New York:
                        Angola, Cuba and Namibia, in short a southern African Triad where <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had seen a linkage. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was prepared to express some views
                        on this topic from the standpoint of the Soviet Union. He thought it would
                        probably also be useful to touch on some questions relating to Asia as a
                        whole or to some regions in Asia. That might depend on how their discussions
                        proceeded. It would probably be equally correct to touch on matters related
                        to the situation in the Middle East. The US had displayed an interest in
                        that area, and this was known to the Soviet Union, and the US was also
                        getting involved in some of the events there. The Soviet Union, too, had an
                        interest in the situation in the Middle East and the Secretary would realize
                        why. After all, this region was close to the borders of the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps it would also be useful to talk about one other matter: the US and
                        the Soviet Union had been involved in discussions of very important
                        questions in the field of armaments and disarmament. With regard to some of
                        these aspects, contacts were continuing or had been resumed, but these were
                        very few in number. With respect to some other aspects, matters had come to
                        a standstill. As a practical matter, contacts had ended or had been
                        suspended. Should the Soviet side come to the conclusion that this was a
                        normal state of affairs, that a dialogue on these matters or broader
                        discussions, be they multilateral or bilateral, did not merit the attention
                        of the two sides? That was one more topic for discussion.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> thought the Secretary would
                        see that all of these problems could be discussed in the interest of
                        progress, provided both sides viewed these matters seriously. He would not
                        suggest that the two of them remain here in Geneva until Easter. The
                        situation was such that their meeting had been abbreviated down to only one
                        day of discussions; therefore they would have to properly assess how best to
                        use the time at their disposal. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> pointed out that the issues he would like to discuss
                        with the Secretary by no means exhausted the list of issues between us. He
                        also wondered whether they should continue their discussions in the
                        composition <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had outlined, and
                        as they had done in New York, or did the Secretary want to suggest another
                        approach? If the Secretary preferred the present composition, he would be
                        prepared to proceed and set forth Soviet views on the issues he had
                        identified. It would be useful if the Secretary were to <pb n="439" facs="0470" xml:id="pg_439"/>respond to each of these issues as it was
                        raised, rather than wait for complete statements on all of the issues at one
                        time. In this way they would cover their ground in sequence until they ran
                        aground on the time barrier to further discussion.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had reviewed a number of topics for
                        discussion and said that he was very comfortable with that review. He
                        thought he would prefer to retain the composition as it was now and go
                        through the basic topics. His approach was to update all the subjects they
                        had discussed in September. At that time, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had felt it most important to focus on the
                        international scene and the overall relations between our two countries. He
                        thought he would touch on each subject, updating its status on the basis of
                        events since September so as to have a clear picture of where they
                        stood.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S.-Soviet Relations</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> agreed and said he would start
                        off on US-Soviet relations. Unfortunately, it was his assessment that during
                        the few months since their meeting in New York bilateral relations between
                        our two countries had not improved at all. On the contrary, one might say
                        that they had become even more difficult.</p>
                    <p>As far as questions of nuclear weapons were concerned, the United States and
                        the Soviet Union to date had not only been unable to find common language,
                        but had also been unable to find any common ground. In his view, this had an
                        adverse effect on the relations between our two countries. Indeed, quite a
                        few statements had been made in the United States on this subject, at the
                        Presidential level, at Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s level and at other levels. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> regarded these statements as having
                        been made for the purpose of ensuring by hook or by crook that the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> decision to deploy new types of nuclear
                        weapons in Europe be implemented. Everything had been subordinated to that.
                        Later in this meeting <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would
                        address this matter in greater detail and put forward Soviet considerations
                        in that regard; for now he would only say that he considered the US position
                        on this matter as a position aimed at ensuring implementation of the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> decision.</p>
                    <p>This issue was somewhat like a large weight that pulled Soviet-US relations
                        downward. That such an assessment is justified is buttressed by the fact
                        that Washington has been consistently rejecting everything put forward by
                        the Soviet side in order to make it easier to find a compromise solution on
                        the basis of not infringing upon either US or Soviet security. Washington
                        has even rejected efforts aimed at finding some common ground that would not
                        violate the principle of equal security. No matter what had been put forward
                        by the Soviet side, it had all been rejected without any attempt being made
                        to discuss Soviet proposals.</p>
                    <pb n="440" facs="0471" xml:id="pg_440"/>
                    <p>The second situation that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        wanted to emphasize was the following: the Secretary would recall that in
                        New York they had talked about the possibility of resuming or extending some
                        agreements that were about to run out or that had already run out. They had
                        talked about ways of how and when to do so in the near future. But then the
                        US Administration had decided that all this must be discarded, that the
                        agreements that had expired be ended <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> or
                        paralyzed <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>. This, of course, reinforced the
                        unsatisfactory nature of the present Soviet-US relations and was a negative
                        factor that influenced other US-Soviet issues as well.</p>
                    <p>A third consideration <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted
                        to put forward—and he would repeat that this was not a completed inventory
                        of everything that could be talked about—was the following: literally, not a
                        single day passed that statements did not appear in Washington which struck
                        heavy blows at US-Soviet relations. Such statements were being made at all
                        sorts of levels—at the highest level, at the level of Ministers and
                        others—in fact at so many levels that it was difficult even to count them.
                        The Secretary might know better at how many levels such statements were
                        being rolled out. It was almost as if efforts were made to compete and see
                        who could make the most negative statement. All this seriously poisoned
                        Soviet-US relations, and very badly at that. All this resulted in
                        demolishing everything that had been achieved by the Soviet Union and by
                        several US Administrations, working together over a period of at least a
                        decade. In fact, the Secretary had taken part in some of those efforts and
                        had witnessed them being made.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that he had the
                        impression that some of the present leading figures in the United States
                        were rubbing their hands in delight at every new blow that was struck at
                        US-Soviet relations. However, one should recall how much effort and work had
                        gone into building up and improving these relations on a step-by-step basis,
                        in order to ensure that each side respected the reasonable and legitimate
                        interests of the other. Today all this was being burned, and those in
                        Washington who have a hand in this demolition of relations between us
                        express great satisfaction as these relations become worse.</p>
                    <p>This is indeed a very strange situation. Some special names have been
                        invented to designate certain actions, sometimes these are called sanctions
                        and sometimes something else, but <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> believed that what was important was not the names
                        given to these actions, but that their combined effect was to lead to
                        destruction of the results of the labor expended over decades by so many
                        people. He could use stronger words to describe today’s situation, but did
                        not want to exacerbate things further. He still hoped that sooner or later
                        Washington would understand that these steps, i.e., sanctions and others,
                        would not yield the results that those taking them expected. They would
                        surely not yield such results.</p>
                    <pb n="441" facs="0472" xml:id="pg_441"/>
                    <p>Affairs between two major powers should be conducted only on the basis of due
                        regard for each other’s legitimate interests, seeking accommodation and, of
                        course, showing respect for each other. Any other way of proceeding could
                        only produce negative results. For his part, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would venture to say that he was not inclined to
                        believe that the American people eagerly awaited increases in tensions to a
                        point where such inflammation might escalate to a clash. He did not believe
                        it because he was firmly convinced that people instinctively realized that
                        the Soviet Union and the United States were in the same boat, especially in
                        this nuclear age. Thus, he and the Soviet authorities were inclined to
                        believe that regardless of the emotions some people vented from time to
                        time, Washington, i.e., those officials in the US who had their hands on the
                        helm of US foreign policy, would ultimately also realize that we were in the
                        same boat.</p>
                    <p>He recalled that when they had last met in New York, they had discussed a
                        closely related subject. In the course of the discussion the Secretary had
                        expressed displeasure about certain statements in the Soviet Union, i.e.,
                        statements in the Soviet press that were aimed directly at leading figures
                        in the United States. He had to tell the Secretary once again that what the
                        Soviet side did in this respect, it did by way of reacting to similar
                        statements in the United States and, in fact, by way of reacting to a much
                        lesser extent than would be justified. The Soviet Union lagged far behind
                        the United States in this respect. In the US, such statements in the press
                        appeared constantly, but what especially disturbed the Soviet authorities
                        were the official statements made by leading American officials. The fact
                        that sometimes no specific names were mentioned did not change anything at
                        all. It is absolutely clear in any event who is meant by such
                        statements.</p>
                    <p>Yet, it would not be difficult to change direction. He believed that the
                        Secretary knew best where things were going in that regard. But he should
                        also know that if the US continued to act in this manner with respect to
                        Soviet authorities, the Soviet Union would have no alternative but to react
                        in kind. This referred to hostile statements directed against the Soviet
                        social system and the Soviet leadership. Why not try an experiment? Try to
                        stop such attacks if only for one month; then the Secretary would see how
                        the Soviet Union would respond.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that he wanted to
                        conclude this portion of his comments by saying that, of course, his
                        authorities wanted to see our relations normalized. This did not mean that
                        the two sides would be able immediately to eliminate all differences on many
                        issues, international as well as bilateral. But it did mean that such
                        differences could be discussed in the spirit of seeking and ultimately
                        finding points of contact. If the US refrained from hostile statements aimed
                        at Soviet <pb n="442" facs="0473" xml:id="pg_442"/>authorities and their
                        social system, the Soviet Union would certainly display its readiness and
                        willingness to even out the atmosphere surrounding our mutual relations, and
                        that would apply to all areas, whether this be nuclear weapons or regional
                        complications.</p>
                    <p>In all other matters the US would find the Soviet Union a partner who would
                        make every effort to find common language and to contribute to improvement
                        in our mutual relations. It would be even better to establish friendly
                        relations between us, as pointed out by <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> on a number of occasions. This, of course, required
                        the desire on both sides to establish such friendly relations. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> concluded his remarks on the
                        general state of relations between our two countries and said he was
                        prepared to hear the Secretary’s response.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> said he appreciated
                        the considerations <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had put
                        forward and by way of a tour d’horizon wanted to make some general
                        observations. First he would assure <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that he had left their discussion in New York with a
                        cautious sense of optimism that the months ahead would give us the
                        opportunityy of straightening out a number of long-simmering tensions. He
                        had returned to Washington and had given President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> his assessment to that effect. The
                        President shared with the Secretary the hope and intent that we could put
                        our relations on a more even course. It was largely in response to that
                        assessment that President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> had
                        presented his four-point arms control approach in November.<note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3">See “Remarks to Members of the National Press Club on
                            Arms Reduction and Nuclear Weapons,” November 18, 1981, <hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                     </hi>, 1981, pp. 1062–1067.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>However, the Secretary had to tell <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that in the process of preparing for this
                        evening-out effort, we had maintained a careful watch—hour by hour and day
                        by day—on the subject he and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        had discussed in New York. He believed it important, in the light of
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s comments, that he
                        hastily touch on the conclusions we had drawn from that careful watch.</p>
                    <p>First, in New York, when he and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had discussed regional problems, the Secretary had
                        made plain our desire to help settle the Afghanistan problem. Somewhat
                        later, through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> in
                        Moscow, we had talked about our three element approach to resolving this
                        problem. That approach consisted of a provision for self-determination,
                        guaranteed borders—a question that had been raised by <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>—and a provision for time-phased
                        withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan. Instead, we saw increasing
                        troop levels and increased pressure on the Government of Pakistan, with
                        which we have historically maintained friendly relations.</p>
                    <pb n="443" facs="0474" xml:id="pg_443"/>
                    <p>A second area he and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had
                        discussed was the situation in Southern Africa, an area in finding a formula
                        for the achievement of an independent Namibia that would be disassociated
                        from the rivalries of the major powers. What we had witnessed instead were
                        increasing levels of Cuban force in Angola and strong pressures on the
                        Government of Angola to reject all efforts at achieving a solution. The main
                        thrust of Soviet policy in that area, as we assessed and confirmed by local
                        contacts, was precisely the opposite.</p>
                    <p>He and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> also had discussed
                        issues affecting Central America, in particular Cuban arms and Cuban
                        interventionism. At that time <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        had described the Soviet arms there as modest and defensive in nature. In
                        the last few weeks we had seen arms shipments to Cuba increased to such an
                        extent that the total of arms delivered in 1981 amounted to three times, the
                        Secretary wished to emphasize, three times the amount provided to Cuba
                        during 1980. Perhaps what was most important was the character of these
                        arms, i.e., naval, air and ground equipment. We had carefully assessed the
                        exchanges that had taken place between the <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> Administration and the Soviet Union at the time that
                        MiG–23s were first introduced to Cuba. The question about the character of
                        these aircraft had been raised in terms of their capability to deliver
                        nuclear weapons. Our records confirm that U.S. officials involved at that
                        time had made clear that while the United States would accept the assurances
                        of the Soviet Union in that regard, (assurances which were not verifiable),
                        the U.S. also made clear that no additional numbers of these aircraft should
                        be introduced into the area. We now are faced with additional numbers of
                        aircraft, a higher quality air defense—SAM–6 air defense missiles,
                        sophisticated radars, naval patrol craft and helicopters in overall
                        quantities that cannot but give rise to serious doubts in Washington
                        concerning Soviet intentions.</p>
                    <p>The situation is further complicated by our day-to-day assessment of the
                        situation with regard to Nicaragua, and the fact that the Soviet Union had
                        given clear license to Cuba not only to increase its interference in that
                        country, but particularly to upgrade Nicaragua’s military forces. In that
                        connection, the Secretary had received assurances from the Foreign Minister
                        of Nicaragua at Sta. Lucia that Nicaragua would not receive MiGs from Cuba
                        or from Eastern Europe. We now saw airfields being built and Soviet advisors
                        acting in a training role with Nicaraguan pilots. We believe it essential
                        that the assurances we received regarding aircraft to Nicaragua at the Sta.
                        Lucia meeting be lived up to. We consider the introduction of such aircraft
                        unacceptable.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then turned to other questions he and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had discussed last September,
                        especially those concerning nuclear arms. We had entered the Geneva
                        negotiations in good faith with a view to achieving reductions in nuclear
                        arms and with a special formula to <pb n="444" facs="0475" xml:id="pg_444"/>remove the greatest irritant to US-Soviet relations, namely the Soviet
                        SS–20 missiles which threatened our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        allies. We remain at the negotiations in good faith, while continuing with
                        the deployment plans of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> to which
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had referred. The
                        Secretary had to say that the initial exchanges had clearly indicated that
                        the principal difficulties encountered at the negotiations concerned
                        reaching a consensus view regarding the data base. It was our judgment at
                        this time that the principle of equality and equal security, which had been
                        put forward by the Soviet side, cannot be implemented in a situation in
                        which the Soviet side views elimination of all threats from all sources as
                        an immediate objective of the negotiations. This was a clear instance of
                        Soviet striving to maintain superiority.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary turned to the area of bilateral relations which he and
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had discussed last
                        September. In this area, too, day-to-day responses by the Soviet side had
                        been disappointing and alarming. We had raised a number of human rights
                        cases which could have been resolved, with good will and creative
                        suggestions or solutions. We had specifically mentioned the cases of
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shcharanskiy</persName> and Skuodis, as well
                        as the Pentecostalists still in the US Embassy in Moscow, where a serious
                        situation exists as these individuals became involved in a hunger strike and
                        their health is in question.<note n="4" xml:id="d137fn4">See <ref target="#d90">Document 90</ref>.</note> We have conceived an
                        innovative formula to resolve these cases and have proposed it to the Soviet
                        Union, but once again without success.<note n="5" xml:id="d137fn5">See <ref target="#d129">Document 129</ref>.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>The Secretary said there had been increasing evidence, and we had an
                        up-to-date fact sheet in that respect, of violations of international law
                        with respect to the use of toxic and chemical weapons in Southeast Asia and
                        Afghanistan respectively. The evidence we had was conclusive and
                        overwhelming, and the Soviet role in the use of these weapons was
                        incontrovertible. This could only put a serious dent in the whole
                        credibility of solutions in arms control areas.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that last September we had also expressed our great
                        concern over the crisis in Poland. Since then events have occurred which as
                        a practical consequence raise doubts among the American people about the
                        future relations between us and the Soviet Union. These doubts are fully
                        shared by our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies. By every
                        assessment we have made, the prospects have increased for violence in
                        Poland, which was something we had hoped to avoid. We have been and are
                        ready today in this regard to join with the Soviet Union in a formula to
                        increase the level of moderation and to rebuild in Poland with whatever
                        resources necessary to ensure the viability of the Polish state. <pb n="445" facs="0476" xml:id="pg_445"/>We clearly understand the importance of
                        this issue to the Soviet Union, but we also understand that the whole
                        framework of our relations is at stake.</p>
                    <p>In fact, we are at a turning point which, in terms of East-West relations, is
                        the most significant since World War II. Like the Soviet Union, we have no
                        wish to see the situation deteriorate. Like the Soviet Union, we feel that
                        the Helsinki Agreements represent a historic opportunity to continue and to
                        improve our post World War II efforts at bettering our relations. However,
                        speaking frankly, the Secretary would point out that as we assessed each
                        issue, instead of receiving responses from the Soviet side that would be
                        encouraging, we find acts on the Soviet side which complicate and test our
                        assessment of Soviet intentions for future relations between us.</p>
                    <p>He could assure <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> personally shares
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s view regarding the
                        need for our two countries to work together. But the Secretary had to say
                        that on no single issue had we received any evidence that the Soviet side
                        was prepared to deal with these issues in a spirit of reciprocity. The
                        Secretary did not expect <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> to
                        share the assessment he had just given, but he would ask <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> to consider the possibility of
                        carefully developing measurable manifestations of his Government’s actions
                        in each area they had discussed in September. The Secretary concluded by
                        saying that this was the broad tour d’horizon of the problems facing us to
                        which he wanted to draw <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                        attention. He would suggest that we must do everything possible to find ways
                        of reversing this trend in the relations between us before it cannot be
                        reversed. He was prepared to listen to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s assessment.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> noted that in presenting his
                        considerations the Secretary had gone beyond the strict limits of the
                        general subject of our bilateral relations. This was quite understandable
                        because in a way it was difficult to erect a wall separating purely
                        bilateral from international affairs. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> still believed that the problems between us could be
                        discussed in their specifics to the extent this was possible. For this
                        reason he did not intend to enlarge on the first subject he had talked about
                        today. The Secretary had incidentally touched on matters of regional impact
                        and other major international problems that went beyond the limits of our
                        bilateral relations. He would only emphasize to the Secretary that in his
                        view the Secretary’s analysis of our bilateral relations and the current
                        state of affairs generally suffered from being one-sided and wrong in terms
                        of its characterization of Soviet foreign policy, which could not be
                        acceptable. Now <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to
                        turn to specific matters and briefly, in view of limited time, set out his
                        side’s assessment of the problem.</p>
                    <pb n="446" facs="0477" xml:id="pg_446"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">INF</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> turned to the question of
                        nuclear weapons in Europe, the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        decision of 1979 and the US position and Soviet position at the negotiations
                        initiated here in Geneva. He would provide the Soviet assessment of the
                        state of this problem. In this regard, he had to emphasize above all that
                        the US position, as seen from the Soviet side, which had been expressed in
                        US statements by the President, by the Secretary personally, by other
                        Ministers of the US Administration and by the US Delegation in Geneva,
                        amounted to building up the US nuclear strategic forces directed against the
                        Soviet Union. The US was building up these forces in violation of the
                        principle of equality and equal security which had guided the Soviet side up
                        to now in its dealings with previous US Administrations. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that he had not misspoken when
                        he had said “strategic” nuclear forces. That was not a slip of the tongue.
                        The purpose of nuclear weapons deployment in accordance with the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> decision was what gave this deployment a
                        character that was tantamount to the deployment of strategic weapons. All
                        these weapons were aimed at targets in the Soviet Union, not even to mention
                        the territories of the Soviet Union’s allies. At the same time, those SS–20
                        missiles which the West was given to painting in such fearful colors were
                        medium-range missiles, not a single one of which could reach the territory
                        of the United States. Consequently the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> decision was to deploy weapons that were directed at
                        targets on Soviet territory, while, he would repeat again, not a single
                        Soviet missile in question could reach the territory of the US. Thus,
                        qualitatively these were absolutely different categories of weapons.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not believe that he
                        was here dealing with some sort of attempt to outsmart the Soviet Union. He
                        was certain that the Secretary was well aware of the facts as just stated.
                        He was not sure as to who played the first fiddle in the United States,
                        military or civilian leaders, but he was sure that the Secretary was well
                        aware of these facts. The Secretary surely knew that the Soviet side knew
                        that the US was building up strategic weapons against the Soviet Union and
                        he was also sure that the Secretary knew that the Soviet side knew that the
                        Secretary was well aware of this fact. That was the first thing that he
                        wanted to emphasize with respect to this subject. It did not augur well for
                        discussions between us or for Soviet-US relations in general. Furthermore,
                        Washington obstinately objects to inclusion in the overall balance of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> forces the nuclear weaponry belonging to
                        Britain and France. He had to say that this will not work and, in fact,
                        there could not even be a serious discussion on that basis. How could the
                        Soviet Union possibly agree to have all that weaponry left outside of
                        consideration and outside of the count of what constitutes the East-West
                        balance? While it was good that negotiations in Geneva between the Soviet
                            <pb n="447" facs="0478" xml:id="pg_447"/>Union and the United States on
                        medium-range systems in Europe had started, in the final analysis the
                        nuclear weapons of the United Kingdom and France would have to be counted in
                        the balance, even though the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and France
                        were not party to the negotiations. It seemed to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that he had mentioned this in New York. If not, he
                        could tell the Secretary now that this question had been raised with a
                        previous US administration. At one time he had a conversation with President
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> at the White House, in the
                        course of which he had told President <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> what he had just now told the Secretary. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> had said that he did, of
                        course, fully realize and understand that the British and French forces were
                        directed at the Soviet Union and thus formed grounds for concern on the
                        Soviet side. He further said that he had considered the matter but had not
                        yet reached a conclusion. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did
                        not believe that former President <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> could have forgotten this conversation. In any case,
                        a record is surely available in the White House. Today there was a new
                        administration in Washington, but the Soviet Union could not agree to being
                        confronted with a new situation just because of that fact. After all, it was
                        completely impossible for the Soviet side not to take into account somewhere
                        around 250 nuclear systems directed at the Soviet Union. These systems did,
                        after all, belong to US allies tied to the United States by treaty
                        obligations.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> characterized this as a major
                        question of fundamental importance. What should be counted in the overall
                        balance was indeed crucial. The US suggestion that <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> forego the deployment of its new medium-range missiles and
                        the Soviet Union eliminate all its SS–20s, SS–4s and SS–5s sounded very
                        simple. The US side called it the “zero option.” In fact, zero was not even
                        in sight. How could one talk about zero when what would remain after
                        elimination of all medium-range missiles would be massive numbers of
                        aircraft aboard US carriers cruising the Mediterranean and the Atlantic?
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> noted incidentally that
                        it seemed that US carriers believed their home to be in European waters.
                        Furthermore, there would remain all the other Western nuclear-capable
                        aircraft that would not count in the balance. Agreement by the Soviet Union
                        to such a position could be ruled out completely. In fact, the Soviet side
                        was astonished that such a proposal could have been made, since it was so
                        crude and so drastically directed against the Soviet Union that it should
                        not have been made in the first place. Nevertheless, it had been submitted
                        for consideration. “That will not work.” All nuclear-capable aircraft must
                        be counted in as a subject at the negotiations and subsequent agreement.
                        Naturally, in such an event, all corresponding Soviet nuclear-capable
                        aircraft would also be counted. The Soviet side had said so at the meetings
                        of Delegations in Geneva. Surely, the Secretary was aware of that proposal
                        of the Soviet Delegation in Geneva.</p>

                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that, as the Secretary
                        knew, the Soviet side had also presented a zero option. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had done so during his visit to
                        the Federal Republic of Germany, but no positive reaction to that proposal
                        had been received from the US side.<note n="6" xml:id="d137fn6">Reference is
                            to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s November 23, 1981,
                            proposal to freeze deployment of medium-range nuclear missiles. See John

                        a zero option could not bring the negotiations a single step closer towards
                        an accord. There is simply no place for a zero in that kind of option.
                        Perhaps calling it a zero was due to a misunderstanding, or perhaps one
                        would have to revise the rule of mathematics to arrive at zero on this
                        basis.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> pointed out that, furthermore,
                        if the US proposal were accepted, the Soviet Union would find itself in a
                        worse position than if the present situation were simply continued and the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> decision for the deployment of
                        Pershing-IIs and cruise missiles were implemented. Thus, neither the first
                        option nor the second made it possible to arrive at an accord.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted next to touch on a
                        third matter in the US position at the negotiations, which was also not
                        acceptable. It was said that the Soviet Union must eliminate its SS–20s, and
                        not only those deployed elsewhere. It was implied that no one knew what the
                        Soviet Union had beyond the Urals in the Asiatic portion of Soviet
                        territory. Thus, some thinktank researchers in the US, writing their
                        theoretical dissertations, advocated limiting and reducing various arms
                        beyond the territory of Europe, in other words, that an agreement to be
                        concluded would have to be global in nature. Why was this being done? Why
                        was it suggested that SS–20 missiles be eliminated wherever they were
                        deployed? It was hardly adequate to express astonishment, for this was a
                        solution that was simply unthinkable and objectionable. He would ask the
                        Secretary if the Soviet Union should not be concerned by the situation in
                        Asia, when everyone knew that China did exist and Chinese policy toward the
                        Soviet Union was a matter of common knowledge. Furthermore, there were
                        specific situations along the entire perimeter of the Soviet Union outside
                        of Europe, in the East, the South, the Southeast and the Middle East. In all
                        of these areas the United States had weapons systems, including medium-range
                        systems; he felt no need to enumerate them but would be prepared to do so if
                        the Secretary so desired. In short, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to stress that the question of eliminating
                        all SS–20s, no matter where located, could not deserve serious
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> now wanted to touch on another
                        aspect of this same issue. Why had the Soviet Union deployed SS–20s in the
                        first place? <pb n="449" facs="0480" xml:id="pg_449"/>It seemed to some
                        people on the US side that everything had been fine in terms of the balance
                        in Europe, when suddenly this fearful SS–20 missile had appeared. At first
                        an idyllic situation, and then, suddenly, Armageddon. He wanted to emphasize
                        to the Secretary, and realized that some people might not like it, that
                        Soviet SS–20 deployment was a response to the systematic modernization of
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s weapons, above all those of the
                        United States. There had appeared to be a consistent plan to modernize
                        forward-based systems and to build new weapons by US allies. The Soviet
                        Union had watched this development carefully in order to determine whether
                        this was a one-time occurrence or if it was a considered permanent policy.
                        The modernization of forward-based systems and the construction of new
                        weapons by western allies had not ceased, evidently there was a
                        corresponding plan which was being implemented to its conclusion. Thus, the
                        West had raised the capabilities of these systems to such an extent that the
                        Soviet Union felt compelled to respond by deployment of SS–20s.</p>
                    <p>He wanted to stress that this purposeful policy with regard to US
                        forward-based systems could only be seen as an attempt to shift the balance
                        of forces in Europe in such a way as to favor the West. This was why the
                        Soviet Union had deployed SS–20s, but this had not changed the balance in
                        Europe at all. He would emphasize that no change in that balance had
                        occurred. He would go even further and say that even if the Soviet Union
                        doubled or tripled the number of its medium-range missiles in Europe, the US
                        advantage would nevertheless remain. The reason for that was that US
                        forward-based systems were directed against targets on the territory of the
                        Soviet Union. This was an unalterable geographic factor. In fact, it was
                        almost as if Europe was a kind of launch pad which had been moved from US
                        territory to European territory.</p>
                    <p>The geographic factor, too, had to be taken into account in determining the
                        balance of forces. The material side alone could be put into a balance, but
                        that would not alter the substance of the matter. He noted in an aside that
                        even in terms of the material factor, the West now had 50 percent more
                        warheads in place than the Soviet Union. The geographic factor had enormous
                        significance from the standpoint of negotiations and agreement. It had
                        always had its effect at past negotiations and did have its effect today. He
                        would repeat that even if the Soviet Union doubled or tripled the number of
                        SS–20s, the US would still retain its advantage. And yet, the US kept
                        ignoring this factor in its Delegation’s statements and proposals. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> believed the situation to be so
                        clear that it was not even necessary to talk about it. It was simply a fact
                        that existed and he would ask the Secretary to imagine himself in the
                        position of the Soviet side. He would then understand that for the Soviet
                        side this fact was indeed decisive.</p>
                    <pb n="450" facs="0481" xml:id="pg_450"/>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that he had just
                        enumerated the main difficulties which today separated the positions of the
                        two sides at the negotiations. The US side completely ignores the
                        objectivity of the Soviet position. He would ask the Secretary to take a
                        look at it again in light of the explanations <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had just supplied.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> thought it would be useful to
                        consider the present stage of the negotiations in Geneva. It seemed to him
                        that it would now be useful to provide some bench marks, as it were, for the
                        Delegations of the two sides to be guided by. Perhaps it might be useful to
                        agree on some sort of bilateral statement or understanding to the effect
                        that that two sides would adhere to the principle of equality and would make
                        every effort to bring the positions of the sides closer together. With a
                        view to proposing such a joint document—it did not matter what it might be
                            called—<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had prepared a
                        number of points which he would now present. They were as follows:</p>
                    <p>“a. In accordance with the principle of equality and equal security the
                        agreement will include and take into account all medium-range nuclear arms,
                        that is, arms with a range or combat radius of 1000 kilometers and more,
                        located on the territory of Europe or the waters adjacent thereto, or
                        intended for use in Europe.</p>
                    <p>b. Proceeding from a desire to lower the level of the aforementioned systems
                        on the side of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> as well as that of the
                        Soviet Union to the maximum extent, the agreement will provide for a
                        reduction in their numbers down to 300 systems on each side by the end of
                        1990, along with the establishment of an interim level of 600 systems by the
                        end of 1985.</p>
                    <p>c. Each side will have the right at its own discretion to determine the
                        composition of the arms to be reduced, and within the limits of the agreed
                        reduced levels the sides, at their own discretion, will be able to carry out
                        replacement and modernization of arms, with limits for such activities to be
                        determined additionally.</p>
                    <p>d. The basic method used to reduce medium-range arms will be their
                        destruction, which does not rule out the possibility of withdrawing a
                        certain portion of such arms beyond agreed boundaries.</p>
                    <p>e. The agreement will contain provisions ensuring adequate verification of
                        compliance with the obligations provided for in the contemplated
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>f. The agreement will remain in force until December 31, 1990, at which time
                        its term may be extended by agreement between the sides.</p>
                    <p>g. While the negotiations are in progress, the sides will refrain from any
                        activities to deploy new medium-range nuclear arms in the <pb n="451" facs="0482" xml:id="pg_451"/>European region. Those medium-range weapons
                        that have already been deployed in this area by the present time will be
                        frozen quantitatively and qualitatively. Nonetheless, either side may at its
                        own discretion reduce the existing level of its own medium-range arms.”</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> expressed the hope that the
                        Secretary and his Government would consider these proposals objectively and
                        in a realistic and level-headed manner. Perhaps something along these lines
                        might be useful in terms of the negotiations. The reason that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had spoken on this subject was that
                        this problem had indeed become so acute at the present moment. There were
                        other acute questions, of course, which he had touched on earlier and they
                        would surely discuss them at their second meeting today. But he had wanted
                        to make sure that the US side understood the Soviet position on the subject
                        of medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe with crystal clarity.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary wanted to speak briefly on the subject under discussion here.
                        All of <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s comments confirmed
                        the US saying that not only beauty, but also the threat, is in the eye of
                        the beholder. At their second meeting today the Secretary planned to point
                        out to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that the latter’s
                        proposal was a clear reiteration of days of discussion here in Geneva
                        between the negotiators and of the underlying fact that we both assess the
                        threat differently. The data which we carry in no way can support the points
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had made. The Secretary
                        would want to go over with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        the historic points he had touched on with reference to the strategic threat
                        posed by the SS–20 missiles here in Europe, as well as globally. As an old
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> expert, the Secretary had a good
                        appreciation of the character of the Soviet force structure. He believed it
                        most important in terms of the interests of both sides that the Delegations
                        exchange data and try to sort out this problem as we had done at <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. At present our views were diametrically
                        opposite. If we looked at the global or regional threat, we came to the
                        conclusion that overwhelming Soviet superiority was absolutely clear. Thus,
                        it took specifically contrived data to arrive at the approximately 1000
                        launchers for each side, as talked about by the Soviet Delegation. The fact
                        of the matter was that it was clear that the Secretary could not in any way
                        accept the proposal <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had
                        outlined, because it was merely a detailed reiteration of what Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPH_1">Nitze</persName> had already received from
                        the Soviet Delegation in Geneva. He believed the best way to proceed would
                        be to examine the data, for only then could we structure the kind of
                        reduction we had talked about in our proposal. The old question of US
                        systems versus European systems leads to a dilemma that only reinforces
                        Soviet superiority. We had to find a different way in order to arrive at an
                        appropriate solution. <pb n="452" facs="0483" xml:id="pg_452"/>The Secretary
                        was sure that the two sides did have the ingenuity to do so.</p>

               </p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not know
                        whether Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had anything
                        to add on the question of medium-range nuclear systems in Europe. If the
                        Secretary had nothing to add, then there was nothing further that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> could say on that subject.
                        Accordingly, he proposed to move on. Though <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not know the Secretary’s possibilities, he,
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, wanted to address
                        briefly the matter of strategic arms and to listen to the Secretary’s views
                        on that subject. Lately there had been speculations galore in the press,
                        including speculations to the effect that the Secretary did not want to
                        discuss this issue at the current meeting. There were even press suggestions
                        that the Secretary’s intention was to displease the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to think that the situation
                        was different, that such reports were incorrect and that they misinterpreted
                        the views of the Secretary and the US Administration. This was a serious
                        issue. The Soviet Union thought that now that discussions were underway on
                        medium-range nuclear arms, the two states should deal with this question as
                        well. After all, time was marching on and by force of circumstances it would
                        be necessary to deal with the subject. But the more time elapsed, the more
                        difficult it would become to deal with the subject, and the more difficult
                        it would be to find appropriate solutions. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted <pb n="453" facs="0484" xml:id="pg_453"/>to
                        believe that the Secretary was prepared to exchange views on this matter, at
                        least briefly. If so, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, too,
                        was prepared to address it.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that in the spirit of the principle of equal security
                        he wanted to comment very briefly on some observations made this morning by
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> on the INF topic.<note n="2" xml:id="d138fn2">See <ref target="#d137">Document
                            137</ref>.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had really touched on three
                        areas, and during lunch the Secretary had an opportunity to consider
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s comments regarding the
                        written proposal he had read. The Secretary considered it important to
                        reiterate again the basic observation he had made regarding the Geneva
                        discussions thus far. What was involved was a basic difference in approach
                        in assessing data, threats and arms, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had made the point very
                        vigorously that the arms in Western Europe were strategic for the Soviet
                        Union. That, of course, was also true with respect to our Western European
                        allies, especially in the case of the SS–20. Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had raised the question of global
                        versus regional. The Secretary wanted to assure <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that our problem involved mobile application of
                        these systems, especially medium-range missiles, the capability of shifting
                        and moving them.</p>
                    <p>It was necessary to deal with this matter at the ongoing negotiations in such
                        a way that all sides would be confident that the picture was balanced.
                        Certain statements had been made in Geneva to the effect that aircraft
                        carriers and aircraft on them, the A–6s and the A–7s, which were never
                        deployed here, even FB–111s which were in the United States, were included
                        in Soviet force balances. Accordingly, it was a very difficult problem to be
                        sure that we viewed the threats to each country in a common perspective.</p>
                    <p>The US saw a number of flaws in the Soviet presentation of the balance of
                        capability. The Soviet position presented thus far in Geneva obscured the
                        fact that the Soviet side had a greater number of nuclear systems, including
                        land-based missiles which have great precision and involve greater accuracy,
                        and also have numerous delivery capabilities. The Soviet position presented
                        in Geneva ignored warheads and focused only on launchers, although a more
                        significant measure of capability involves the question of warheads. The
                        Soviet side insisted on including the arms of the United Kingdom and France,
                        in the balance, overlooking the fact that these were strategic systems of
                        sovereign states outside US control.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had focused earlier on
                        FB–111s, A–6s and A–7s, but the Soviet side wanted to exclude several Soviet
                        aircraft with ranges comparable to those of US systems which allegedly
                        constituted a threat to the Soviet Union. It was necessary to have a balance
                        in the figures <pb n="454" facs="0485" xml:id="pg_454"/>and to resolve the
                        differences in that regard. Until that occurred, it would be very difficult
                        to make meaningful proposals on reductions. For example, the Secretary did
                        not know how to tabulate the balances, even including allied systems. The
                        Soviet inventory was overwhelmingly superior. The 580 SS–20s, SS–5s and
                        SS–4s were associated with over 1,140 warheads, and using the approach the
                        Soviet side had applied with regard to US nuclear-capable aircraft, the
                        Soviet inventory involved 8,500 systems. On the other hand, F–111s, F–16s
                        and F–4s added up to only 1,800. While the Secretary did not want to take
                        the time now to discuss these numbers, because this should be left to
                        experts, he had listed them in order to point out that this is where the
                        problem started. He thought that, generally speaking, we should work toward
                        resolving these approaches.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the second area he wished to raise involved <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s rationale regarding Soviet
                        deployment of SS–20s. The Secretary knew the facts because he had much
                        experience with <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and with military
                        forces, and had witnessed the evolution of the threat to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Europe. He also knew very clearly the
                        situation regarding development and deployment of SS–20s, because at that
                        time—that is, in the late ’60s and early ’70s—he had been Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s Deputy in Washington. In this
                        connection, it was necessary to take into account other dramatic changes in
                        the Soviet posture, such as an increase in troop strength by one-third, a
                        thickening of the combat echelons, a buildup in tank divisions and in mobile
                        divisions, along with greater fire power. There had also been the most
                        dramatic buildup in aircraft of modern times. The entire character of the
                        Soviet Air Force had changed with respect to Western Europe during the
                        period 1970 to 1978/79. It had gone from air defensive capabilities to
                        long-range, dual-capable offensive capabilities. Manpower advantages had
                        gone to a two-to-one ratio, the advantage in tanks to a three-to-one ratio.
                        In the course of this, the number of nuclear warheads had increased
                        six-to-one. All that had occurred simultaneously with the deployment of the
                        SS–20s.</p>
                    <p>No objective observer could attribute SS–20 deployment to a reaction to
                        Western modernization at a time when more than 1,000 warheads were withdrawn
                        on our side. The Secretary was familiar with that withdrawal because he had
                        fought that decision, but it was nevertheless carried out. It was important
                        to get a clear picture on where we were with respect to SS–20s and how we
                        got there, because only from that standpoint would it be possible to
                        establish some basis for reductions which were in order. The Secretary had
                        presented the above to be sure the record was clear in light of what
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had said this morning,
                        and so that the Soviet side would understand our concern.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary continued that, with respect to the question raised by
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> about SALT/START, we,
                        too, had read all about that. It was true that we were not prepared, as we
                        might have been in the <pb n="455" facs="0486" xml:id="pg_455"/>absence of
                        events, to move forward to discussing this subject now. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would know that we had worked
                        intensively, as the Secretary had noted in September, to prepare our
                        position. He hoped that we could initiate <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> negotiations at the earliest possible time. Those
                        preparations were continuing, but at this time the Secretary was not
                        prepared to engage in a substantive or procedural discussion, such as on the
                        time of resuming these negotiations, and would not be prepared until the
                        climate was right. When the climate was right, he knew that the President
                        would make this very evident through diplomatic channels. The Secretary
                        hoped that this would occur in the not too distant future.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would know that, as the
                        President said in November, the latter was anxious to resume the dialogue on
                        this subject and was seeking substantial reductions in strategic arms. He
                        thought that it was evident from the current INF discussions that there was
                        a strong and clear interrelationship between the two topics, and that
                        progress would be produced simultaneously with regard to INF, as well as
                        strategic systems. The Secretary wanted to underline the relationship
                        between the two. Therefore, we would always approach INF from the standpoint
                        of negotiations on strategic systems, even though there would be different
                        venues and different delegations. The Secretary had wanted to make this
                        observation, as <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had done with
                        regard to the areas he wanted to discuss, because in his view it had been
                        important for him to respond so that there be no question about the area of
                        strategic arms. We were here to listen to each other, not to raise fences to
                        communications on questions of major significance to our overall
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> replied that he had little to
                        add to what he had said this morning with regard to medium-range nuclear
                        arms in Europe. He wanted to emphasize that, of course, he could not accept
                        the statement that the SS–20 deployment was not caused by corresponding
                        actions by the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> bloc. It was precisely
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> activities—and <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> was constantly modernizing its
                        corresponding nuclear arms—which had forced the Soviet Union to deploy the
                        SS–20s, even though this had not resolved the problem by a long shot, that
                        is, the problem caused by <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> in
                        upsetting the balance of nuclear arms in Europe. Failure by the Secretary to
                        recognize that the factors with respect to the Soviet Union were justified
                        showed that the US position was not objective, and the Soviet Union could
                        not accept the Secretary’s views of the US position or the Soviet
                        position.</p>
                    <p>In trying to reverse the ratio between US and Soviet arms in Europe, the
                        Secretary was ignoring one simple fact, namely that with respect to
                        nuclear-capable aircraft, for example, the count proposed by <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and US representatives involved
                        understating the combat radius of US <pb n="456" facs="0487" xml:id="pg_456"/>aircraft and artificially exaggerating the combat radius of Soviet
                        aircraft. The Soviet Delegation had partly noted this already; it had cited
                        specific types of aircraft, that is, aircraft with a range of “X”. The US
                        side on the other hand, without offering any proof had contested this data,
                        claiming that the range was “X plus Y”. The US side pretended that it knew
                        more about Soviet systems than the Soviet side, and was engaging in this
                        practice in order to fit the figures to its preconceived notion. The Soviet
                        side had encountered this more than once, and the Soviet Union could not
                        accept that kind of approach. The US side’s failure to accept Soviet data
                        involved certain preconceived notions. This was being done artificially,
                        intentionally. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not want
                        to attribute these actions to the Secretary personally, he did not know who
                        was responsible, but he was asking the Secretary to sort out the figures
                        objectively and if the Secretary did this he would see an entirely different
                        picture. The force relationship cited by US representatives was incorrect,
                        it was a total invention.</p>
                    <p>Of course, the Secretary could respond, “no, we are correct.” If the
                        Secretary were to say that, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        could not but express his regrets that the US position involved such an
                        absence of seriousness. The question arises, what individuals, what
                        organizations supply such data which are at odds with reality. For example,
                        some Soviet aircraft which played no significant role in Europe and posed no
                        threat in the European arena were claimed to be strategic.<note n="3" xml:id="d138fn3">Reference is to a dispute during the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II negotiations over whether the
                            Soviet Tu–22M “Backfire” bomber could reach the continental United
                            States.</note> In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to cite the example of Cuba where the US side
                        was making absurd assertions about certain aircraft being nuclear-delivery
                        vehicles, though in fact these aircraft are of no significance to the region
                        involved. Nevertheless, the US was perceiving them as a threat. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had mentioned Cuba because the
                        analogy could not be escaped. He did not wish to call this matter by its
                        proper name, it was best to refrain from such words. There had been at least
                        a minimum amount of objectivity during preparation of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Agreements, and as a result we had moved forward. If
                        that principle were not adhered to now, if it were crossed out, it would be
                        very difficult to make any progress.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, turning to strategic arms,
                        said that he was very sorry to hear the Secretary say that he was unable at
                        this time to talk about resumption of the strategic arms negotiations, to
                        hear him say that this entire topic had to await a better climate,
                        presumably not only in Soviet-US relations, but also internationally. This
                        was a fallacious conception which did not promise anything good. The US will
                        gain nothing from this. If the US regarded this as a way of applying
                        pressure, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        <pb n="457" facs="0488" xml:id="pg_457"/>would point out that the Soviet
                        Union did not recognize such pressure. This was contrary to conducting
                        relations between states and such a tactic did not work when major powers
                        were involved.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union, of course, would try to make it clear that it did not bear
                        the responsibility for failure to resume strategic arms talks, for failure
                        even to obtain clarity regarding the time for such a resumption. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> thought that it would not be
                        difficult to make this clear to the general public. After all, there can
                        only be two alternatives: either one is in favor of such talks or one is
                        opposed to them. The Soviet Union was very much in favor of them, while the
                        US was opposed to them, was putting them off. That should be clear to
                        anyone. As <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had said earlier,
                        he could only express regret concerning this position of the US
                        Administration.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Southern Africa, Cuba and Nicaragua</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that since the Secretary
                        had already touched on the problem of Cuba, he, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, would expand on this matter by setting forth the
                        Soviet Union’s standpoint regarding the complex of problems involving Cuba,
                        Angola and Namibia. He wanted to express some considerations and present
                        some Soviet views on how the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        should act in order to facilitate and promote a resolution of this complex
                        of problems. The Soviet Union had studied these matters in detail and had
                        come to the conclusion that a comprehensive approach could facilitate a
                        solution. The Soviet Union was convinced that this was a constructive and
                        objective standpoint. At our New York meeting the Secretary had spoken very
                        sharply on the question of Cuba.<note n="4" xml:id="d138fn4">See <ref target="#d90">Documents 90</ref> and <ref target="#d91">91</ref>.</note> Subsequently, the US Administration and the Secretary
                        himself had made very sharp statements, and more than once. The Soviet Union
                        knew that the US was consciously exacerbating the situation with regard to
                        Cuba. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not mean to blame
                        the Secretary personally, he was referring to the US Administration. But
                        Cuba did not merit such treatment. Cuba is being painted as having
                        incredible capabilities and as posing an unbelievable threat, both
                        quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>
                    <p>In fact, the arms supplied by the Soviet Union in the past and at present
                        were of infinitesimal quantities. They did not constitute a threat to the US
                        and were not intended for that. Cuba, whether it had such arms or not, did
                        not pose a threat now and had not posed a threat in the past. The US was
                        trying to blame Cuba for situations in other Latin American countries,
                        notably in El Salvador. Clearly, there was no justification for making such
                        changes. But, the US evidently needed this to maintain the fires in Latin
                        America. What was the reason for <pb n="458" facs="0489" xml:id="pg_458"/>this? When Castro directly asked the US to furnish proof and facts in
                        support of US allegations, the US did not cite any evidence, it did not even
                        make an effort to cite such evidence. The reason was that there were no
                        facts in support of US charges about Cuban complicity.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> continued that what he had
                        said about Cuba also applied to Nicaragua. In New York, the Secretary had
                        referred to his meeting with the Foreign Minister of Nicaragua. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had also spoken to him, and the
                        Foreign Minister had given him an overall account of his meeting with the
                        Secretary. Of course, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not
                        know whether he had been told everything or not. Incidentally, the Foreign
                        Minister of Nicaragua had said that his country wanted good relations with
                        the US. He had said this during a visit to Moscow several weeks ago. Cuba
                        certainly did not pose a threat to El Salvador, and neither did Nicaragua.
                        Yet the US side refers to such a threat here and elsewhere. Accordingly, the
                        Soviet Union has concluded that the underlying reason was US dislike for the
                        social system in Cuba. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        recalled that he had told this to the Secretary during the New York meeting.
                        But the Secretary should understand very well that the form of government
                        should not be imposed on others. That was an internal matter, a result of
                        social development.</p>
                    <p>At the last meeting, the Secretary had raised questions regarding Cuban
                        activities in Ethiopia and Angola. It was true that there were Cuban troops
                        in Angola. The Secretary had virtually claimed that the Cubans ran the show
                        in Angola, he had for all intents and purposes suggested that through its
                        military forces Cuba was calling the tune in some areas of Africa. But
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> knew the real intentions
                        of the Cubans, and the Secretary would recognize that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was sure of his facts. Thus,
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> could say that neither
                        now nor in the past had Cuba done anything evil in rendering aid to Ethiopia
                        and Angola. Cuba was acting legally, consistent with the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter and at the request of the
                        Governments of Angola and Ethiopia. Accordingly, there were no grounds for
                        reproaching Cuba for anything. After all, US troops were stationed in dozens
                        and dozens of countries. And what about other Western countries? France has
                        repeatedly introduced its forces into a number of countries, notably in
                        Africa. Nor is Great Britain innocent, although at present its abilities
                        have declined; history has played a role in this. Why was the US singling
                        out Cuba? Could anyone really believe that Fidel Castro has decided to take
                        over all of Africa. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was sure
                        that the Secretary did not believe this.</p>
                    <p>Turning to Namibia, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that
                        this issue was in fact separate from the issue of Cuban forces in Angola and
                        Ethiopia. Namibia should be granted independence in line with the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolution.<note n="5" xml:id="d138fn5">Reference is to U.N. Resolution 435, passed on September 29, 1978,
                            which called for the establishment of an independent Namibia.</note>
                        <pb n="459" facs="0490" xml:id="pg_459"/>With Washington’s blessings, South
                        African troops were occupying Namibia. The “group of five,” which included
                        US representatives, was operating under the wings of the South African
                        occupation forces. Today South Africa had grabbed a piece of Namibian
                        territory for a military base, probably with US agreement, though the
                        Secretary should know this better than <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. South Africa has carried out aggression against
                        Angola, carried out bombing raids against that country, and at this very
                        moment when we were talking, was maintaining several battalions of troops
                        there.</p>
                    <p>Surely the Secretary could not believe that Angola had no right to ask for
                        assistance to defend itself. Moveover, there was the question of <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">Unita</gloss> and all manner of other bands opposing
                        the government. Naturally, the Secretary could say that such bands were an
                        internal matter. Indeed, most of the personnel were Angolans, but a large
                        part of the commanders were white mercenaries from other countries,
                        including the US. They were operating with the tacit approval of their
                        governments. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was not familiar
                        with the number of these mercenaries or who they were, but the Soviet Union
                        was studying the matter and would have an answer. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not know the number of
                        mercenaries in <persName corresp="#p_SJM_1">Savimbi</persName>’s<note n="6" xml:id="d138fn6">Reference to <persName corresp="#p_SJM_1">Jonas

                        information. But whether the US did or did not help, the Soviet Union would
                        know the answer soon. One could not divorce Cuban activities in Southern
                        Africa from what was being done there by the US and other states. In order
                        to alter the situation it was necessary to cease assistance to <persName corresp="#p_SJM_1">Savimbi</persName>, to stop South Africa’s aggression
                        against Angola and to permit Namibia to become a truly sovereign state.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said he now wanted to
                        formulate what he would call a constructive solution to this complex of
                        problems. The Namibian issue was a separate one, but it so happened that it
                        had become linked in time because South African aggression against Angola is
                        related to South African aggression against Namibia. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to present for the
                        Secretary’s consideration a Cuban plan, which <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was presenting with Cuba’s knowledge. To begin with,
                        he wanted to outline the Soviet Union’s position on this question, after
                        which he would address the outline of the Cuban plan. Inasmuch as this was a
                        concentrated program, he wanted to dispense with a Russian language
                        presentation and asked his interpreter to read from a prepared
                        statement:</p>
                    <p>—First, settlement of the Namibian problem should be carried out in strict
                        conformity with <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions which provide
                        for the granting to Namibia of full independence with the preservation of
                        its territorial <pb n="460" facs="0491" xml:id="pg_460"/>integrity,
                        including the region of Walvis Bay. South African troops must be completely
                        withdrawn from Namibia. Any international understanding on that question
                        must be acceptable to the independent African states and <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>.<note n="7" xml:id="d138fn7">Reference
                            is to the South West African People’s Organization, the leading
                            opposition movement to South African rule in Namibia.</note> The US, for
                        its part, also should propose precisely such a solution of the Namibian
                        problem. The Soviet Union, as a permanent member of the Security Council,
                        also has in mind to play an active part in the Namibian settlement.</p>
                    <p>—Second, there must be an end to all aggressive activities by South Africa
                        against the People’s Republic of Angola, whether directly or through support
                        for <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">Unita</gloss> actions. The United States and
                        other Western powers, along with South Africa, must cease all support for
                            <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">Unita</gloss> and other anti-government
                        groupings in Angola, whose hostile activities against the Angolan Government
                        are directed from the outside, i.e., with regard to the territorial
                        integrity and security of Angola, including its inalienable part, the
                        Cabinda Province, must be secured.</p>
                    <p>—Third, the presence of Cuban forces in Angola and the question of their
                        possible withdrawal therefrom is, of course, a bilateral matter between Cuba
                        and Angola. The objective reasons why Cuban forces were sent to, and are in
                        Angolan territory, involve the defense of the sovereignty and territorial
                        integrity of Angola against aggression by South Africa, as well as against
                        the bandit formations of <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">Unita</gloss>, which are
                        armed by and whose activity is directed from, the outside.</p>
                    <p>—Fourth. Therefore, withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola can be carried out
                        when the threat to the security of the People’s Republic of Angola is
                        removed and when the Government of Angola takes such a decision by virtue of
                        its sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>—Fifth. As is known, as far back as April 1976 the Governments of Angola and
                        Cuba agreed on a plan for the gradual withdrawal of Cuban forces from
                        Angola, and less than one year thereafter the numerical strength of the
                        Cuban military contingent was reduced by more than one-third. But
                        subsequently, at the request of the Angolan leadership, implementation of
                        this plan was suspended in connection with the intensified aggressive
                        activities of South African racists and mounting support by them and the US
                        for formations hostile to the Government of the People’s Republic of
                        Angola.</p>
                    <p>—Sixth, resolution of the Namibian problems along the lines described above,
                        and a guaranteed cessation of all forms of aggressive activities against the
                        People’s Republic of Angola, will enable the Governments of Angola and Cuba
                        to return to the implementation of the previously agreed plan for the
                        gradual withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola.</p>

                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that he had wanted to say
                        all the above by way of summarizing the views of the Soviet Union. Cuba had
                        also provided the Soviet Union with its own assessment of the situation.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to inform the
                        Secretary of this assessment and in order to save time asked his interpreter
                        to read the Cuban text, which he then handed over (attached).<note n="8" xml:id="d138fn8">Attached but not printed is an undated paper entitled
                            “Cuban Paper on Angola, Namibia and South Africa.”</note> In reply to
                        the Secretary’s question, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        answered that this text had not been released elsewhere, that it was
                        prepared for the Secretary’s benefit. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to add that the Soviet Union viewed this plan
                        by way of a solution to the entire complex of problems which were linked in
                        the US view, that is, regarding Cuba, Angola, Namibia and South Africa. Of
                        course, in the Soviet view the relationship was different, but since there
                        is a relationship in time, these issues could be grouped together. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had already emphasized that Namibia
                        and Angola involved different questions, but South Africa, through its
                        aggression, had tied everything into one knot. The Soviet Union saw a
                        possibility for resolving these problems, provided the US approached them
                        with understanding. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> thought
                        that this would also be useful from the standpoint of Soviet-US relations
                        and that perhaps it would cast a ray of light on the overall international
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary responded that he had listened with great care. He had looked
                        for and listened for the gleam of light of a possible solution within the
                        dense jungle of propaganda statements. He wanted to deal with these
                        statements first, and noted that he seemed to have discerned more of a
                        glimmer of light in the Soviet articulation than in the Cuban one. With
                        regard to Cuba, he wanted to remark sharply about Cuba’s inflation of
                        tensions. As <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> knew, the
                        Secretary had discussed this issue in Mexico with the Cuban Vice
                            President<note n="9" xml:id="d138fn9">On November 23, 1981, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> met with Cuban Vice President
                            Carlos Rafael Rodriguez in Mexico City.</note> and had further discussed
                        it with him in New York in terms of future relations between the two
                        countries. Asked by <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> when this
                        discussion had taken place, the Secretary replied that it had occurred some
                        three or four weeks ago. We were carefully assessing the most recent
                        intelligence information regarding Soviet shipments to Cuba, which we did
                        not regard as purely symbolic. We will make our decision on this in the days
                        and weeks ahead. Even in the discussions with the Cuban Vice President it
                        had been clear, and the latter admitted, that Cuba was sponsoring revolution
                        in Colombia and that the Cuban presence in Nicaragua at this time was in
                        excess of 4,000.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> interrupted that these were
                        teachers and physicians.</p>
                    <pb n="462" facs="0493" xml:id="pg_462"/>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that at least 1,500 of them were military personnel.
                        There was one Cuban for every twenty Nicaraguan soldiers. These were not
                        advisors, this was command and control.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> repeated that they were
                        doctors.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted again that there were at least 1,500 military personnel.
                        We were also well aware of the direction from Nicaragua of so-called
                        guerrillas in El Salvador. We were listening to radio broadcasts and
                        monitoring the shipment of arms by air. This week the Secretary had spoken
                        to a Canadian journalist who had been invited to join the guerrilla groups
                        in El Salvador in order to write a story supporting Nicaraguan forces. There
                        was no question on this. We were listening daily and hourly to radio
                        transmissions. The Secretary thought that it was essential to make note of
                        the unsatisfactory character of these activities, which must be understood
                        by all.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, the Secretary, too, like <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, had spoken to the Nicaraguan Foreign Minister in
                        Santa Lucia. Incidentally, the Secretary agreed that that regime wanted good
                        relations with the US. It was very unpopular. Just last week there were
                        riots during which Sandinista forces had fired tear gas. The level of
                        dissatisfaction among the people of Nicaragua was growing daily because of
                        its police state tactics, internment without due process, suspension of
                        civil liberties, destruction of the private sector and militarization of the
                        regime. The Foreign Minister had told the Secretary that there would be no
                        delivery of MiG aircraft. We took this assurance very seriously and expected
                        that it would be adhered to.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary recalled telling <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        in New York that the social systems of Nicaragua and Cuba were of no concern
                        to the US. What is of concern to us, however, is the illegal infiltration
                        elsewhere by both governments. Cuba, by its own admission, has been engaged
                        in this over a long period of time, whereas Nicaragua has initiated this
                        kind of activity against neighboring states more recently. The Secretary
                        thought that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> should be as
                        impressed by this as we, because the concern with regard to Nicaragua was
                        generating pressure towards concerted action which we would support if it
                        develops.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that we have not terminated all assistance to that
                        regime, but we did not understand why it needed 200,000 troops. This was
                        similar to Cuba, which had 50,000 troops in Africa and in the Middle East.
                        We did not believe that this was conducive to international peace and
                        stability, or consistent with <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> norms. The
                        Secretary wanted to repeat that the US was not threatening the character of
                        the government of any state; that was up to the people of each country. But,
                        if illegal means were used, as Nicaragua was doing today, then it does
                        concern us, as it should concern the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary wanted to say a word about Namibia. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had labeled his and the Cuban statements as
                        constructive and had referred <pb n="463" facs="0494" xml:id="pg_463"/>to US
                        support for South Africa and <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">Unita</gloss>. The
                        US is prohibited by law from supporting <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">Unita</gloss> and has not supported what <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had called “bandits.” We have not supported it
                        directly or indirectly, through arms supply or funds, since 1976. Prior to
                        that, the history is clear. <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">Unita</gloss> had as
                        much right to inherit power in Angola as did the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>. It was not a question of legality, but of <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> military support from the outside, including
                        support by Cuba and the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>As for South Africa, both the Soviet Union and Cuba knew that US relations
                        with South Africa were such as to encourage an opening of that society, of
                        eliminating apartheid policies and of engaging South Africa in constructive
                        actions in Southern Africa, including the independence of Namibia. Unlike
                        the previous US Administration, the US had now ascertained that during the
                        past three years the situation had deteriorated and the likelihood of
                        Namibian independence was growing more distant every day. In good faith,
                        therefore, we had tried a new approach, consistent with <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Resolution 435, in concert with the Contact
                            Group,<note n="10" xml:id="d138fn10">Reference is to the Western Contact
                            Group, comprised of Canada, France, West Germany, the United Kingdom,
                            and the United States.</note> the Front Line States,<note n="11" xml:id="d138fn11">Reference is to the Front Line States, comprised of
                            Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, the United Republic of Tanzania, and
                            Zambia.</note>
                        <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> and the South African Government,
                        in moving forward with a three-phased program. In six months we achieved
                        more progress than in the previous four years of failed effort. This
                        progress was becoming increasingly more clear because South Africa can never
                        be forced to withdraw from Namibia in accordance with Resolution 435, unless
                        its legitimate security concerns are taken into account by the Contact Group
                        and the Front Line States. Sometimes conflicting evidence is heard here.</p>
                    <p>When South Africa moved into Angola, we were opposed to this action but did
                        not condemn it because of Soviet involvement. Some Soviet personnel had been
                        captured, others had been killed. There was physical proof in this regard,
                        including documents, plans and statements by captured Soviet personnel
                        indicating heavy Soviet involvement in overall <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> operations. The Secretary would ask if <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> could cite similar evidence
                        regarding US involvement with <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">Unita</gloss>. If
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> could find such evidence,
                        the Secretary would gladly consider it. We know of no such evidence because
                        we do not provide any such support. The Soviet Union could not say the same
                        about <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> interjected that there was no
                        point to this discussion. The Secretary underscored that what he had just
                        said was fully documented—indeed, South Africa had obtained a great deal of
                        evidence. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> insisted that the
                        Soviet Union was helping Angola, not <pb n="464" facs="0495" xml:id="pg_464"/>
                  <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>. The Secretary noted that
                        among other things, Soviet advisors had been encountered with <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> forces and had admitted their presence
                        there for two years.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> asked why the US was
                        protecting South Africa. The Secretary cited the large amounts of Soviet
                        weapons captured by South Africa, which went beyond token quantities and
                        involved large caches, and noted that <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> personnel had been guarding these stocks.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary went on to say that he hoped to clear the air with regard to
                        some of the rhetoric in order that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> understand the picture we have with respect to the
                        Soviet Union and Cuba on this problem. However, we wanted to find a solution
                        to this problem. That was our goal, and it would improve our relations.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had referred to taking
                        small steps on our way back to a more normal relationship. The Secretary
                        thought that it would be a big step if we could achieve peace and stability
                        in Southern Africa. We should disengage super-power competition from this
                        area and let the people in the area find their own solutions. He hoped that
                        the Soviet proposal would arrive at the same reality. However, the Secretary
                        was fully confident that we will succeed with or without Soviet cooperation.
                        We were substantially at the end of the first phase with the Front Line
                        States. We have the agreement of South Africa to the constitutional
                        framework and the enthusiastic support of the Contact Group.</p>
                    <p>In response to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s question
                        about the position of <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>, the
                        Secretary replied that we have received their comments which, along with
                        other comments from Namibia and the Front Line States, were basically very
                        positive. The Secretary wanted to add that we had also been in touch with
                        the Angolan Government, which clearly wants the Cuban troops to depart.
                        Angola wanted peace and help from its neighbors. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> questioned the Secretary’s information and asked who
                        could stop Angola if that was its desire. The Secretary said that he was
                        confident of what he was saying. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> suggested that the Secretary read the Cuban
                        position, which was a fresh presentation of its views.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the real question involved development of
                        simultaneous assurances with regard to Angolan borders and agreed
                        international conditions for resolving the problem of minority rights in
                        Angola. He was referring to tribal considerations, that is, <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">Unita</gloss>. He was confident that this was
                        possible, if the sides were left to their own independent choice. With all
                        the talk about South African withdrawal from Namibia and a separate Cuban
                        withdrawal from Angola, he thought that these circumstances could be
                        provided.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> responded that the Soviet
                        Union was in favor of this, as was evident in the plan he had presented.
                        What <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had told the Secretary
                        was true. The Secretary said that accordingly he was <pb n="465" facs="0496" xml:id="pg_465"/>optimistic that we could solve the problem. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that this was so if we
                        worked in the same direction, that is, if South African aggression against
                        Angola was stopped—aggression which was open, occurring daily for all the
                        world to see—and if Namibia was granted independence. He wanted to emphasize
                        that Namibia should be granted independence in line with the resolutions of
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and without outside interference.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that he had spoken to <persName corresp="#p_SJM_1">Savimbi</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said
                        that he was incredulous why the Secretary had received him, why he had
                        deemed this to be appropriate after the discussions between <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and the Secretary.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that we had to know where <persName corresp="#p_SJM_1">Savimbi</persName> stood and what his position was in order to know
                        whether our proposals were achievable. <persName corresp="#p_SJM_1">Savimbi</persName> clearly was not an ally of South Africa and was not
                        receiving any support from South Africa. He was receiving support from other
                        countries in the region, but not from South Africa or the US.</p>
                    <p>After again registering his disagreement with US recognition of <persName corresp="#p_SJM_1">Savimbi</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> inquired about the process that was envisaged. The
                        Secretary responded that the process involved understanding each other. We
                        were not explicitly linking Cuban withdrawal from Angola with the
                        independence of Namibia; the objective was an empirical outcome. It was
                        necessary to provide for security guarantees for the Angolan Government,
                        which would permit simultaneous withdrawals. The two were not linked, but
                        were empirically related, along the lines of a phased withdrawal of Cuban
                        forces, with physical guarantees for Angola, while Namibia would obtain real
                        independence.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary added that there was a separate question involving Walvis Bay.
                        This involved an independent history, was controversial since the very
                        beginning, and was separate from all the other concerns.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that there should
                        also be agreement with <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that this pertained to whomever was elected. We were
                        not prepared to designate <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> as the
                        government in advance. All sides involved thought that progress was being
                        made. We were finishing the discussions with the Contact Group regarding the
                        first phase and would be reporting about the constituent assembly. At
                        present, work was beginning with regard to the modalities of the second
                        phase. There was a small difference with regard to Resolution 435 and the
                        South African attitude to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> presence,
                        but pressure was being exerted on South Africa and the Secretary thought
                        that this matter could be resolved. At the same time, this question was
                        being discussed with Angola. It was for this reason that we had talked to
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJM_1">Savimbi</persName>, in order to learn his
                        objectives. The Secretary believed that <pb n="466" facs="0497" xml:id="pg_466"/>this was a manageable problem as far as the Angolan
                        Government was concerned, perhaps with the use of some peacekeeping force
                        from the African continent, that is through the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>. We were continuing our work and the Secretary had apprised
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> of our progress. He
                        thought that this would constitute a major assistance to our joint goal.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> replied that if all this were
                        done more directly—and we had addressed this subject with Cuban consent—then
                        the Soviet Union would go along. Of course, much would depend on the US
                        position as well. The Secretary assured <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that we were intent on resolving the problem,
                        thereby letting the nations of Southern Africa determine their own
                        future—keeping the super-power relationship out of Southern Africa.
                        Otherwise, South Africa would commit further aggression and would do it
                        successfully, going deeper and deeper into Angola. The Cuban forces would
                        become more involved and both the Soviet Union and the US would become
                        increasingly concerned. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        responded that neither Cuba nor the Soviet Union wanted this.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that, Angola aside, the problem of Cuba had to be resolved
                        quickly. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> must be aware that
                        this situation was serious and that the President would not stand by and let
                        Castro disturb the peace in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that the Secretary was
                        again returning to the same story. Nothing would shake the Soviet Union in
                        its view that this campaign against Cuba was the result of falsifications
                        and tendentious inventions. Why would Nicaragua, which was not yet standing
                        firmly on its legs, be ramming an alien regime down the throat of others,
                        against their will. This was the same story as with Cuba. The Cubans wanted
                        to live in peace in their own house. Moreover, Cuba wanted good relations
                        with the US, but the US was turning its back.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> asked whether, upon his return
                        to Moscow, he could inform the Soviet leadership and President <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> that the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had concluded that the two sides
                        could act in a common direction with respect to Cuba, Angola, Namibia and
                        South Africa. Could he report that there was agreement between the two
                        countries regarding the way to solve this problem, namely by ensuring the
                        security of Angola and providing for the independence of Namibia. Could he
                        also report that with regard to the question of Cuban forces, the
                        possibility was crystallizing of Soviet-US cooperation in the solution of
                        this question as well? The Secretary said that, on the basis of today’s
                        exchange, he could make such a report.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> expressed the view that we
                        should make use of this possibility, because this was a major issue which
                        required a major effort. We ought to agree that in the event of slight
                        hitches along the way, we would not act like young ladies of a certain age,
                        who lose their temper and display impatience. We should remain calm and <pb n="467" facs="0498" xml:id="pg_467"/>should persevere in working towards
                        implementation of this plan and this objective. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> thought that this would be beneficial to both
                        countries and, generally speaking, for Africa and the world as well. He
                        thought that we could end our discussion on this.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Chemical and Toxic Weapons</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that he wanted to react
                        to something the Secretary had said this morning.<note n="12" xml:id="d138fn12">See <ref target="#d137">Document 137</ref>.</note>
                        First, the Secretary had hinted at some instances of Soviet use of chemical
                        and toxic weapons in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan. In this connection, he
                        wanted to say that it was time to cease spreading false rumors containing
                        allegations to the effect that the Soviet Union either had undertaken some
                        steps involving the use of chemical or toxic weapons, or intended to do so.
                        This was a fabrication from start to finish. It was an invention of
                        Washington, though <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not
                        know who was responsible for this. But then, the situation in Washington was
                        so complex that it was difficult to sort things out. The Soviet Union has
                        not used such weapons, and was categorically opposed to the use of these
                        cursed weapons. There had been discussions regarding their total ban, but an
                        accord was not concluded. What were the reasons? It was the Soviet Union’s
                        impression that when the US had started this rumor involving the Soviet
                        Union, it had concluded that it needed a cover for the production of its own
                        chemical and toxic weapons. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        did not know for how long the US would be able to maintain this position and
                        keep this rumor going. No one in the world believed the US. In Washington
                        people were trying to convince each other. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to repeat that the Soviet Union resolutely
                        condemns anyone who should use chemical or toxic weapons. We should sit down
                        at a table and work out and sign an agreement on banning these weapons. It
                        was the US position which was responsible for failure to complete this work.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was asking the Secretary
                        to tell the President and the entire Cabinet that the Soviet Union did not
                        use chemical or toxic weapons anywhere and did not intend to use them. The
                        Soviet Union had no such intent and was opposed to any country having
                        chemical or toxic weapons in their arsenals. The Soviet Union was for
                        banning these weapons, for negotiating, concluding and signing an agreement
                        to that effect. That was the Soviet position.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he wished to give <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> a prepared fact sheet on this subject.<note n="13" xml:id="d138fn13">Document not found.</note> Surely <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would understand that the Secretary
                        would never make a public statement, as he had, if there had not been
                        overwhelming evidence concerning the facts of the use <pb n="468" facs="0499" xml:id="pg_468"/>of such weapons. We had films, first-hand
                        reports, blood tests and chemical samples, and not just from government
                        sources, but also from independent sources. It was perhaps conceivable that
                        the regimes with which the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> associated
                        might have somehow developed this capability, but there was a very clear tie
                        to Soviet advisors and Soviet military personnel. The Secretary wanted to
                        hand over the fact sheet in order that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> understand that we had facts and evidence.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> replied that as a sign of his
                        indignation regarding this falsified information, he did not wish to take
                        this document. He inquired whether this document had been released. The
                        Secretary said that the fact sheet had been prepared for <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and no one else. The Secretary went
                        on to say that he wanted to reiterate that the information presented to him
                        and to the President was absolutely multi-sourced, that it included films,
                        laboratory tests and independent opinions, not just the opinions of
                        government agencies. Clearly, there was a problem—a problem that would not
                        go away.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Poland</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> now wanted to turn to the
                        matter of Poland. He had no intention of discussing the internal affairs of
                        the Polish people with anyone. Other Soviet officials also had no such
                        intention. However, he did want to say that the Soviet Union was resolutely
                        opposed to interference in Poland and objected to the insinuations emanating
                        from Washington and some other <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        capitals. What has not been attributed to the Soviet Union? Allegations were
                        being made that Soviet troops were massing on the Polish border, that they
                        were about to intervene, that the Soviet Union was already intervening. From
                        time to time the Soviet Union denied these allegations, yet new versions of
                        an alleged Soviet interference in the internal affairs of Poland surfaced
                        again and again. The fact was that the Soviet Union had no intention of
                        interfering in the internal affairs of Poland. Incidentally, the decree on
                        the imposition of martial law was strictly constitutional, and both the
                        Soviet Union and Poland had been saying that this was a national
                        decision.</p>
                    <p>Had the Soviet Union been involved when Poland took the step, it would be
                        impossible to conceal that from history. The Soviet Union as well as Poland
                        had assured the US that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was not
                        involved in that decision. The question arose why was an effort made to
                        accuse the Soviet Union? In the Soviet opinion—and the Secretary would
                        probably not agree—the explanation was that Washington needed to accuse the
                        Soviet Union in order to cover up longstanding US interference. The US was
                        not alone, but the US was playing the first fiddle. Evidently, the US
                        believed that an accusation against the Soviet Union would act as a shock
                        absorber. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> recognized that
                        some Ameri<pb n="469" facs="0500" xml:id="pg_469"/>cans fell for this line,
                        but that was because most Americans read only US statements in US propaganda
                        publications. The US was simply disregarding Soviet statements by failing to
                        publish them. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that this
                        was not merely a reproach, but an accusation against the US Government.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not need to apologize
                        on behalf of the Soviet Union, because the latter was not interfering in the
                        internal affairs of Poland. No one had the right to such interference, which
                        was of a political and economic nature.</p>
                    <p>The new dance—sanctions—is again appearing. In Europe there were provocative
                        radio stations which <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        occasionally had to listen to in the line of his duties, though he could not
                        tolerate such broadcasts for very long. These stations were giving the Poles
                        lessons on how to arrange their affairs. Thus, they were saying that the
                        Poles should turn over one-third of the power to the Church, and another
                        third to Solidarity, or rather the reactionary wing of Solidarity; better
                        yet, they should turn over all power to the latter. Why should Washington be
                        engaged in handing out power, why should it be saying who should receive
                        power and who should lose it?</p>
                    <p>Did the U.S. expect the Soviet Union to interfere in a backward way to turn
                        power over to the Church and Solidarity? That was absolute fantasy. The
                        Poles should be permitted to live and make their own decisions. Of course,
                        like decent people, the Soviet Union wanted to help. If the US wanted to
                        render honest assistance it, too, could do so. The Soviet Union was
                        providing much assistance; the US could do the same, but it acted otherwise,
                        it chose to exacerbate the situation. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not want to discuss Polish affairs, and he would
                        not have addressed the matter if the Secretary had not touched on it.
                        Though, come to think of it, perhaps he would in any case have said, “stop
                        interfering in Polish affairs.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary responded that he saw no useful purpose in debating the issues
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had raised. It would
                        serve a useful purpose if both of us recognized that the Polish situation
                        had now become extremely dangerous for the world at large and for our future
                        relationship. As categorically as <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> insisted that the Soviet Union was not involved, the
                        Secretary also would insist that there was no US interference in Poland and
                        that there could be no such interference.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary did know, however, that our own estimate of the situation was
                        fairly accurate and he thought that it did not depart much from the Soviet
                        estimate, namely that the situation in Poland was deteriorating. This should
                        concern everyone. It was not a matter of meddling in the affairs of the
                        Polish people, it was a matter of a threat to international peace. We had
                        made very clear that we wanted to help. Last year we had provided more than
                        one billion dollars by way of credits and food. The same was true of other
                        Western European <pb n="470" facs="0501" xml:id="pg_470"/>countries. Today
                        Poland is drifting either toward total anarchy or toward violence.</p>
                    <p>We were convinced that the ultimate outcome must be a compromise. Something
                        had to be said publicly on this score because this matter involved all the
                        signatories of the Helsinki Accords which, in their essence, sanctified
                        territorial integrity and noninterference, but also contained fundamental
                        obligations with respect to human rights. The Secretary thought that
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would understand why the
                        strongest forces in the US and in Western Europe with respect to the Polish
                        situation involved unions and working people. The Secretary had looked for
                        some hopeful sign in <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                        comments. Frankly, he had found only propaganda. He was not saying this to
                        add still more propaganda to the discussion, but because this problem was
                        pivotal for the world at large and for the US-Soviet relationship in
                        particular.</p>
                    <p>We were not here to pressure or to preach, but we could suggest that there
                        ought to be some formula that would be perceived by the world at large as
                        suggesting a moderating approach in all of the following three areas: the
                        release of prisoners, the lifting of martial law and the institution of a
                        dialogue. The above suggestions came from Western Europe, and the US agreed
                        with them. He would refer <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> to
                        the statements made in a number of capitals—including Bonn—which mentioned
                        these three conditions. It was the Secretary’s great concern, and it should
                        be <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s concern too, that if
                        this situation was permitted to drift, it would lead to deterioration in
                        terms of the economy and in terms of law and order, and would heighten the
                        strains. He thought that everyone understood the paramount need for safety
                        valves to relieve the pressures generated by the situation in Poland.</p>
                    <p>Our standpoint was that the situation was extremely unsatisfactory, very
                        dangerous, and concerned the entire world, not only Europe or the US, and
                        could lead to a very dire outcome. The Secretary believed that it was in the
                        interest of each of us to seek remedies which would bring Poland back on the
                        road of economic and social recovery. The Secretary had listened carefully
                        to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement that this is
                        what mattered for the Soviet Union. But history belied that. Previously in
                        history the Soviet Union at times had acted in ways which we very much
                        opposed. The Secretary thought that credible, demonstrable moderation was in
                        everyone’s interest; he did not believe this would entail risks that were
                        unacceptable to the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> responded that the Secretary’s
                        information was totally incorrect. The situation was improving and improving
                        quite successfully. No one should hamper this process and the Secretary’s
                        gloomy information was inaccurate.</p>
                    <pb n="471" facs="0502" xml:id="pg_471"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Afghanistan</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to turn to Asia,
                        specifically Afghanistan. The Secretary would recall that during our New
                        York discussion of the situation in and around Afghanistan mention had been
                        made of a possible meeting between US and Soviet experts. The Soviet Union
                        had mentioned this on several occasions, but the US was not interested and
                        thus no meetings had been held. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was not saying this by way of a reproach, for it was
                        the Secretary’s business how he intended to discuss this question and with
                        whom. At this time, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to
                        repeat briefly the Soviet position in case the Secretary was unclear about
                        any parts of it. The Soviet Union had come to Afghanistan to provide
                        assistance against outside aggression. This outside aggression was being
                        committed by individual bands, sometimes numbering ten individuals,
                        sometimes a bit more. Of course, whoever is sending them in is trying to
                        coordinate this activity, but bands are bands. They are engaged in terrorism
                        and were killing peasants, teachers and even school children. They were not
                        active everywhere, only in some provinces. It would seem that those
                        governments which stood behind these bands should recognize that the
                        situation in Afghanistan was irreversible, that the Afghanistan government
                        was firmly in power and would remain so. This was a fact, whether anyone
                        liked it or not. Blood was being spilled needlessly because these bands were
                        treated as they deserved to be treated, that is, they were considered
                        aggressors. Of course, whoever stood behind them did not care about the
                        spilling of Afghan blood. The Soviet Union for its part was, of course,
                        doing its duty and would continue to do so. Accordingly, it would seem that
                        a solution was possible only in one way—by ceasing outside aggression. These
                        bands had to be withdrawn or they had to lay down their arms. All power had
                        to be held by the legal authorities.</p>
                    <p>Internationally, Afghanistan should have a nonaligned status and there ought
                        to be no question on that score, whether on the US side or on the Soviet
                        side. Let it remain nonaligned. If everyone was in favor of that and against
                        spilling blood, against aggression, if everyone favored the independence and
                        nonaligned status of Afghanistan, then this should be formalized. The Soviet
                        Union and Afghanistan saw no other way to achieve this than to hold a
                        meeting between the representatives of Afghanistan and Pakistan, with a view
                        to reaching an understanding on whatever matters were at issue.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union thought that Pakistan was uneasy about its border, for
                        example, there was an area called Baluchistan. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had told the Secretary during their last meeting
                        that a resolution of this matter was possible between the current
                        Afghanistan government and Pakistan. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> believed that this would provide certain benefits to
                        Pakistan, because the latter was concerned about its borders. This <pb n="472" facs="0503" xml:id="pg_472"/>would also be advantageous for
                        Afghanistan, for it would end the shedding of blood. Let there be such a
                        meeting. Why should that be unacceptable to Washington? Why did the US not
                        say a good word in favor of this?</p>
                    <p>As for Pakistan, sometimes it seems to be in favor of such an approach,
                        sometimes it seems to make an about-face, at other times it seems to lack
                        interest. Sometimes the Pakistanis speak of bilateral discussions, sometimes
                        they refuse to engage in discussions without the US friend Iran. But the
                        situation with Iran was at a different level of development. It could
                        participate in such a meeting when the time came, but at this time the main
                        thing was a meeting between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Perhaps this could be
                        accomplished with the assistance of the Secretary General of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> or one of his deputies. It should not be
                        impossible to organize such a meeting. What was diplomacy for? If diplomats
                        could not find a way to set up such a meeting, they should be wrapped up in
                        a package and sent into outer space, beyond our galaxy. Such a meeting could
                        be of a formal or informal nature, it could be governmental or
                        nongovernmental. But if this was done, and if the aggression ceased, then
                        the Soviet troops would be withdrawn. The US did not like the presence of
                        Soviet personnel in Afghanistan, but did the Secretary think that the Soviet
                        Union was happy with this? Soviet forces would stay as long as they have to,
                        they would carry out their duty, but would not stay any longer.</p>
                    <p>If the US was truly in favor of a relaxation of tension, it could use its
                        influence with Pakistan with respect to such a meeting. If this were to
                        occur, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> thought that it would
                        also reduce tensions between India and Pakistan. As for Soviet-Pakistani
                        relations, the Soviet Union had no claims against Pakistan and did not need
                        anything from Pakistan, all it wanted was to develop its relations with that
                        country. Furthermore, this would also be beneficial for the general
                        atmosphere of the entire area, an important area. This would be true not
                        only from the standpoint of the countries in that area, but also, the Soviet
                        Union believed, would serve the interests of the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, as well as other states. This would act
                        as a kind of fresh breath of air, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> hesitated calling it a warm breath. He asked the
                        Secretary to consider all of this. The Soviet Union had gained the
                        impression that the US was not concerned very much about improving the
                        situation. It would almost seem as if the US liked the presence of Soviet
                        personnel there.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said it seemed to him that something had been forgotten between
                        September and now. We had discussed this matter actively in September and
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> had been
                        instructed to discuss the question further in Moscow. But it seems that
                        there was a serious difference on one of the three elements required for a
                        solution. That was the obstacle. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would recall the Secretary saying in Septem<pb n="473" facs="0504" xml:id="pg_473"/>ber that as soon as Soviet troops
                        were withdrawn the present leadership would be finished within a matter of
                        days. The elements discussed included guaranteed borders and a timetable for
                        Soviet troop withdrawal. The third area we discussed was the formula
                        regarding self-determination, that is, the matter of a leadership which
                        could preside over national recovery. Historically, we had no direct and
                        vital interest in Afghanistan, except for its nonaligned status, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> has said the same with
                        respect to the Soviet Union. We had been comfortable with the many years of
                        Afghanistan’s nonalignment. But the Secretary could not but fail to note
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement that the
                        present government was irreversible. The present government would never be
                        able to survive without a Soviet presence. Surely we could imagine a
                        solution to this issue. The US had raised this question with Pakistan after
                        September, but, like us, they view the Kabul regime as an inherent
                        contradiction, which would collapse as soon as Soviet forces were withdrawn.
                        Neither could we condone a circumvention of an accord. The Secretary added
                        that we were not interested in seeing Soviet troops bogged down in
                        Afghanistan. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that he
                        had said that jokingly, in view of US behavior.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we had made a conscious effort to find a solution,
                        but self-determination is an essential factor without which there could be
                        no solution. He wanted to assure <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that we were prepared to deal with this question
                        constructively. We had our own views with regard to Pakistan. On all these
                        questions <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had really
                        confirmed to the Secretary that if some of the fundamental questions were to
                        be resolved, this would facilitate resolution of the specific problems. The
                        US remained prepared to seek solutions to the fundamental questions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s Summary and Bilateral Relations</p>
                    <p>The Secretary had to tell <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that
                        in whatever statement was subsequently made to the press, he would have to
                        say that the Polish question was an overhanging cloud, that this cloud
                        remained and inevitably affected everything we had spoken of. He would also
                        have to say that objectively the reaction to Poland did not involve Poland
                        alone. The Polish situation was seen in the context of Afghanistan, the
                        Soviet arms buildup, as well as Soviet activities and perceptions thereof on
                        the African continent. All of these things over the years made this problem
                        qualitatively different, both in the US and in Europe. He thought that this
                        made the situation of Poland a most serious issue. Therefore, it affected
                        all other solutions and future developments to a greater extent than if this
                        had been an independent problem.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that we had not talked about bilateral relations. He was
                        never satisfied with respect to matters of human rights. He <pb n="474" facs="0505" xml:id="pg_474"/>would note that Jewish emigration had gone
                        down from 50,000 to 10,000, that there were a number of unresolved family
                        reunification cases involving about ten US citizens. A very unsatisfactory
                        situation had developed in our Embassy in Moscow, which was now at a crisis
                        stage, because it seemed that doctors would need to evacuate the people who
                        are starving themselves.</p>

                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that evidently the US
                        position on Afghanistan had not improved, and the US contention that there
                        should be interference in the internal affairs of that country—i.e., with
                        respect to its leadership—was hopeless. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> suggested that the Secretary once again weigh US
                        policies and give some further thought to them. Perhaps he would reach more
                        hopeful conclusions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Near East</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to say a few words
                        about the Near East. Of course, the Secretary knew the Soviet position in
                        that regard. The Soviet side was in favor of Israel vacating all Arab
                        territories. The Soviet Union was also in favor of the independence of
                        Israel and had said this many times as well, specifically to the Israeli
                        Foreign Minister at the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>. The Soviet
                        Union, like a mountain, defended the legitimate rights of the Palestinians,
                        including their right to the creation of an independent, albeit small,
                        Palestinian state, headed by the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>. The
                        Soviet Union had resolutely denounced Camp David which had brought
                        everything to an impasse. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        recognized that the Secretary was trying to paint the prospects in brighter
                        colors, but these prospects were not encouraging.</p>
                    <p>The developments in the Sinai involving the US and other countries, chiefly
                        US allies, were not promising either. With time this would produce a hatred
                        for everyone who brought military units to the Sinai. The Secretary could
                        not be unaware that the Sinai deal was not the last such deal. This area
                        must be genuinely liberated. A genuine solution, including the solution to
                        the Sinai problem, was possible only through a radical resolution of the
                        entire Middle East problem.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to ask why the US had
                        found it necessary to conclude a strategic agreement with Israel. After all,
                        Israel was a US military and political base anyway. Yet the US evidently
                        wanted to demonstrate to the world and to the Arabs that Israel and the US
                        were enemies of the Arabs, and to do so graphically. The Soviet Union viewed
                        this as an anti-Soviet action.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, he wanted to say that the situation had worsened since our
                        last meeting, despite US efforts to sweeten the Middle East situation with
                        sugar. The Soviet Union was in favor of solutions. The <pb n="475" facs="0506" xml:id="pg_475"/>Soviet Union condemned most seriously
                        Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights. If the Secretary was planning to
                        say that the US had been opposed to this, he should not depart with the
                        impression that his argument had been convincing. Israel would not have
                        taken this step without US participation. This annexation of foreign land is
                        aggression, pure and simple. The only thing beyond it would have been open
                        warfare. Thus, emotions were building and the situation was being
                        exacerbated. There has been no explosion yet, but it could come any time.
                        The Soviet Union was not in favor of exacerbating the situation. There was a
                        time in the past when it seemed as if there might be some improvement, but
                        then came “Mr.” Camp David and crushed everything.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, the Soviet Union had a very negative view of the situation. The
                        situation was complex and dangerous and required the attention of the US and
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would welcome it if we could find some joint
                        language on this problem or aspects of this problem. The Soviet Union
                        believed that all countries in this area should be permitted to develop
                        under conditions of peace, and this included Israel. Of course, there were
                        some extremist elements in the Arab World and if there were to appear a
                        front aimed at the annihilation of Israel, the Soviet Union would resolutely
                        oppose this. Yet, Israel did not even have a kind word for the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Humanitarian Issues</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> asked rhetorically what he
                        could say about humanitarian issues. Was it the Soviet Union which had
                        created these problems? Everyone had to honor the laws of their lands.
                        Americans had to observe US laws, while Soviet citizens and everyone who was
                        on Soviet territory had to respect Soviet laws. The Secretary had raised the
                        question with regard to certain individuals who were Soviet citizens. They
                        had to abide by Soviet laws. Here was a minor matter, but the Secretary may
                        have heard, for example, about the case of the Polovchak boy.<note n="14" xml:id="d138fn14">Reference is to Walter Polovchak, who refused to
                            emigrate back to Ukraine with his parents, and who was eventually
                            granted asylum in the United States.</note> The issue arose when he was
                        12, though he was 14 now. He was not permitted to return to his family, he
                        was forced to stay behind. Even when a US court had issued a favorable
                        ruling, the US Secretary of Justice had said that court or no court, the boy
                        would stay. Perhaps the Secretary was too close to the situation. Thus, he
                        suggested that the Secretary take a look at the political clothing of the
                        US. In any event, the matter of human rights was a question that could be
                        discussed, but Washington abuses it.</p>

                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that it would be good if
                        the current Madrid meeting could be brought to a close with some resolution
                        on holding a conference about <gloss target="#t_CBMs_1">CBMs</gloss> and
                        disarmament issues. There was a draft text on the table, which had been
                        proposed by the neutral countries. Even though in the Soviet view this draft
                        required some modifications, the Soviet Union was prepared to discuss it and
                        thought that such a discussion would be useful. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not want to say anything about possible US
                        efforts to complicate this meeting. The Soviet Union was opposed to such an
                        approach. We ought to conclude this session on some positive note. That
                        would be useful and would serve the interests of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the US, and would have a favorable
                        impact upon the situation in Europe. Yet, the US was actively inflamming the
                        situation. Thus, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> suggested
                        that the Secretary take a look at this question in terms of the forthcoming
                        Madrid session. Perhaps, for a change, the meeting could end on a positive
                        note. After all, the only thing involved is the forum for a follow-on
                        meeting. The problems as such would be solved in the forum itself. He
                        thought that we might talk briefly about the need for a future forum without
                        getting into any details in Madrid.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that, considering the views he was hearing from Western
                        Eruope, Madrid would inevitably develop into a platform for expressing
                        concern over Poland. We had studied the draft mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and had found that the first part
                        of it involved a major problem. The others seemed a good deal less
                        troublesome. In any event, we had no fundamental problem with the <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> process, which should continue.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Middle East</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that with respect to the Middle East and value judgments
                        about Camp David, we saw no viable alternative to keeping it in force. We
                        had no other way to ensure Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai. We were
                        continuing to seek solutions pursuant to Camp David because we could not
                        permit ourselves the luxury of not trying. We condemned the Golan
                        annexation, and since Israel did not act in accordance with Resolution
                            242,<note n="15" xml:id="d138fn15">Reference is to the November 1967

                            Arab-Israel hostilities.</note> we look upon this as a non-event which
                        was without standing. The situation was dangerous, especially if Israel
                        should move into Lebanon to clean out the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>. We have restrained them in the past, but if there should
                        be a provocation before an Israeli pull-out from the Sinai, the Secretary
                        thought that Israel might seize <pb n="477" facs="0508" xml:id="pg_477"/>on
                        this quickly, because there was a major proclivity to settle problems by
                        force of arms. Thus, he considered the situation dangerous.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Press Contacts</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that evidently there
                        would be no joint statement regarding our meeting. Did the Secretary expect
                        to make some statement? If so, in what form did he plan to describe or
                        assess this meeting, that is, in what spirit did he plan to do so. The
                        Secretary replied that clearly the Soviet side would be asked whether we had
                        discussed Poland. Frankly, from the Secretary’s standpoint, Poland cast a
                        shadow on our discussions. But he was not looking for a basis for further
                        polemics.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> replied that it would be
                        incredible if the Secretary or his Washington colleagues should refrain from
                        polemics. The Secretary reminded <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that the US had abided very carefully to the agreed
                        line following the New York meeting. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> agreed.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> suggested that we could now
                        terminate our discussion. He thought that this meeting had been necessary
                        and useful and remarked that we had exchanged views on many issues, all of
                        which were important. This exchange was necessary and useful. At the
                        beginning of his summary he would have to say, of course, that at a meeting
                        such as this one a special place should have been assigned to strategic arms
                        limitations, and that for reasons which the Soviet Union could not accept,
                        the US side had found it impossible to discuss this subject even in terms of
                        setting the date for resuming these negotiations. That left an imprint on
                        our relations.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that he had anticipated that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would deal with that subject and he was prepared to
                        do the same. As for <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s summary
                        sheet on INF questions, the Secretary thought that this should not be a
                        topic for discussion with the press. But if <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> intended to discuss it, the Secretary wanted to know
                        ahead of time, because he would have to do the same. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> replied that at this time he had no
                        intention of publicizing it. It would be a different matter if it became
                        necessary to do so in the course of subsequent negotiations. He added that
                        the Soviet delegation would table a corresponding proposal. The Secretary
                        noted that he was pleased with the public relations in general, with respect
                        to INF. He thought that if public relations dealt with the substance, this
                        could be counterproductive.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that he would see how the
                        Secretary and his representatives in Washington reacted to this meeting. Of
                        course, if the need arose to make a special statement regarding our
                        discussions, the Soviet side would certainly do so. Presumably the Secretary
                        would act likewise. He could only say that he hardly expected the Secretary
                        or his colleagues to refrain from making statements. The Secretary said that
                            <pb n="478" facs="0509" xml:id="pg_478"/>he expected to make a statement
                        this evening; this was necessary. But generally he intended to follow the
                        line just discussed. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> remarked
                        that the Secretary would be speaking on his own behalf and if his comments
                        required a response, the Soviet side would provide one. If a response was
                        not necessary, it would not be made. The Secretary noted that it had always
                        been so.</p>

                    <p>(S) The events in Poland have created our best opportunity for derailing the
                        West Siberia to Western Europe national gas pipeline project since this
                        Administration came to office. The Europeans, with the Italians in the lead,
                        are finally awakening to the dangers this project poses for the West’s
                        energy security and the financial bonanza it represents to Moscow. The
                        Soviets themselves have helped to tear the scales from the eyes of the West
                        Europeans by threatening trade reprisals against our Allies if they support
                        our sanctions policy. They singled out the gas pipeline project as a trade
                        benefit and even named West German firms committed to this project in a
                        recent thinly veiled warning.</p>
                    <p>(S) I believe that this is the time to mount a major effort to dismantle the
                        project. The President’s embargo on U.S. oil and gas equipment and
                        technology going to the U.S.S.R. was a major step in this direction. But a
                        policy of denial is not enough. We must also convince the Europeans that we
                        have a strong and positive interest in their energy security. I support
                        Ambassador Rabb’s wise recommendation that we present a cogent, persuasive
                        and economically viable package of alternatives for our Allies to reliance
                        on Soviet energy.</p>
                    <p>(S) We need to move quickly before the lessons of Poland fade from memory.
                        The interagency process has thus far failed to come up <pb n="479" facs="0510" xml:id="pg_479"/>with the necessary package of alternatives.
                        Indeed, this was one of the key European criticisms of <persName corresp="#p_RM_1">Myer Rashish</persName>’s mission to Europe last
                        October. I suggest that your staff take the lead in developing such a
                        package, using detailees from Commerce, Defense, State, and the intelligence
                        agencies. Defense would be willing to provide space and clerical support on
                        a temporary basis.</p>
                    <p>(S) The slowness with which we have responded to the challenge of the West
                        Siberian project and the difficulties we have had in framing an
                        international economic strategy on an interagency basis suggest the need for
                        a more focused approach to such problems. We need to think more creatively
                        about how to correct these shortcomings in our policy development process. I
                        welcome your thoughts in this area, as well as any recommendations as to how
                        we might contribute to a solution.</p>

                        Hunger-striking Pentecostalist.</p>
                    <p>1. (Confidential—entire text.)</p>
                    <p>2. The Acting Secretary telephoned Soviet Charge <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> at 4:00 p.m. January 29 to convey the
                        President’s concern that Lidiya Vashchenko be admitted to a Soviet hospital
                        Saturday morning, January 30. The Acting Secretary explained the background
                        of the case, noting that the latest word received by our Embassy in Moscow
                        was that hospitalization would not be possible until Sunday or Monday. The
                        Acting Secretary stressed our concern for Lidiya’s health and urged that all
                        necessary arrangements be made for her hospitalization as the Embassy had
                        requested. He also reiterated the Embassy’s request that the Embassy doctor
                        and a consular officer accompany her to the hospital and be allowed to visit
                        her frequently, and that she be allowed to return to the Embassy, if she
                        wished, when her health permitted. <pb n="480" facs="0511" xml:id="pg_480"/>
                  <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said he was not
                        informed on the matter but would relay our demarche to Moscow promptly.</p>
                    <p>3. Charge <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> returned the
                        Acting Secretary’s call on Saturday morning, January 30. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said that he had cabled Moscow
                        after talking to the Acting Secretary on Friday, and that “several messages”
                        had been exchanged. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>
                        noted the report of Lidiya’s hospitalization in Moscow,<note n="2" xml:id="d140fn2">In telegram 1220 from Moscow, January 30, <persName corresp="#p_ZW_1">Zimmermann</persName> reported that at 11:55 a.m.
                            Moscow time, a U.S. Embassy vehicle drove Lidia Vashchenko to Botkin
                            Hospital in Moscow. She was escorted by a U.S. consular officer and the
                            U.S. Embassy physician. (Department of State, Central Foreign Policy
                            File, D820053–0493) Later that day, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> wrote in his diary: “The Soviets refused to send
                            an ambulance for the Pentecostal Christian woman on hunger strike in our
                            embassy. She is within hours of death unless she receives medical aid. I
                            ordered her sent to hospital after Soviets refused to let us take her
                            out of Moscow for help. We took her to Moscow hospital in embassy car.”

                        expressed the hope that the Soviet action in the case would be considered as
                        favorably responsive by the American side.</p>

                        taking extraterritoriality decisions, we can delay completion of the
                        pipeline by something close to 3 years. The significance of this is to deny
                        them a significant amount of hard currency after 1986 when they will be
                        running out. No oil exports after 1985. Deficit of $15 billion in 1985 (high
                        estimate) or $6.5 billion (low estimate); $18 billion by 1990.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi> All of these questions ought to be viewed in the
                        light of our Allies, our objectives, etc. The perception of the Allies is
                        that our sanctions hurt them and not us. This is not a partnership. In
                        Poland, the situation is deteriorating and bloodshed is a possibility. In
                        the immediate case, the government is going to continue to squeeze. Nothing
                        so far from the Soviets or from <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Jaruzelski</persName>. Probably nothing <pb n="482" facs="0513" xml:id="pg_482"/>we can do will change their minds. We want to maximize
                        our leverage without risking a confrontation, gain Allied support for strong
                        action. If we use economic/political pressures alone, we can do little. If
                        with allies, we can do a lot. The Soviets are unsure about the situation in
                        Poland—they are surprised at our unity with our Allies. Now they are united
                        in condemning Soviets and joining slowly in sanctions. We must think of any
                        short-term measures only in conjunction with a new package. There is no
                        point in holding off—but economic pressure is important only if we are
                        united with our Allies. It should be reversible if they respond. Credits are
                        the most important single factor of pressure. There should be a sixth option
                        (added to the other five—he then summarizes them). The sixth option is
                        credit. The Allies are moving our way, slowly. We must not take new and
                        jolting actions. By narrow decisions on extraterritoriality, we may destroy
                        our chances to get further Allied actions. Republican Senators are opposed
                        to a grain embargo. We should continue to try to bring our Allies along. If
                        we fail or if the situation changes, we can look at cold turkey steps. We
                        should hit Afghanistan, Libya, the Caribbean. We need a carrot if moderation
                        is restored, a mini-Marshall Plan (by February 9). Polish debt—all agencies
                        except Defense approved the recommendation not to call Poland into default
                        at this time. [N.B. This is not so—the Working Group Report was approved by
                        Defense.] (Notes from Working Group Report.)<note n="2" xml:id="d141fn2">Not

                        default route, we will lose leverage and other countries would be paid

                        Extraterritoriality is absolutely the minimum approach. We would have

                        alternatives to the pipeline. We should keep open the possibility of

                        down the pipeline for 2 years. But it will not be completed until 1987–1990
                        in any case. Any 18 month delay is not going to have any effect. So we lose
                        $500 million in exports for nothing. If the Russians don’t get phosphates
                        from Florida, they’ll get them from Morocco. All the General Counsels agree

                        <item>Status of Interagency Consultations on the Siberian Gas Pipeline and
                            Related Issues</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Mr. Secretary:</p>
                    <p>During the last week, the interested agencies have continued efforts to
                        develop a coherent strategy to deal with the Siberian Gas Pipeline and
                        related issues. Although the <gloss target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss> meeting
                        which I chaired on February 10 revealed continued disarray and disagreement,
                        the latest developments suggest that a new sense of realism regarding our
                        ability to stop the pipeline and the costs of a futile effort to do so is
                        beginning to percolate through the bureaucracy.</p>
                    <p>This is particularly striking in the case of the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Staff, where the action officer<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_BN_1">Norman
                            Bailey</persName>.</note> had previously been pushing for an all-out
                        assault on the pipeline but acknowledged today that he realized that this
                        was the wrong approach. He now feels that the focus of our efforts with the
                        Europeans should be on future credits and imports from the Soviet Union, in
                        other words essentially the point which you have been emphasizing. The
                        Department of Defense continues to insist upon an all-out effort to stop the
                        pipeline. However, the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> action officer
                        has advised us that he plans to discuss the subject with Fred Ikle to see if
                        he can be brought around. I personally doubt that this effort will succeed.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName> appears to share
                        our view, although there are differences within Commerce and you may want to
                        discuss the subject with Mac. <persName corresp="#p_BWE_1">Bill
                            Brock</persName> can probably be counted on to support our position.
                        Treasury also appears to be swinging around to a position compatible with
                        ours. In sum, the bureaucratic environment seems considerably more favorable
                        than I had thought would be the case.</p>
                    <p>Another favorable development is that the pressure for an early <gloss target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                        meeting has dissipated. The <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> action
                        officer has suggested that we have an informal meeting of inter-agency
                            representa<pb n="486" facs="0517" xml:id="pg_486"/>tives in my office on

                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> February 23.</p>
                    <p>1. (S—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. The following report on the highlights of the Secretary’s luncheon with
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> February 23 is made
                        available for your information and on an eyes only basis. You will be aware
                        of its exceptional sensitivity.</p>
                    <p>3. Report follows.</p>
                    <p>4. Begin text.</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that the Soviets had
                        been thinking back on the Secretary’s meetings with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> in Geneva.<note n="2" xml:id="d143fn2">See <ref target="#d137">Documents 137</ref> and <ref target="#d138">138</ref>.</note> He said the Soviets had been
                        prepared to announce the beginning of the <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> talks in those meetings. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had spent a lot of time getting ready for the
                        Southern African issue and had made a clear offer. They have talked
                        privately to the Cubans who are ready to withdraw. There has been no
                        response from the U.S. side.</p>
                    <p>—On Afghanistan <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he was
                        surprised that despite what the Secretary had said in September and what was
                        in the President’s letter to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>, nothing since has happened to get talks started at the
                        expert level.</p>
                    <pb n="487" facs="0518" xml:id="pg_487"/>
                    <p>—The Soviets, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said, had drawn
                        the conclusion that the U.S. doesn’t want the <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> talks. He said the Soviets have therefore decided they
                        had to be prepared to wait this administration out—whether that was 3 years
                        or 7 years. They were obviously dealing with an unfriendly administration in
                        Washington. He said everything the U.S. had done was an insult to them. They
                        would simply have to hunker down and live with it.</p>
                    <p>—The Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> not to
                        attack the President or this administration. It was Soviet actions which had
                        created this administration and the national mood—their actions in
                        Afghanistan, Africa, the Middle East and now on top of it Poland. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked what it was that we wanted
                        in Poland—what was our objective? The Secretary responded that there were
                        two schools of thought. One was that we must seek a lifting of repression on
                        the basis of our three conditions. That after all was the Soviets’
                        obligation from signing the Helsinki agreements.</p>
                    <p>—Another school of thought wants to change the face of the earth and roll
                        back all of the injustices since Yalta. The Soviets should not draw
                        conclusions based on rumors about that point of view.</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> noted that Poland was a
                        vital security interest to the Soviets and we must understand that. The
                        Secretary responded that we too have vital interests in the Western
                        Hemisphere. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that the
                        Soviet’s concern was that if <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Jaruzelski</persName> eases up the pressure, the situation will go back
                        to where it was before and the Soviets will then have to repress even
                        harder. The Secretary said our assessment is unless repression is lifted the
                        Soviets will be faced with a situation in Poland that will blow up.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> replied that the Soviets
                        differ on this assessment but nobody knows for sure. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> agreed that nobody knows for sure but
                        that everything tells us that it will blow.</p>
                    <p>—South Africa: <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked what the
                        U.S. expects of the Soviets in South Africa. The Secretary said we don’t
                        want what you are now doing. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                        denied the Soviets were up to anything and said the problem was that the
                        Front Line states do not agree with the parliamentary system we have pulled
                        together in the contact group. The Soviet Ambassador also said the French
                        agree with the Soviets and were seriously considering pulling out of the
                        Contact Group.</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> then pulled out a <gloss target="#t_TASS_1">TASS</gloss> report of statements by the Nicaraguans
                        and Cubans and noted that the Cubans are ready to negotiate on our
                        hemispheric problems. The Nicaraguans are also anxious to sit down with the
                        U.S. He told the Secretary that these two statements reported today mean
                        what they say and probably even more. He urged us to try them and see what
                        happened. End of text.</p>

                        Chairman <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> on U.S./Soviet
                        Relations and Poland.</p>
                    <p>1. Confidential—Entire text.</p>
                    <p>2. Summary: During a conversation I had with <gloss target="#t_Gosbank_1">Gosbank</gloss> Chairman <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> on February 24, he argued in favor of more
                        U.S./Soviet contact including a summit. He felt that contact between our two
                        countries was essential if only to limit the possibility of mistakes. On
                        Poland, <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> denied that the
                        U.S.S.R. had anything to do with the imposition of martial law which had
                        prevented a civil war and bloodshed. He remarked that the Soviets were
                        telling the Poles that they could not help them endlessly. I told him how
                        Poland, on top of other developments, had dashed the expectations the U.S.
                        had once had in the detente process. Where the West had once shared the
                        Polish burden with the U.S.S.R., now it was the U.S.S.R.’s alone. End
                        summary.</p>
                    <p>3. On February 23, I called on <gloss target="#t_Gosbank_1">Gosbank</gloss>
                        Chairman <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> accompanied by
                            <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZW_1">Zimmermann</persName> and EconCouns <persName corresp="#p_S_1">Semler</persName>. He was cordial and friendly,
                        obviously pleased at my courtesy call. Deputy Chairman Pekshev and Voronin
                        from the Foreign Department were also there. The main subjects we covered
                        were U.S./Soviet relations and Poland.</p>
                    <p>4. U.S./Soviet Relations: <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName>
                        made a plea for high-level meetings, including a summit, as well as more
                        contacts between us. He argued that two great powers should not let
                        themselves be drawn into conflict by the desires of small countries, the
                        number of which increases each year. If our leaders sat down together,
                        “perhaps they would find that these problems in Africa and Latin America”
                        were not all that important. When I asked rhetorically how an Afghan
                        Government could be found which would satisfy the Afghan people, <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> hinted obliquely that a summit
                        might be useful to that end. On our economic relations, he conceded that we
                        could place sanctions on the U.S.S.R. which would have the effect of making
                        the U.S.S.R. work harder, but would also entail loss of contact between our
                        countries. Without contact, the possibility of big mistakes becomes greater.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> was pleased at the
                        results of the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> meeting on which I briefed him in
                        general terms. He had kind words for President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                        <pb n="489" facs="0520" xml:id="pg_489"/>who “he was told” was a good man
                        anxious to do his best for America. In this connection, he noted the belief
                        among Soviets that the President is surrounded by advisers who tell him that
                        the Soviet Union is arming against the United States. <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> added that the thesis was wrong,
                        and the Soviets are probably wrong as well in their characterization of the
                        President’s advisers.</p>
                    <p>5. Poland: I mentioned how the expectations that we had had in the early
                        period of U.S./Soviet detente, when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> had played a prominent role on the Soviet side, had
                        been disappointed, citing Poland. I added that we would not finance the
                        repression in Poland; where the West had once shared the Polish burden with
                        the U.S.S.R., it was now the U.S.S.R.’s alone. In reply, <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> recalled how he and Gosplan
                        Chairman Baybakov had been sent to Warsaw in January 1975 to tell the Poles
                        that their economic policies were leading to disaster, especially the high
                        rate of investment growth. The Poles would not listen. Martial law had
                        prevented a civil war and bloodshed. The Soviets had had nothing to do with
                        the imposition of martial law. <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> conceded that there had been incidents in Gdansk,
                        Poznan and elsewhere, but thought the situation was improving. He argued
                        that if the West cut off credits to Poland, it would suffer more than the
                        East where discipline was being tightened in any case. <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> said that the U.S.S.R. was aiding
                        Poland in the form of energy and raw materials at half the world price, as
                        well as transferable ruble and hard currency credits, but that they were
                        telling the Poles they could not go on endlessly supporting a nation of 35
                        million people. Looking back at the past 18 months, <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> sounded like many other Soviet
                        citizens when he said that the Poles had stopped working during that period.
                        “They want to live like Americans”, he remarked, “but work even less than
                        Russians”.</p>
                    <p>6. Hungary: I raised Hungary as an example of a Socialist economy which
                        seemed to work. <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> agreed but
                        added that economic management was easier in a small country. He thought the
                        Hungarians had struck a good balance between state planning and individual
                        incentives. He asserted that the Soviet Union did not have any monopoly on
                        how best to reconcile common and individual benefits in planned economies
                        “which take much more sophistication than the natural economies of the
                        West”. The U.S.S.R. would welcome any ideas which would improve on the
                        Socialist system although the U.S.S.R. could not accept Yugoslavia’s
                        willingness to tolerate unemployment. (Note: The fine performance of the
                        Hungarian State Bank was highlighted in a Budapest editorial article in
                        “Pravda” on February 22—<gloss target="#t_septel_1">septel</gloss>). Asked
                        about that article, <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> said
                        that <gloss target="#t_Gosbank_1">Gosbank</gloss> follows the same poli<pb n="490" facs="0521" xml:id="pg_490"/>cies. (We read into “Pravda’s”
                        decision to print a eulogy of imaginative Hungarian financial practices
                        something of a backhand criticism at <gloss target="#t_Gosbank_1">Gosbank</gloss> and the Soviet Banking System.)</p>

                        Mr. President, you will have to decide on an interpretation of the sanctions
                        announced on December 29, 1981.<note n="2" xml:id="d145fn2">See <ref target="#d125">Document 125</ref>.</note> It was not <pb n="491" facs="0522" xml:id="pg_491"/>decided at the time whether the embargoed
                        commodities also included products manufactured by foreign subsidiaries and
                        licensees of U.S. firms. This has created a certain amount of confusion,
                        especially in England and France where component parts for the pipeline are
                        being manufactured. The Department of Commerce has had some difficulty with
                        this confusion. Our agenda today calls for discussing the question of
                        including subsidiaries and licensees of U.S. firms and, secondly, the issue
                        of the so-called <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Buckley</persName> Mission to

                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi> As is frequently the case when decisions have to
                        be made quickly—and speed was unavoidable in this case—the decision was
                        clear, but its implications were not. The sanctions on the transfer of
                        technology and the fulfillment of contracts connected with the technology
                        has created a situation where U.S. corporations stand to lose $265 million,
                        but the loss to Europe would be $874 million. The question before us is
                        threefold:</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>1. Are contracts already signed to be included in the sanctions?</p>
                        <p>2. Will the principle of extraterritoriality be enforced?</p>
                        <p>3. Will we insist on applying retroactively those restraints which will
                            cause further financial loss to our Allies?</p>
               </quote>
                    <p>The issue, Mr. President, is not unlike that concerning the default question.
                        Your decision here was correct. European governments are very hesitant to
                        put into effect sanctions which will cause loss of jobs, especially if they
                        involve existing contracts. I have discussed this issue in Madrid with
                        Cheyson. The European tells us that the most painful way of hurting the
                        Soviet Union is by limiting future credits. Our long-term policy should aim
                        toward reversing the flow of hard currency. If the Europeans will cooperate
                        with us in choking off the flow of credits, this would represent a trade-off
                        for our willingness to go easy on signed contracts and on the issue of
                        retroactivity. I am against a high-level mission which would go to Europe
                        with the intention of confronting our Allies and producing the impression
                        that there will be winners and losers. I would rather prefer a low-level
                        mission. Credits are more meaningful in any event. What we are talking about
                        is not the complete cutoff of credits to the Soviet Union, but an
                        incremental <pb n="492" facs="0523" xml:id="pg_492"/>decrease which would
                        force the Russians to borrow at prevailing market rates and thereby pay more
                        for borrowed money. We should establish a mechanism that would supervise all
                        financial deals between East and West. If the credits would go to purchase
                        strategic goods, then no credit should be extended at all; if what is
                        involved are non-strategic purchases, then the Russians should be compelled
                        to borrow at prevailing market rates. For this reason, the Terms of
                        Reference for the proposed <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Buckley</persName>
                        Mission should be modified. If there is a <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Buckley</persName> Mission, it should be downgraded. The pipeline
                        question should not be included in the <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Buckley</persName> Mission. Our pressure in this respect would produce
                        no results and in any way even in this respect control of credit is the most
                        effective impediment. If the pipeline issue becomes a test of European
                        “manhood”, they will reject our pressures.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> I must take the blame for having been
                        careless. At the time that I announced the sanctions, I believed that the
                        United States was the dominant factor in what went into the production of
                        the pipeline. Now, <persName corresp="#p_TM_1">Maggie Thatcher</persName>
                        has made me realize that I have been wrong. I now realize that the important
                        factors are the subsidiaries and licensees of U.S. corporations. Now it
                        seems to me that if we do it at all, we should figure out whether we want to
                        throw a block at the Soviet Union. If we are not prepared to do that, there
                        will be a split between us and American labor. Labor will refuse to load
                        ships. The question is, can we avoid going all the way? Can we avoid telling
                        Europe that our sanctions apply to subsidiaries and licensees?</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>:</hi> I understand Al’s point. Sanctions,
                        however, had a purpose, and to be effective have to be followed through. One
                        cannot tell American corporations: “You cannot, but your son can.” i.e.,
                        General Electric cannot sell the Russians goods, but their subsidiary
                        abroad, under license, may. Hence, we must go for the full reach. Otherwise,
                        we will not appear either as sincere or effective. We do want to stop the
                        pipeline, because of the advantages it gives the Soviet Union in the
                        military sphere—it gives them the capacity to turn off the valves; it also
                        gives them hard currency. The Department of Defense believes that we are
                        able to delay the completion of the pipeline for at least two years by
                        limiting the supply of rotors. To produce these rotors in Europe, it would
                        be necessary to construct a new plant, and this would require two years,
                        during which costs would be rising, and this would give us an additional
                        advantage. Any delay in the construction of the pipeline has great military
                        benefits. I am fully in favor of placing restrictions on the availability of
                        credit, but the European proposals are very limited. They involve five-year
                        loans instead of eight-year loans, raising the interest rates by half a
                        percent, etc. If the so-called <pb n="493" facs="0524" xml:id="pg_493"/>
                  <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Buckley</persName> Mission goes over and
                        talks only about credits, this would demonstrate that we are not willing to
                        stay on course. The loss of jobs is unfortunate—the loss of freedom is
                        worse. I hope also that we can make further attempts to demonstrate to the
                        Europeans the availability of alternate sources of energy. We cannot always
                        modify our policies to adjust to the Europeans. The Department of Defense
                        hopes that the President will adopt that option that calls for the extention
                        of our sanctions to foreign subsidiaries and licensees.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName>:</hi> Two points need to be made. One, there is no
                        way to stop the pipeline. Two, we cannot even delay the pipeline
                        significantly. We talked to experts, and they tell us that at most we can
                        delay it by a very short time. The pipeline will be finished in 1987. It
                        will be a far tougher policy to have <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Buckley</persName> get from the Europeans a framework on credit
                        guarantee restraints. Extraterritoriality is not a practical way to get
                        Europe to cooperate.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName>:</hi>
                        You would then revoke the earlier Presidential resolution on sanctions?</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName>:</hi> No, but I would review it to see where it is
                        effective and where not. We should particularly emphasize credit
                        restraints.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWE_1">Brock</persName>:</hi> I know of no expert who says the pipeline can be
                        completed by 1984. <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName> is
                        correct. They can replace the missing equipment during this period. Our
                        action will not delay completion of the pipeline. The other factor to
                        consider is that extraterritoriality would be a fundamental violation of
                        international agreements. The French certainly would never be allowed to
                        apply extraterritoriality to their firms operating in this country. Britain
                        passed a law through Parliament that would make it impossible for us to
                        extend extraterritoriality to the United Kingdom. The way to deal with the
                        problem is to stop imports from the Soviet Union—these amount to $25
                        billion—and to place restrictions on credit.</p>

                        elsewhere. If the Mission goes to consult, it will not look as if it is
                        backing off if it has no success. Controls on credit will greatly enhance
                        the Soviet problem.</p>

                        This has a real prospect. The Tank Clause and the threat of

                        deal with the Soviet Union last month—that credits were given at eight and a
                        half percent. What the French media criticized was not so much the growing
                        French dependence on Soviet energy, but that French jobs are becoming
                        dependent on the Soviet Union. In other words, that Soviet orders create
                        jobs that make Europeans dependent on the Soviet Union. There is widespread
                        discussion of this in Europe. We should provide leadership in this matter. I
                        don’t know if we can stop the pipeline: this is a technical and a legal
                        question. The issue is: do we wish to make it clear that we would like to

                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>:</hi> We have a major political problem on our hands.
                        It has to be attended to. The Europeans expect us to sit down with them and
                        discuss the matter. They would like us to give them relief from contractual
                        pressures and in return they will give us concessions on credits. The
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Buckley</persName> group should not be a
                        “high-profile” group; it should not be involved in a test of strength; it
                        should not endeavor to kill the pipeline. We all want to apply pressure, but
                        we must get cooperation. Let <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Buckley</persName>

                    <p>The President has determined to defer his decision on applicability of the
                        December 30, 1981, sanctions involving the embargo of oil and gas equipment
                        exports to the Soviet Union pending return of a Mission to Europe headed by
                        Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">James
                            Buckley</persName> to consult with representatives of the Governments of
                        the United Kingdom, France, Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
                    <p>The consultations will address restricting medium- and long-term government
                        and government guaranteed export credits to the Soviet Union and convening a
                        conference of these countries and others to consider the establishment of a
                        standing mechanism for the management of such credit restrictions in the
                        future. Agreement to convene a conference will be subject to concurrence by
                        the governments involved that no new government or government-guaranteed
                        medium- or long-<pb n="496" facs="0527" xml:id="pg_496"/>term credit
                        commitments will be made to the Soviet Union in the interim.</p>
                    <p>In its discussions with European leaders, the Mission should also encourage
                        them to move ahead with further restrictions on non-essential imports from
                        the Soviet Union. The Mission should also encourage the Allied Governments
                        to join with us in an effort to limit European energy dependence on the
                        Soviet Union. However, these latter points should be subordinated to the key
                        objective of significant restraints on credits to the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>In addition to Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Buckley</persName>, the Mission will include representatives from the
                        Departments of Treasury, Defense, Commerce and the National Security Council

                    <p>2. At dinner on March 3, <gloss target="#t_Gosbank_1">Gosbank</gloss>
                        Chairman <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> expanded on themes
                        he had discussed with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> on Feb. 24 (<gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>). In long conversation with Econ Couns <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> said that US and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> were acting like children, letting
                        themselves be led around by the nose by small countries. When Econ Couns
                        cited Afghanistan and Poland as reasons why the American public had become
                        disillusioned with Soviet intentions, <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> said that as far as he was concerned “Afghanistan
                        is a mistake, and we are paying for it.” As for Poland, the Poles do what
                        they want for better or for worse and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> cannot control them. <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> again expressed concern that while President
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> probably understands the
                        real issues of peace <pb n="497" facs="0528" xml:id="pg_497"/>and
                        disarmament, he may be surrounded by advisers who give him bad advice. Again
                        and again, he returned to his main idea which is that Presidents <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> should get together to discuss the issues, and they
                        may well find it possible to make real progress. When Econ Couns suggested
                        that there would need to be careful preparation for such a summit, and at
                        least the prospect of achievement during it, <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> seemed to dismiss both points as of secondary
                        importance: the important thing was for the two leaders to talk to each
                        other. Asked whether he sometimes broached this idea with his colleagues in
                        the Council of Ministers, <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName>
                        said he did and then everyone disagreed with each other. “Probably the same
                        thing happens in Washington,” he added.</p>
                    <p>3. During the evening both <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName>
                        and one of his Deputy Chairmen, Pekshev, separately raised the visit of
                        Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Buckley</persName>, with Econ
                        Couns. They both seemed rather anxious about it. Econ Couns, interrupted
                        both times by other guests, said that he did not know the precise dates of
                        the visit but understood that Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Buckley</persName> was going to listen to the views of Europeans.</p>
                    <p>4. Efforts to obtain information about the Soviet hard currency shortage from
                            <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName>, Pekshev or Foreign
                        Trade Bank Deputy Chairman Nikitkin proved fruitless. <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> changed the subject, Pekshev,
                        despite his position at <gloss target="#t_Gosbank_1">Gosbank</gloss>,
                        disclaimed any knowledge of the subject, and Nikitkin said there was no
                        problem, and promptly launched into a story about three girls on a raft who
                        thought they had a problem. Comment: It is clear that availability of hard
                        currency is not a favorite subject of conversation among Moscow bankers.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_AVS_1">Alkhimov</persName> also had kind words about
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> whom he described
                        as an intelligent, experienced diplomat. He suggested jocularly that
                        Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> should be kept in each other’s
                        capitals and not allowed to return to their homes until relations between
                        the two countries improve.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>I met with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> this morning<note n="2" xml:id="d148fn2">No minutes of this conversation were
                            found.</note> and went over the points you approved for use with him
                        last week. The main topic was Poland, and it struck the sour note in what
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> called an otherwise
                        positive presentation.</p>
                    <p>On Poland, I told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> we want
                        fulfillment of the three conditions needed for the country’s stable
                        development, as the only way to bring it out of its political and economic
                        mess. He said he regretted hearing these “negative things,” since the Soviet
                        assessment of the situation is “better.” He gave no signals that dramatic
                        improvement is in the offing, but did suggest there may be some small steps
                        coming up in the period ahead to show repression is easing. Prisoners will
                        soon be released, he said; there will be no crackdown on the Church; there
                        will be a trade union movement, although it would have to confine itself to
                        work conditions. I said I regretted it was necessary for me to be so firm,
                        but our assessment is that things will get worse unless concrete steps are
                        taken to deal with the situation. Soviet statements are not of themselves
                        adequate.</p>
                    <p>On Afghanistan and Southern Africa, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> challenged some of my individual
                        points—self-determination in Afghanistan and simultaneity of Cuban departure

                        stands in the way.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Over the past several weeks (ever since the introduction of sanctions toward
                        Poland and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>) more and more
                        Europeans are demanding to know what the long-term purpose of our hard-line
                        actions toward the Communist Bloc is. Do we intend to provoke a
                        confrontation? Do we want to isolate the Soviet Bloc? Do we have some other
                        purpose in mind? Or are we being merely impulsive? There is absolutely no
                        hope of securing cooperation for our sanctions from our Allies, who are
                        recalcitrant to follow us anyway, unless our objectives are clearly and
                        persuasively spelled out. And unless such cooperation is forthcoming we will
                        either produce a final split in the Alliance or else have to abandon our
                        current policies, either of which would be a tragedy. The matter was well
                        put by the French Minister of Commerce, <persName corresp="#p_MRH_1">Michel</persName> Jobert, the other day, when he told a group of
                        Americans at the American Enterprise Institute: “You are asking us to go
                        with you on a journey but you are not telling us where you are heading and
                        where we will end up”. (S)</p>
                    <p>It seems to me, therefore, quite imperative that a decision be made on what
                        our long-term policy toward the Communist Bloc is (i.e., what we expect to
                        result from our hard-line policies) and then to make the broad outlines of
                        these objectives public. The first and most critical step can be
                        accomplished through an <gloss target="#t_NSDD_1">NSDD</gloss> on the Soviet
                        Union (there is no PD on the subject to revise, strange as it may seem).
                        Once this <gloss target="#t_NSDD_1">NSDD</gloss> has been approved by the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> and the President, a speech could
                        be drafted: ideally, the President could make a major statement on this
                        subject in the context of his June trip to Europe. Time is of some urgency
                        in this matter. (The <gloss target="#t_NSDD_1">NSDD</gloss> on the Soviet
                        Union could be submitted for <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>

                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Al Haig</persName>’s memorandum (Tab A) calls
                        your attention to a number of events which have occurred in recent weeks
                        that indicate that the struggle for power in the Kremlin among <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s potential successors has begun.
                        Two additional comments may be made:</p>
                    <p>—The succession conflict got underway with the death several weeks ago of
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMA_1">M. Suslov</persName>, the most doctrinaire
                        of Soviet leaders: his death removed the guardian of orthodoxy and the only
                        individual who had enough prestige to keep his Politburo colleagues in
                        line.</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName>, whom <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> has been grooming for his
                        succession, appears to be the most “liberal” among top Soviet leaders in the
                        sense that he has shown genuine appreciation of the significance of the
                        Polish events and has urged the Soviet Communist Party to draw closer to the
                        workers. He also is known to admire the Hungarian economic experiment.

                    <p>The ouster last week of trade union chief Shibayev was the latest sign of
                        intensified pre-succession maneuvering among members of the Politburo.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s protege <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Konstantin Chernenko</persName> seems to be moving to
                        the fore. But the battle has only begun, and it is still far from certain
                        that he will inherit <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                        position as leader of the party.</p>
                    <p>Recent signs of Kremlin infighting have included:</p>
                    <quote>
                     <p>—rumors implicating <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                            son and daughter in corruption and smuggling;</p>
                        <p>—publication of a literary piece (subsequently and without explanation
                            withdrawn from public sale) about an aging man hanging on to
                            power—presumably an allusion to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>;</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> clips that make no attempt to
                            disguise <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s physical
                            deterioration; and</p>
                        <p>—a March 5 rumor of his death (which the Foreign Ministry’s denial
                            attributed to “unsavory sources”).</p>
                  </quote>
                    <p>These jibes at <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> were probably
                        aimed in part at his favorite <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName>’s recent political ascent may already have eased him
                        into the party’s number two spot, which had belonged to the recently
                        deceased ideologue, <persName corresp="#p_SMA_1">Suslov</persName>. This is
                        suggested by <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName>’s:</p>
                    <quote>
                     <p>—presence as the ranking Politburo member at the trade union session
                            which fired Shibayev (March 5);</p>
                        <p>—high profile during <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Jaruzelski</persName>’s
                            visit to Moscow (March 1–2); and</p>
                        <p>—prominence in the media coverage of a February 25 award
                        ceremony.</p>
                  </quote>
                    <p>In addition, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> told a State
                        Department officer on March 3 that <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName> will probably take <persName corresp="#p_SMA_1">Suslov</persName>’s place in running Politburo meetings when <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> vacations in the Crimea.<note n="3" xml:id="d150fn3">A reference to <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> who spoke with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> on March 3.

                    <p>In contrast, <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName>’s rival,
                        Andrey Kirilenko, apparently has been losing ground. He failed to attend the
                        February 25 award ceremony or participate in the talks with <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Jaruzelski</persName>. Moreover, he did not join
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> and six of the
                        Moscow-based Politburo members (including <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName>) at the March 3 performance of a controversial new
                        play about Lenin’s last days. The plot, which highlighted Lenin’s misgivings
                        about Stalin, was implicitly a dig at <persName corresp="#p_KAP_1">Kirilenko</persName>.</p>
                    <p>A key policy issue in the <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KAP_1">Kirilenko</persName>
                        rivalry probably is the allocation of resources. <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName>’s rhetoric suggests a readiness
                        to do somewhat more for the consumer, while <persName corresp="#p_KAP_1">Kirilenko</persName>’s indicates firm support of the military and heavy
                        industry.</p>
                    <p>In spite of his recent gains, <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName>’s narrow power base (he is dependent largely on
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s patronage) casts a
                        shadow over his prospects. <persName corresp="#p_KAP_1">Kirilenko</persName>, having long been the more senior of the two party
                        secretaries, has the advantage of a well-entrenched constituency in the
                        establishment.</p>
                    <p>The outcome at this point remains unclear, but the abrupt increase in open
                        jockeying for position between the principal rivals suggests that the
                        question of who will inherit <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s mantle of power may be more immediate than we had
                        previously estimated.</p>

                    <p>I met with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> late yesterday
                        evening at his request, and he gave me a copy of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s March 15 speech<note n="2" xml:id="d151fn2">See

                                Times</hi>, March 17, 1982, p. A1.</note> and made some points <pb n="503" facs="0534" xml:id="pg_503"/>with reference to the topics we
                        discussed March 3.<note n="3" xml:id="d151fn3">See <ref target="#d148">Document 148</ref>.</note> I let the speech lie on the table; the
                        points were more interesting.</p>
                    <p>He began with the general point that the Soviets agree with us about the
                        importance of reciprocity, restraint and willingness to engage in “joint and
                        parallel efforts” to resolve “pressing international problems”. But he
                        insisted we must move forward simultaneously on various issues and not pick
                        and choose issues critical to only one side, and complained I had left out
                        strategic arms limitation and reduction, the Middle East and continuing the
                        Helsinki process. We have wasted a whole year, he said. I agreed
                        emphatically, and urged the Soviets to stop making trouble close to us,
                        noting we could do the same if we wished. At that point he sweetened and did
                        what he could to demonstrate flexibility on the basically rigid points he
                        had been given.</p>
                    <p>On Poland, he complained about pressure, deadlines and conditions, but then
                        argued that progress is being made in each of the three condition areas and
                        that the Polish leadership intends to go farther, though at a pace only they
                        can decide. I urged release of Walesa and scoffed when he claimed in reply
                        they do not control that decision.</p>
                    <p>On arms control, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> commented
                        only that he could see no chance for progress on INF until it was paired
                        with <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>On Afghanistan he repeated that the Soviets are willing to talk but had
                        nothing new to offer on substance. On Cuba and Southern Africa, he also
                        stuck to Soviet positions “of principle”. On the other hand, with regard to
                        both he claimed the Soviets would not interfere with whatever we can work
                        out (including on the question of arms shipments to Cuba), and on Southern
                        Africa he said the Soviet “understanding” is that a basis for mutual action
                        exists.</p>
                    <p>On balance, this response and <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s evident desire to appear flexible despite a
                        tough-sounding brief leave me not unhopeful. The fact that Poland is an
                        obstacle to good discussion in a variety of areas appears to be sinking even
                        further in, and we should keep talking on selected topics to put their
                        professions of flexibility to the test and thus keep the pressure on.</p>

                     <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName>:</hi> Mr.
                        President, <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Jim Buckley</persName>, having
                        returned from his mission to Europe, will report on the results of his
                        consultations with our Allies on the subject of restricting government and
                        government-guaranteed loans to the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Buckley</persName>:</hi> The
                        purpose of the mission was to show the idiocy of subsidizing the Soviet arms
                        buildup through credits: we wanted to look at credits extended to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in strategic terms, to treat them in the
                        same manner as we do the transfer of sensitive technology. Specifically, we
                        wanted to discuss (1) subsidized credits, offered at <pb n="505" facs="0536" xml:id="pg_505"/>below market rates (sometimes as much as 50 percent
                        below), and (2) government-guaranteed loans. Most countries provide both
                        types of loans: the Germans have a peculiar form of loan insurance known as
                        “Hermes” which is private but has government backing, so it amounts to the
                        same thing.</p>
                    <p>More specifically, the mission wished to accomplish three objectives:</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>1. To consult with the European Allies and Japan on the need for
                            credit restraint and the creation of an appropriate mechanism to achieve
                            this aim.</p>
                        <p>2. “Transparency”: the exchange among ourselves of information on loans;
                            and,</p>
                        <p>3. “Pause”: a moratorium on further credits and credit guarantees until
                            the mechanism to control them has been set in place.</p>
               </quote>
                    <p>We failed in the third objective. The Germans and French said they could not
                        adopt such a moratorium. The Italians said they have already stopped
                        extending credit anyway but for purely economic reasons. We obtained
                        cooperation on “transparency”. The reaction to our first objective, the
                        request for consultations and a “mechanism”, met with a mixed response. It
                        was coolest in Germany where it was said that that country finds it
                        beneficial to extend credit at preferential rates and that “Hermes” is a
                        private organization (although admittedly government-backed). The Germans
                        were also disturbed by the notion of singling out the Soviet Union for
                        discrimination in matters of trade, a practice they described as “hostile”.
                        We stressed that indeed one must single out the Soviet Union—such
                        discrimination is implicit in the maintenance of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and in our defense buildup. (Ambassador Hermes<note n="2" xml:id="d152fn2">Reference is to West German Ambassador to the United
                            States Peter Hermes.</note> of the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>,
                        however, whom I saw today, was more forthcoming.) The French were very
                        French: they were prepared to do away with subsidies but they claimed they
                        could not cooperate in restraining the flow of credits because of a 1981
                        protocol with the Soviet Union committing them to provide the moneys
                        necessary for Soviet purchases in France. We will try to smoke out this
                        accord: we doubt that it exists in this form. The British expressed a
                        willingness to act as “middlemen”. The Italians were a joy: fully willing to
                        cooperate, as long as no country took advantage of the arrangement at the
                        expense of others.</p>
                    <p>The meeting in Brussels was immensely encouraging. We met with the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Council, the EC, and Belgian Foreign
                        Minister Tindemans. The smaller industrial nations are sick and tired of
                        having to compete with larger powers.</p>
                    <pb n="506" facs="0537" xml:id="pg_506"/>
                    <p>In general, one could discern growing Allied concern over East Bloc debts and
                        an understanding that easy money helps the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> solve its critical problems. The idea of doing away with
                        subsidized loans met with sympathy. We stressed President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s sense of urgency: that the
                        President has put the December 30 sanctions on hold until we have reported
                        on our mission. There is also growing congressional impatience. A telling
                        argument was that our ability to cooperate in the matter of the ballooning
                        debt [of the Soviet Bloc] depended entirely on the willingness of the Allies
                        to restrict loans to the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>We laid a groundwork to go forward with bilaterals. We will start these
                        bilaterals with the Germans next week. After the bilaterals there is to be a
                        conference of the leading powers to create a consensus. An agreement should
                        be reached well in advance of the Versailles Summit.</p>
                    <p>The President has also asked us to raise the matter of energy dependence. We
                        did this everywhere. We spoke of North Sea gas, opening the ears of our
                        Allies, especially in Italy and Belgium which are not yet committed to the
                        Soviet pipeline. The Germans may reduce their commitment for Siberian gas by
                        10 percent.</p>

                        delay completion until 1986 (rather than 1984)—any delay based on a 1986
                        deadline therefore has no value. We have gone on this matter as far as we
                        can. It is unfair to the United States—there is plenty of evidence of
                        cheating (e.g., the Japanese backdating of memoranda). No one is going along
                        with us: this is costing many jobs in the U.S. I have no recommendation to
                        make but we should be aware that (1) the Allies are not cooperating with our
                        sanctions, (2) we are losing jobs, and (3) we cannot delay the pipeline.</p>

                        pipeline. Our lever lies in the fact that all East European countries are
                        coming up for review: Poland, Romania, Hungary. The rescheduling of loans,
                        where the Allies want help, can be tied up to their actions <hi rend="italic">vis-a-vis</hi> the Russians. If we get no cooperation in

                        The demand for gas is declining, also in Germany. Our fundamental objective
                        should be to develop energy on our side of the line, not theirs. The Allies
                        ought to commit themselves not to support the second pipeline, to keep the
                        gas takes to a minimum, and to develop resources elsewhere (Norway, etc.).

                        recently had a meeting of some Soviet experts from the universities,
                        including the Wharton School. Their conclusions agreed with the consensus
                        that seems to be forming here.</p>
                    <p>The Norwegian Government wanted to delay the exploitation of its substantial
                        gas reserves until the 1990s because of the energy glut. However, the new
                        Norwegian Government is different from the old one which opposed large-scale
                        economic development. Let us move away from trying to tamper with
                        contractual agreements [on the Siberian gas line]. The Europeans are
                        beginning to feel we are crazy. This takes attention away from the really
                        important issue: the second pipeline and the substitution for it of
                        Norwegian energy, which would give good business to U.S. firms.</p>
                    <p>On extraterritoriality, I agree with <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName>: European subsidiaries and licensees must fulfill
                        their contracts. This does not hurt us. But there was an agreement that
                        there would be no undercutting and this is being circumvented (for instance
                        by Komatsu which backdates trade agreements).</p>
                    <p>I also agree with <persName corresp="#p_CWJ_1">Bill Casey</persName>: trying
                        to stop the pipeline is a secondary objective which irritates Europe. Keep
                        this issue dangling. The same applies to the default.</p>

                    <p>The academic experts on the Soviet Union said that the U.S. is beginning to
                        acquire a reputation for economic warfare against the Soviet Union. This
                        would be disaster when Eastern Europe is drifting away, when we should want

                    <p>The Director lunched with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> on 1 April 1982, at a Washington restaurant.
                            <persName corresp="#p_REV_1">Rostow</persName> was returning <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s hospitality on an earlier
                        occasion. The tone was relaxed and cordial.</p>
                    <p>After the conversation had covered most of the topics mentioned in the
                        enclosed list of talking points,<note n="2" xml:id="d153fn2">Not
                            attached.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_REV_1">Rostow</persName> gave <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> a copy, which he read attentively
                        and put in his pocket.</p>
                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> expressed a personal
                        interest in the possibility of a joint Soviet American approach to the ICRC
                        for some sort of study or enquiry into the charges of Soviet use of chemical
                        and biological weapons in Asia. He thought <persName corresp="#p_REV_1">Rostow</persName> should develop a more detailed plan, which <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> would then discuss with <persName corresp="#p_REV_1">Rostow</persName> and send on to Moscow. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> thought we should not mention the
                        Cuban Missile Crisis precedent, which would be irritating in Moscow.
                        Meanwhile, certain questions occurred to him. What would be the relation of
                        such a group to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> body? Would a Soviet
                        and an American scientist be on the panel? How big would it be? <persName corresp="#p_REV_1">Rostow</persName> undertook to prepare a more
                        concrete proposal and come back with it shortly.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> expressed a positive view
                        of our suggestion that the next round of the INF talks would have to tackle
                        the problem of data and the achievement of an agreed data base, as
                        comprehensive as possible. He made no objections of principle, and seemed to
                        indicate that Soviet thinking was along the same lines. He had pressed hard
                        on the importance of the British and French systems to the “unsophisticated”
                        Soviet members of the Politburo, who could not understand why those systems
                        were not part of the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> arsenal.
                            <persName corresp="#p_REV_1">Rostow</persName> countered by recalling
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NPH_1">Nitze</persName>’s presentation at
                        Geneva of the six Soviet errors on the subject of the British and French
                        systems. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that while, as
                        a chess player, he appreciated the elegance of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NPH_1">Nitze</persName>’s arguments, the plain, simple men
                        of the Politburo were not impressed by such reasoning. If we could only
                        solve this problem, he was sure many other problems could be solved. With
                        all our wonder<pb n="511" facs="0542" xml:id="pg_511"/>ful experts about
                        Soviet life available to us, why weren’t we more sensitive to the nature of
                        the Russian temperament? (He sounded this theme with variations a number of
                        times during the lunch, evoking a touching picture of staunch, sturdy,
                        rather angry Russian peasant-patriots.) <persName corresp="#p_REV_1">Rostow</persName> replied that if we could reach agreement on the
                        figures, so that we were not confronting a different method of calculation
                        every time we turned around, it might be possible to see the British-French
                        problem and many other issues in a more realistic perspective.</p>
                    <p>3. On <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> seemed satisfied with the indications in the
                        President’s statement<note n="3" xml:id="d153fn3">On March 31, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> opened his news conference with
                            a statement calling for “an agreement on strategic nuclear weapons that
                            reduces the risk of war, lowers the level of armaments, and enhances
                            global security.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>

                        of account and the linkage to the evolution of events in Poland. On the unit
                        of account, he asked about the accuracy of the <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> story,<note n="4" xml:id="d153fn4">Reference is to David
                            M. Alpern, et al., “A New Outcry Over Nukes,” <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi>, March 29, 1982, p. 18.</note> and seemed comfortable
                        with all its implications, as had been the case in their talk several months
                        earlier. <persName corresp="#p_REV_1">Rostow</persName> reported to him his
                        conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Kvitsinskiy</persName> about
                        the “<persName corresp="#p_NPH_1">Nitze</persName>” as a way of measuring
                        the destructive power of nuclear weapons. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> wondered helpfully, “why not a <persName corresp="#p_REV_1">Rostow</persName>?” On political linkage, he said
                        that some people in Moscow bristled at the idea of linking the course of
                        events in Poland to <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>. Poland was an
                        internal problem. <persName corresp="#p_REV_1">Rostow</persName> replied
                        that this was not a matter for irritation or anger. In his speech before the
                            <gloss target="#t_CD_1">CD</gloss> in Geneva, <persName corresp="#p_REV_1">Rostow</persName> had listed a number of factors
                        making the course of events in Poland a matter of international concern.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> had made a
                        constructive proposal for initiating a peaceful resolution of the crisis in
                        December—a proposal that fully respected the legitimate security interests
                        of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe. Those ideas should be addressed soon
                        seriously and without anger.</p>
                    <p>4. The conversation did not go far on verification, because of the passage of
                        time, but <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> did note that his
                        assurances to <persName corresp="#p_REV_1">Rostow</persName> at their
                        previous lunch were not “private” but official.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">SUMMARY</p>
                    <p>We are now at the threshold of announcing the beginning of <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, without commensurate Soviet actions to
                        address our geopolitical concerns. Our national priorities and general
                        policy approach are in place, but they have not yet produced the kind of
                        Soviet restraint we can point to and follow up on to validate them. The
                        initial regional/arms control balance of our approach to the U.S.-Soviet
                        relationship is therefore at risk, and there is an inescapable agenda with
                        the Soviets: if we do not drive events, there will be events that can drive
                        us. We have the choice between: (1) proceeding case-by-case on the basis of
                        our national priorities and present approach, hoping they will produce
                        results on regional issues to balance the start of <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>; and (2) seeking to force events at a
                        pace and in the sequence which would maintain the integrity of our approach,
                        but without guarantees of success. I favor the latter course, and a game
                        plan with an initial focus this spring on geopolitical issues built around
                        our action <pb n="513" facs="0544" xml:id="pg_513"/>program in Central
                        America and early commencement of U.S.-Soviet experts’ talks on Afghanistan,
                        to be made public in the same time frame as the <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> announcement. Subsequently, in late spring and summer we
                        would add a supplementary focus on further arms control and bilateral
                        relations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">THE STRUCTURE OF THE ISSUES</p>
                    <p>As between running in place and moving forward in a sequence of our choosing,
                        we need to decide on the course most likely to preserve the credibility and
                        effectiveness of the Administration’s overall approach to relations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">THE BALANCED APPROACH AT THE CROSSROADS</p>
                    <p>We spent the first year establishing a coherent and rational approach and
                        explaining it patiently and consistently to the Soviets, our Allies and
                        friends, and the U.S. public.</p>
                    <p>That approach is based on the requirement that the Soviets show real
                        restraint and accept reciprocity not just in the area they would prefer—arms
                        control and “European security”—but in three areas of vital concern to U.S.
                        interests—geopolitical issues, including but extending far beyond Poland;
                        security and arms control overall; and bilateral relations.</p>
                    <p>We have jarred the Soviets from the disdain toward us they had fallen into
                        over the past decade, without provoking them to radical new testing and
                        challenging initiatives. But if they have been jarred, they have not been
                        moved. They have not responded directly to sanctions nor driven bilateral
                        relations further downhill, but they continue to arm-wrestle us for the
                        propaganda high ground in arms control, and they continue to sustain or
                        escalate the kind of egregious behavior in regional situations which
                        destroyed the “detente” they are still nostalgic for. Except in very
                        tentative fashion, e.g., in Southern Africa, we have not yet been able to
                        create the new realities that will force them to move, and show that our
                        approach is working.</p>
                    <p>The outlook for the next six months is not bright. It includes continuing
                        domestic and international economic difficulties; continuing uncertainty
                        over the fate of your economic and rearmament programs; resurgent opposition
                        to INF deployments in Europe; tension and instability without clear
                        direction in Poland; and mounting crisis and domestic hostility to U.S.
                        involvement in Central America. And in this vexed situation, increasing
                        public and Congressional concerns about nuclear weapons and the need to make
                        the June summits successful will give new impetus to arms control
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, the Soviet
                        leadership continues to hope that our economic stringencies and
                        Transatlantic dissension will drive <pb n="514" facs="0545" xml:id="pg_514"/>us back willy-nilly toward a version of “detente” without the need for
                        basic adjustments from them. Our first-year approach to the Soviets has been
                        firm and tough, but necessarily rhetorical. There has been little in it that
                        allows them to conclude that our new approach is anything but a cover for a
                        new Cold War, to which they must react appropriately. At the same time,
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> may be failing, and in
                        any event leadership maneuvering for the succession rose a notch with the
                        death of <persName corresp="#p_SMA_1">Suslov</persName>. This makes it
                        correspondingly important that we offer potential successors a plausible
                        alternative to a neo-Stalinist retrenchment based on East-West
                        confrontation, belt-tightening, and autarky. Although we cannot determine
                        the outcome, we will influence it in a constructive direction only if we
                        demonstrate convincingly that we are genuinely prepared to develop relations
                        on the new basis we have defined.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">THE SIX-MONTH AGENDA</p>
                    <p>And, meanwhile, the calendar of events on our present agenda with the Soviets
                        is inescapable over the next six months. Issues must be dealt with in every
                        area of the relationship.</p>
                    <p>—Among geopolitical concerns, Poland will be only one of a number of trouble
                        spots. The others will certainly include Latin America and Afghanistan, and
                        could well include Pakistan, Iran, and Lebanon.</p>
                    <p>—The grains issue is both geopolitical (as a potential Poland sanction) and
                        bilateral. The extended year of the U.S.-Soviet Long-Term Agreement (<gloss target="#t_LTA_1">LTA</gloss>) expires September 30. The question of
                        further extension must be faced in the context of Poland sanctions, a record
                        grain harvest, rising world stocks, falling prices, Congressional elections,
                        and a Farm Bill which raises questions about the value of an <gloss target="#t_LTA_1">LTA</gloss> as a foreign policy instrument.</p>
                    <p>—We must manage at least three strictly bilateral issues. (1) Human
                        rights/emigration issues will inevitably take on a higher profile this year,
                        beginning with the Pentecostalists, but very much including Jewish
                        emigration. (2) On cooperative activities, we must decide on a short fuse
                        whether or not to renew a fisheries agreement with the Soviets that has
                        important advantages for West Coast fishermen and support from West Coast
                        Congressmen, and we will face a series of similar decisions regarding
                        activities clearly beneficial to the U.S. under agreements we have decided
                        not to renew because of Poland. (3) There is also the question of whether to
                        recommence the process of opening consulates in Kiev and New York, frozen by
                        a misguided <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> Administration
                        sanction for Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>—In arms control, we are obliged to move on <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> by early summer, whether or not we can show results in
                        other areas of the relationship.</p>
                    <pb n="515" facs="0546" xml:id="pg_515"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">ANOTHER GRAND DESIGN?</p>
                    <p>We have a choice between running in place and moving forward, but in either
                        case we should proceed on the basis of the balance between regional concerns
                        and arms control that we have defined this past year. If we choose any other
                        basis at this point, before we can show results, the likelihood that we will
                        sacrifice the credibility of our whole policy is almost overwhelming.</p>
                    <p>In the context of Poland sanctions and preparations for the June Summits, we
                        can expect to hear calls for light at the end of the tunnel on arms control
                        and European security as a tradeoff for European responsiveness to our
                        leadership on Poland. While intellectually appealing, in practical terms the
                        concept would require a rapid and radical departure from the
                        Administration’s whole policy approach up to now, onto the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s chosen ground. Our carrots with the
                        Soviets are essentially in the political field, and if we offer them up in
                        Europe before the Soviets have begun tangibly to exercise new restraint
                        outside Europe, we will be moving, and probably irreversibly, from our
                        agenda to theirs.</p>
                    <p>We should by all means seek to sell moves we make in the framework of our
                        current approach to the Europeans as “light at the end of the tunnel.” But
                        the current approach is based on solid and accurate analysis of what has
                        gone wrong with East-West relations this last decade, and what is needed to
                        put them right. We will not be doing either ourselves or the Europeans or in
                        the long term the Soviets any favors if we jettison that approach for
                        short-term Transatlantic gain. Our objective must be to control the pace of
                        developments so as to maintain the integrity of our approach, and thus our
                        leadership credibility. That means making sure that when we move in one area
                        we can point to as much Soviet movement as possible on our key regional
                        concerns. As we see it, there are only two realistic options.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">ANALYSIS OF OPTIONS</p>
                    <p>Basically, we can deal with the agenda on a case-by-case basis within the
                        context of our priorities and general approach, in the hope that our
                        leverage on the Soviets will grow with time, or we can seek to force results
                        in areas of our choosing which show some promise, and in the sequence most
                        likely to keep our overall approach intact.</p>
                    <p>Case-by-case steadiness has many advantages. In particular, it would avoid
                        the political risks of taking any new initiatives with Moscow which the
                        other option would entail, and put off the day when we would have to decide
                        what if any credit to give the Soviets for responsiveness on their part.</p>
                    <p>Simple steadiness also has multiple disadvantages, however. With honorable
                        exceptions our approach has been necessarily but primarily <pb n="516" facs="0547" xml:id="pg_516"/>reactive in this first year, basically a
                        “talk-and-talk” mode, and continuation would leave most of the initiative to
                        the Soviets. And in terms of their perceptions this has two major if
                        alternative possible defects. On the one hand, it would consolidate Soviet
                        hopes that our bark is worse than our bite, and that our economic and
                        Transatlantic difficulties will chivy us back toward “detente” without
                        substantial concessions from them. On the other hand, failing to test the
                        seriousness of Soviet signals on geopolitical issues could consolidate the
                        conviction in some quarters in Moscow that we are not serious ourselves
                        about the need for regional restraint, that we are really driving for
                        “superiority,” and that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> must take
                        radical steps to defend its interests.</p>
                    <p>Result-oriented activism would require us to identify areas where the results
                        we want—restraint and reciprocity—are most likely to be achievable over the
                        next half year, and to make the hard decisions to go after them with the
                        Soviets.</p>
                    <p>This option differs from “talk-and-talk” in that it would require more
                        positive action and more initiative from us in selected areas on both the
                        pressure and negotiation tracks. To some extent it reverses the pros and
                        cons of the other option. But it would also give the Soviet leadership the
                        test of our real intentions needed to avoid both complacency and dangerous
                        alarmism as the succession proceeds.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, as a higher-risk approach the option is also demanding in
                        specific ways. The element of strong action it requires—diplomatic,
                        economic, but also possibly military—will frighten our Allies and sectors of
                        our public. And the Soviets can be counted on to fan this fear, and seek to
                        perch even higher on their preferred (and undeserved) high ground as
                        defenders of peace and the political status quo against American adventurism
                        and willingness to destroy the status quo. If we choose to pursue this
                        approach seriously, therefore, we will need to establish ourselves as the
                        real defenders of peaceful change within a flexible, internationally
                        acceptable framework of law and comity. Practically, this means we may
                        suspend agreements and activities, but should not abrogate them; that we
                        should defend the Helsinki Final Act and the Helsinki process, and not
                        denounce them; and that we should denounce Soviet violations of postwar
                        agreements but not the agreements themselves. If the structure of
                        international relations within which peaceful change must take place is
                        damaged or torn down, it must be the Soviets who are—and who are seen to
                        be—responsible, rather than the United States.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">ELEMENTS OF A GAME PLAN</p>
                    <p>I favor an activist approach and a game plan for action in all three areas of
                        the relationship. The initial primary focus is on geopolitical issues,
                        followed quickly by an overlapping additional focus on arms control and
                        bilateral issues coming on line this summer.</p>
                    <pb n="517" facs="0548" xml:id="pg_517"/>
                    <p>If the game plan is moderately successful in its elements and in its
                        sequence, we will have laid the basis for proceeding toward a bilateral
                        summit with our approach and credibility intact. At this point, committing
                        ourselves to a summit would be disastrously premature, since it would bring
                        with it a rush for “results” without any sound policy basis for real
                        results. Most likely it would confirm the Soviet insistence that arms
                        control is “central” and geopolitical worries are “secondary.” We might
                        begin to introduce the <hi rend="italic">idea</hi> of a summit into our
                        private discussions with the Soviets, as an added “carrot” for results on
                        our geopolitical concerns. But we must be careful to avoid loose summit talk
                        propelling us toward either the “Spirit of Geneva”<note n="3" xml:id="d154fn3">Reference is to the so-called Big Four Summit at the
                            Geneva Summit in July 1955.</note>—euphoria without results—or the
                        “Spirit of Glassboro”<note n="4" xml:id="d154fn4">Reference is to the
                            Glassboro Summit in June 1967.</note>—sourness without results.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Public Leadership</hi>. As a capstone and anchor for the
                        regional/arms control balance during this difficult period, in our public
                        declarations both you and I should register the critical importance of
                        progress on both elements for the constructive East-West relations we seek.
                        Your May speech, in other words, should give due weight to geopolitical
                        issues, alongside arms control; I plan to do the same when I talk.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Regional Issues</hi>. Over the next three months we should
                        focus primarily on this area, beginning with Central America/Caribbean and
                        Afghanistan. We should resist linkage among regional issues, since it leads
                        too easily to spheres of influence, and we should be able to do so
                        successfully, on the basis of our main message that the U.S. will create new
                        realities by solving regional problems in their own terms.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Afghanistan</hi>. In the wake of Afghanistan Day it is
                        important to keep attention focussed on this issue, and I propose to move
                        forward on the bilateral “experts’ talks” we have been discussing with the
                        Soviets since October in the same timeframe as the <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> beginning announcement. We would
                        consult carefully beforehand with the Pakistanis, key European Allies and
                        the Chinese, and we would let the news that the experts’ talks are beginning
                        become public in a way that does not make Afghanistan primarily a
                        U.S.-Soviet issue, since the Pakistanis and the non-aligned/Islamic
                        countries should remain out front. We will also make sure we control the
                        agenda and public perceptions of what we are doing. By putting out the news
                        in the same timeframe as the <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>
                        announcement, we will have given tangible form to the critical policy point
                        that geopolitical issues and arms control are equally central in our
                        approach to the Soviets.</p>
                    <pb n="518" facs="0549" xml:id="pg_518"/>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Cuba in Central America</hi>. You will recall that when
                        Phase I of our Central America game plan was before you, I insisted on how
                        important it was for you to look down the road at the implications, up to
                        and including Phase III. It remains as important today as it was then. We
                        have set in train a process that is potentially explosive, and the policy
                        stakes are very high. The Soviets will not take us seriously in general
                        unless we can follow through at every step in Central America. The covert
                        action program currently underway will raise the political temperature in
                        the area to new levels over the next month. In itself it is unlikely to
                        accomplish much, however. Thereafter I see several possible development
                        tracks:</p>
                    <p>—In response to Nicaraguan fear, the Cubans could feel impelled to become
                        more heavily involved in Nicaragua, and ship in MIGs, more advisors, or even
                        whole military units. If that happens and we stand back, it will be a major
                        foreign policy disaster: we must be prepared to react, and react
                        strenuously.</p>
                    <p>—If, on the other hand, the Nicaraguans emerge unified from this test and
                        feel they can manage on their own, there will not be much change on the
                        ground. We will still suffer policy damage, but so long as the Cubans do not
                        become more directly involved, there is a chance of success for our policy
                        over the long haul, provided we remain involved in El Salvador, continue our
                        multilateral efforts, and keep public support for staying the course.</p>
                    <p>—Whatever development track emerges, we must face the fact that if our
                        negotiating scenario should fail, as it well might, we need to be prepared
                        for the tougher, higher-risk alternative of moving against the Cubans in
                        more dramatic ways, including military action. Once it is apparent that our
                        basic credibility is at stake, we may have no other option consonant with
                        the national interest.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Poland</hi>. In our public approach and in international
                        fora, we should refocus attention on the real terms of this regional
                        problem: it is the Soviets and Polish military who have made it more
                        dangerous and intractable, and who have the responsibility to put the
                        country on a less dangerous course. Our responsibility is to combine
                        pressure and inducements for them to do so. Hence, we should take care to
                        keep open the option of further sanctions even as we make clear that we are
                        prepared to reverse sanctions and make a major contribution to Polish
                        economic recovery together with our Allies, once the Polish regime has
                        committed itself to real fulfillment of the conditions we have defined. The
                        destruction of Poland’s trade with the West in the wake of sanctions is our
                        major lever for a moderate course. It works both ways: to go beyond talk of
                        debt default would hurt us more than it hurts the Poles and Soviets, but
                        discussing it keeps the issue alive as pressure, and could lead us easily
                        into discussion of debt rescheduling—an inducement—if conditions
                        warrant.</p>

                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Southern Africa</hi>. Here we should continue to test
                        the meaning of Soviet “proposals” on behalf of Cuba while proceeding apace
                        with our action track, the Namibia/Angola negotiations. In its own way, the
                        Soviet approach resembles our approach to Afghanistan, and we should be wary
                        of linkage. Our objective should be to secure Soviet agreement not to block
                        the peace process, but also to keep the Soviets out of it until we have a
                        settlement in hand.</p>
                    <p>During the late spring and early summer, we should add an additional focus on
                        arms control and bilateral issues.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Security/Arms Control</hi>. The Soviet “peace offensive”
                        and our own pressures and interests all point to the need for early forward
                        movement beyond our current firm but low-key approach to arms control. We
                        should accept this, and make it our objective to control the process within
                        our overall policy approach. Hence the initial focus on Central America and
                        Afghanistan, as balance-wheels for arms control movement. But we should also
                        engage now in intensified internal preparations on both arms control and
                        bilateral relations.</p>

                        and to counter the “peace offensive,” we should aim to announce a starting

                        opens. Decisions will be needed primarily in the June–September period.</p>

                        this point I am inclined toward simple extension for another year on the
                        same basis (6 mmt. minimum, 8 mmt. maximum without consultations). As the
                        optics will be unfavorable in <pb n="520" facs="0551" xml:id="pg_520"/>Western Europe, the state of play on Poland-related measures will be an
                        important variable regarding timing.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Cooperative Activities</hi>. We are moving to renew our
                        fisheries agreement with the Soviets, but only for one year. It must be
                        submitted to Congress by April 30 if it is not to lapse, and we must
                        therefore propose this solution quickly to the Soviets. It would preserve
                        the advantages our fishermen enjoy under the joint venture provided for by
                        the agreement and signal our commitment to structures, but it would also
                        signal to the Soviets that they are on a short leash until relations
                        improve. The dilemma is typical of bilateral cooperative activities in
                        general, and there will be at least one more test case this summer:</p>
                    <p>—Our review of activities under the sanctions program is concluding that a
                        strong case can be made that the Space Agreement whose termination was
                        announced December 29 is on balance strongly advantageous, in terms of
                        benefit to programs and scientists, to the U.S. In its way, the sanction is
                        as misguided as its <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>
                        Administration analogue, the Kiev Consulate. If conditions in Poland permit,
                        we should make it the first concrete example of reversibility of sanctions
                        against the Soviets, and negotiate extension of the agreement.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Kiev and New York Consulates</hi>. There is a strong
                        case for reversing a wrongheaded <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> sanction (especially as we commence experts’ talks
                        with the Soviets on Afghanistan) and restarting the process leading to
                        establishment of a U.S. official presence in the heart of the Ukraine. The
                        Soviets are pressing us to fish or cut bait on a fine Kiev consulate
                        building they have prepared for us but we have neither occupied nor made
                        payments on. But there is a downside. The intelligence community is lukewarm
                        in its support for our establishing in Kiev. The <gloss target="#t_FBI_1">FBI</gloss> was resigned to opening in New York before, but now is
                        opposed to an additional Soviet presence there. We will draw some political
                        heat in any event by a decision to move forward on an Afghanistan sanction,
                        much less after Poland. After considering the pros and cons, I would propose
                        to risk the building by telling the Soviets we would like to keep it, but
                        are not in a position to move forward to negotiations on reopening now.</p>

                    <p>Preliminary comments on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s Memorandum “U.S.-Soviet Relations Over the Near Term”
                        (April 2, 1982).</p>
                    <p>The basic theme of this memorandum is that the growing foreign and domestic
                        pressures for US-Soviet strategic arms negotiations before the Soviet Union
                        has shown restraint in its activities around the globe place at risk our
                        policy of linking these two actions. The Secretary states that there are two
                        options before us in meeting this challenge. We can either deal with our
                        geopolitical disagreements with the Soviet Union case by case, in the hope
                        that somehow this will produce enough positive results to compensate
                            for<note n="5" xml:id="d155fn5">A handwritten note in the left margin
                            next to “compensate for” reads: “justify commencing?”</note>
                        <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>. Or we can force the pace of events
                        that would preserve our policy by giving us (of course, without any
                        guarantee of success) enough so that we can enter <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> talks without losing face. He himself favors the latter
                        approach, urging commencement of negotiations (at the “expert” level) over
                        Afghanistan <pb n="522" facs="0553" xml:id="pg_522"/>and some tough actions
                        in the Caribbean to precede announcement and initiation of <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> negotiations in June of this year.</p>
                    <p>Without going into details of the Secretary’s proposals (most of which
                        impress me as sound and realistic) let me raise a fundamental question about
                        the premise which underpins it: that there must be linkage between Soviet
                        restraint globally and progress on arms control. I believe that this
                        approach is <hi rend="italic">basically faulty</hi> and if pursued further
                        will land us in the kind of trouble this memorandum addresses itself to,
                        only more so. Only by <hi rend="italic">decoupling arms control from Soviet
                            global actions</hi> can we avoid alternative consequences, both of them
                        unfavorable: either being forced to capitulate on our demand for Soviet
                        restraint, or else engaging in adventures to prove that we are not
                        capitulating but the success of which, by the Secretary’s own admission,
                        cannot be guaranteed.</p>
                    <p>The point is that the nuclear competition and the emotionalism to which it
                        gives rise is unlike any regional, geopolitical issue: it is <hi rend="italic">sui generis</hi>. People in the free world are so afraid
                        of the arms race and the risk of nuclear war that they are not prepared to
                        stand up to the Russians on any regional issue—be it Afghanistan, Poland, or
                        Central America—if such resistance seems to enhance the danger of nuclear
                        war. Given this fact, our policy places us at a great disadvantage because
                        the Soviets can always neutralize a public outcry over their actions with a
                        campaign that to resist them risks ultimate destruction of mankind.</p>
                    <p>It so happens that the public, both here and in Europe, believes
                        (unrealistically, in my opinion) that the mere act of negotiating arms
                        limitations or reductions between the “superpowers” attenuates the arms race
                        and reduces the risk of nuclear war. Given this perception it will not do to
                        say: we are not prepared to negotiate with Moscow on matters of such
                        paramount importance until it satisfies us on matters of secondary
                        importance in selected regions of the globe. This is a losing position. What
                        we ought to do is to say: “Of course, deceleration of the arms race is so
                        supreme an objective that we are prepared to negotiate it at any time, any
                        place even though our adversary behaves in an utterly uncivilized manner.”
                        This will go far toward defusing the public pressures and allow us to cope
                        with the Russians on geopolitical matters at a time and place of our own
                        choosing rather than in order to “prove” that we can enter <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> negotiations without having sacrificed
                        our principles. To induce Moscow to behave globally, we should use economic,
                        political, and scientific levers which can be very effective but do not

                    <p>The Soviet Government engages in negotiations not in order to promote a
                        peaceful and stable world order or to improve the lot of its people but in
                        order to derive some concrete political, military or economic benefits for
                        itself. Moscow always likes to negotiate with the West because it feels it
                        enjoys immense advantages over us in two respects:</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>1. The Soviet Government has far greater continuity than ours and
                            therefore a greater store of expertise in international affairs (one
                            only has to consider that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                            has been involved in diplomacy continuously for some 40 years).</p>
                        <p>2. Negotiations arouse expectations in free societies which enables
                            Moscow, by influencing Western opinion, to exert pressure on their
                            opposite numbers for concessions. (S)</p>
               </quote>
                    <p>Moscow is most likely to negotiate seriously when it feels weak: either when
                        it is behind us, or we are behind it and making good <pb n="524" facs="0555" xml:id="pg_524"/>progress catching up. Its readiness to engage in
                        effective bargaining is highest when there <hi rend="italic">is a succession
                            crisis</hi> in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> because, since
                        there is no legal way of one administration taking over from its
                        predecessor, the death or removal of a leader unsettles the whole system of
                        administration and requires a breathing spell in foreign relations. (S)</p>
                    <p>We should get ready to negotiate a number of outstanding issues with Moscow
                        as soon as <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> leaves office.
                        This calls for us preparing our positions well in advance so that we are not
                        caught by events and are forced to improvise, responding to Soviet
                        initiatives instead of confronting them with ours. Our positions should deal
                        with specifics and not generalities, i.e., they should aim at concrete,
                        mutually advantageous <hi rend="italic">quid pro quos</hi> rather than at
                        grandiose attempts to settle affairs of the world between us. As the new
                        Soviet administration attempts to establish itself it is likely to be more
                        agreeable to making concessions than at any time since the death of Stalin.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>The current economic and imperial crisis of the Soviet regime, acute though
                        it is, does not offer good opportunities for negotiations. The Soviet regime
                        has never made political concessions out of economic considerations: it has
                        made political concessions only to meet its political needs. (S)</p>

                        provide us with leverage in the event any further sanctions are

                        with the Soviet Union case by case, in the hope that this policy will
                        somehow yield enough positive results to allow us to proceed with <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> without loss of face. Or else, we can
                        force the pace of events by undertaking actions that will (hopefully) give
                        us enough returns to enter <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> on our
                        terms. Al favors the second option, urging the opening of negotiations (at
                        the so-called “expert” level) with the Soviets over Afghanistan and some
                        tough actions in the Caribbean to precede the anticipated initiation of
                            <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> early in the summer. (S)</p>
                    <p>Much of what Al says is eminently sound but valid questions can be raised
                        about the basic premise of his approach, namely that progress on arms
                        control negotiations must be linked to Soviet global behavior. Two basic
                        arguments can be raised against this approach:</p>
                    <p>—The nuclear competition between the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> gives rise to an emotionalism which is quite unlike that
                        aroused by any regional issues (Afghanistan or Poland, for example).
                        Citizens of the free world are so frightened of the arms race and the threat
                        of nuclear war that they are unwilling to stand up to the Soviets on
                        regional issues if such resistance seems to exacerbate the risks of nuclear
                        competition and general war.</p>
                    <p>—Aware of this situation (which it does not confront within its own realm)
                        the Soviet Union is able to intensify international regional <pb n="528" facs="0559" xml:id="pg_528"/>conflicts at its pleasure and then blame
                        the United States for failure to negotiate arms control. (S)</p>
                    <p>The linkage principle places us in a no-win situation. Under its terms, we
                        are compelled either to capitulate on our demand for Soviet global
                        restraint, or else to engage in adventures and/or dubious negotiations on
                        regional issues (e.g., Afghanistan) in order to prove that we are not
                        capitulating. (S)</p>
                    <p>The best way out of this unfavorable situation is to <hi rend="italic">decouple nuclear arms negotiations from regional issues</hi>, exactly
                        as we have done in the case of INF talks in Geneva. Public opinion in the
                        West tends to believe—realistically or not is another matter—that the mere
                        act of negotiating arms limitations between the so-called “superpowers”
                        restrains the arms race and reduces the risk of nuclear war. We should,
                        therefore, not say: “We are not prepared to negotiate with Moscow on a
                        matter of such overriding importance until it satisfies us on disagreements
                        of secondary importance in selected regions of the globe”. Our position
                        should rather be: “Of course, slowing down the nuclear arms race and the
                        risk of an holocaust is an issue of such gravity that we are prepared to sit
                        down and talk with the Soviets about these matters despite the fact that
                        they behave in an utterly uncivilized manner all over the globe. Our delay
                        so far has been caused by the need to define our position. This work has now
                        been completed and we invite the Soviet Government to meet with us and
                        discuss seriously strategic arms reductions.” (S)</p>
                    <p>Such a position will go far toward taking steam out of public pressures here
                        and abroad for an automatic “freeze” and “no first use” declaration. It will
                        also enable us to cope with Russian regional challenges at times and places
                        of our own choosing rather than in order to “prove” that we can enter <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> negotiations without having sacrificed
                        our principles. To induce Moscow to behave regionally, we can have resort to
                        the economic and political levers at our disposal: these can be very
                        effective and yet are not subject to massive public opinion campaigns.

                     <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> made the invitation during an

                            428–431.</note> raises the question of whether a more formal invitation
                        should be extended through diplomatic channels. Moscow’s extremely cautious
                        public and private response to your offer of a meeting suggests that the
                        Soviets were caught off guard, and that it may be difficult to pin them down
                        unless we extend <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> a direct
                        invitation. Putting your invitation in diplomatic channels would also
                        underscore its seriousness and insulate us against possible Soviet efforts
                        to question the sincerity of your offer.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, there are a number of good reasons why a formal letter from
                        you to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> would not be the most
                        effective means of extending the invitation. If, as seems likely, the fact
                        of your letter to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> became
                        public knowledge, it would inevitably complicate our efforts to manage
                        domestic and allied expectations. Intense speculation about a possible
                        meeting between you and <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        might detract from our effort to keep the immediate focus on your trip to
                        Europe and participation in the Versailles and Bonn Summits. A direct letter
                        from you to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> might be viewed
                        by the Soviets as an effort to humiliate him and take advantage of Soviet
                        leadership uncertainties by personalizing an invitation that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> might find it physically difficult
                        to accept.</p>
                    <p>We might minimize some of these disadvantages if I called in <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> to underscore the seriousness of
                        your invitation and put it on the diplomatic record more formally. The
                        groundwork for such a meeting has already been laid in a recent conversation
                        between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> and
                        Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d161fn3">

                        a meeting could not be limited to arms control, and would cover the entire
                        range of U.S.-Soviet issues, including Poland, Afghanistan, the Caribbean,
                        and human rights. I could also suggest to <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that, should <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> not be able to accept the invitation, an

                        informal, Soviet response to your invitation in order to make the necessary

                            <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> on the possibility of a U.S.-Soviet summit
                        reflects Soviet perceptions that President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s proposal for a meeting on the margins of SSOD–II
                        posed a challenge both to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                        health and to Soviet policy. The Soviet counterproposal of an October
                        meeting in a neutral European capital meets both challenges: It casts a vote
                        of confidence in <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s health
                        and longev<pb n="532" facs="0563" xml:id="pg_532"/>ity, and puts the summit
                        ball back in the American court. In a meeting April 19 with the Ambassador,
                        candidate Politburo member Demichev mentioned in passing that it was not so
                        important <pb n="533" facs="0564" xml:id="pg_533"/>whether a summit took
                        place in June or in October; what was important was that it should take
                        place. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. One of the key purposes of the <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> statement was to dash domestic and foreign
                        speculation on the Soviet leader’s health and on his viability as a
                        functioning leader. The <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> “interview” was
                        printed on the front page of all central newspapers, and, judging by the
                        Soviet media handling of past <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> “interviews,”
                        will be carried on the front page of all local newspapers as well. The
                        suggested October meeting date is sufficiently distant as to commit the
                        Soviets to very little, but at the same time conveys the expectation that
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> will be on the job for
                        the foreseeable future. The fact that the Soviets have suggested a European
                        site for the summit, however, will be read by Soviets as an implicit
                        acknowledgement that the old man is not up to a transatlantic journey.</p>
                    <p>4. Speculation on <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s health
                        has been rampant since the Soviet leader fell ill on March 25. Over the past
                        weekend, rumors were circulating among Soviets all over Moscow that
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had died. A number of
                        Soviet sources recounting this rumor to <gloss target="#t_EmbOff_1">Emboffs</gloss> voiced the possibility that news of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s death is being withheld. One
                        Soviet citizen told us on Saturday that he and several of his friends were
                        expecting the Sunday papers to report <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s death. We are still hearing rumors of his death
                        today, despite the summit counterproposal. This climate forms an important
                        backdrop not only to the <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        interview, but also to <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName>’s
                        remarks in Sochi (reported ref) and to the April 15 press conference staged
                        to deny rumors of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s failing
                        health.</p>
                    <p>5. Another key purpose of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                        proposal of a summit this fall in a European neutral capital was to put the
                        propaganda ball back in the American court. By repeating his 1981
                        proposal—voiced at the 26th Party Congress—for a Soviet-American summit,
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> claims priority for the
                        idea for the Soviet side. Furthermore, he renews the challenge to the U.S.
                        to join in a high-level dialogue which Soviet propaganda all along has
                        claimed we are avoiding. The statement contains thinly veiled criticism of
                        the way President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> broached
                        the subject in his White House press briefing. The <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> interviewer notes that the President’s remarks on the
                        subject evoked “contradictory commentaries.” <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> agrees, saying that <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s remarks left a “rather diffused impression,”
                        whereas his own statement is “completely clear and definite.”</p>
                    <p>6. In a meeting April 19 with the Ambassador, candidate Politburo member
                        Demichev mentioned in passing that it was not so important whether a summit
                        took place in June or in October; what was important was that it should take
                        place. Comment: That Demichev, in a private conversation, should emphasize
                        the importance of a summit’s taking place irrespective of the date contrasts
                        with the public media emphasis on October rather than June. This variance is
                        an additional indication that the public mention of October has the ulterior
                        purpose of reassuring readers that Leonid Il’Yich will still be around six
                        months from now. End comment.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Recent reporting indicates that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>,
                        East Germany, and Czechoslovakia are considering measures that would
                        restructure some aspects of their foreign aid to the Third World, as well as
                        trade with the industrial West. The policy deliberations can be linked to
                        these nations’ growing shortages of hard currency—an outgrowth of Poland’s
                        financial crisis—and to the declining growth in their domestic
                        economies.</p>
                    <p>Last December, an official of the 10th Directorate (Foreign Military
                        Assistance) of the General Staff of the Soviet Ministry of Defense reported
                        that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s military aid programs were
                        coming under pressure from the ailing Soviet economy and from needs of the
                        armed forces. Consequently, the overall number of Soviet military advisers
                        and instructors abroad might be reduced.</p>
                    <p>Since January, we have seen similar reports regarding a possible change in
                        East Germany’s aid and trade policies. In response to economic problems,
                        including a growing trade deficit, the East German Government is considering
                        a 30-percent reduction in its technical assistance personnel in Ethiopia; a
                        cutback in imports of Western components needed for East Germany’s military
                        research and development program; and a redirection of trade from
                        financially strapped Third World nations to those capable of paying with
                        hard currency, important energy sources, or raw materials.</p>
                    <p>Czechoslovakia clearly considered a similar change in its foreign policy.
                        Last September, the Czechoslovak Party Presidium endorsed a decision to
                        reduce aid to Third World nations, a measure designed to alleviate the
                        nation’s financial problems.</p>
                    <p>
                     <gloss target="#t_DIA_1">DIA</gloss> COMMENT: We believe these reports
                        accurately reflect the seriousness of the Soviet and East European hard
                        currency situation, <pb n="535" facs="0566" xml:id="pg_535"/>characterized
                        by fewer available Western credits and a diminished ability to generate hard
                        currency earnings.</p>
                    <p>Poland’s financial crisis has exacerbated Eastern Europe’s hard currency
                        problems in two ways. First, the specter of a Polish default has made the
                        West less willing to extend credit to other East European countries. Second,
                        shortfalls in Polish deliveries of coal and other goods have forced several
                        East European nations to purchase additional supplies from the West, thereby
                        adding to their hard-currency indebtedness.</p>
                    <p>Overall economic malaise in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and
                        Eastern Europe is another factor aggravating the region’s financial
                        problems. In the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, consecutive crop
                        failures and the need to import record amounts of food have severly strained
                        the Soviet hard currency position. In Eastern Europe, falling productivity
                        has limited the flow of saleable commodities to the West, making Western
                        imports required for industrial expansion difficult to finance.</p>
                    <p>These financial difficulties are likely to persist. Thus, we expect the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern Europe to continue to
                        reassess foreign aid with the Third World and trade with the West in an
                        effort to alleviate their faltering hard currency positions.</p>

                  <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> noted that the questionable
                        state of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s health may have
                        influenced the Soviet counterproposal of an October summit to President
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s offer to meet with
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> if the latter attends
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>’s Special Session on Disarmament in
                        June. The desire to one-up the President may have been uppermost in the
                        Soviets’ calculation. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                        offer is now under study; our response will be determined by events and the
                        character of our dialogue in the coming period.</p>
                    <p>Preparations are now in full swing for the President’s trip to Europe which
                        will include the Bonn and Versailles summits with our Allies. One of the
                        US’s main goals is to limit subsidized credits and official guarantees to
                        the Soviet Union. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Buckley</persName> has been deeply engaged in this effort which had
                        recently taken him to Europe again. We hope to have achieved a unified
                        position on this issue before the President’s trip to Europe in June.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the various geopolitical problems which plague US-Soviet
                        relations, <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> said that we have
                        seen no evidence that the Soviets have softened their positions but that we
                        will continue to probe their intentions.</p>
                    <p>Regarding Poland, we are now waiting to see how <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Jaruzelski</persName> carries through on a pledge to release a
                        “significant number” of detainees by the end of April. The Poles have also
                        stated their intention to lift some aspects of martial law, including the
                        curfew, by that same date. We have sought to ascertain from the Poles what
                        the future role of Solidarity and in particular Lech Walesa will be and have
                        made clear the importance Americans attach to these questions. We have
                        received no indication of what those plans are; perhaps the Poles themselves
                        don’t know how to handle this problem.</p>
                    <p>In Afghanistan, the Soviets have increased their troop levels to around
                        95,000 and their spring offensive against the opposition is underway. We
                        have seen no movement on the part of the Soviets to seek a negotiated
                        settlement although we have made clear that we will not acquiesce to their
                        continued occupation. Afghanistan Day and our recently released report on
                        Soviet use of chemical and biological warfare<note n="2" xml:id="d164fn2">Reference is to <hi rend="italic">Chemical Warfare in Southeast Asia

                        have helped to keep public pressure on the Soviets. Diego Cordovez, the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary General’s special
                        representative on Afghanistan, recently completed a trip to the area. It is
                        doubtful that he made much headway. The US remains opposed to any efforts
                        which would lend the Babrak regime legitimacy.</p>

                    <p>Turning to bilateral issues, <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName>
                        reported that we had recently responded to a Soviet query on our intentions
                        with regard to the property held for us in Kiev. While we will continue to
                        retain several apartments in the city, the state of our relations would not
                        allow us to sign an agreement which would preserve our rights to a major
                        office and residential complex. Although the Soviets have suggested that we
                        may lose our rights to the complex, we are prepared to live with that
                        possibility.</p>
                    <p>In line with our policy of preserving cooperative programs with the Soviets
                        with clear benefit to the US, we have notified the Soviets of our decision
                        to extend for one year without modification the Governing International
                        Fisheries Agreement (GIFA). We also advised them of the deletion of two
                        ports (Seattle and Honolulu) to which they have access under the agreement.
                        We are prepared to discuss alternative ports with them but they have not yet
                        suggested any.</p>
                    <p>In the arms control field, we are now in the final stages of our interagency
                        review of <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>. We hope talks may begin
                        this summer. The INF talks are now in recess until May.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> concluded his remarks with a
                        reference to the Soviet treatment of the Falkland Islands dispute which he
                        termed unhelpful and opportunistic. Although President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> had clearly advised the Soviets to
                        “butt out” we suspect they are busy figuring out how to “butt in”.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">US Human Rights Policy</p>
                    <p>Assistant Secretary for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs <persName corresp="#p_AE_1">Elliott Abrams</persName> described our human rights
                        policy under the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                        Administration. We are more interested in actual results than in speeches
                        which merely sound good. Tactically, we prefer quiet diplomacy in those
                        areas where we have some diplomatic clout and are achieving a measure of
                        success. The Administration is also concerned that publicity could result in
                        the destabilizing of regimes whose successors could prove to have worse
                        human rights records. El Salvador is a clear case in point; Vietnam and Iran
                        serve as past examples. If quiet diplomacy fails, then we can employ overt
                        tactics such as votes in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and
                        international banking institutions and the denial of bilateral military and
                        economic assistance.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_AE_1">Abrams</persName> posed the question of how we
                        can be most effective in influencing the human rights behavior of the Soviet
                        Union. Since we obviously do not have the diplomatic leverage which we
                        possess in such countries as the Philippines or Korea, we must rely more on
                        public discourse. Our public criticism serves two parallel purposes. One
                        extrinsic effect is to underscore for other countries the contrast between
                        East and West. For example, little in Europe is known of the more unsavory
                        aspects of Castro’s regime in Cuba. We can expect to <pb n="538" facs="0569" xml:id="pg_538"/>have an effect within the Soviet Union as well since
                        the Soviets are sensitive to public opinion and particularly to European
                        opinion. The Soviet decision to allow the emigration of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName>’s daughter-in-law, Lisa
                        Alekseyeva, is a case in point. Although the Soviets did not respond to
                        private approaches, public demonstrations on her behalf had the desired
                        effect.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_AE_1">Abrams</persName> stressed his conviction that a
                        moral component of US foreign policy is an inescapable fact of American
                        politics. While we have no illusions about our ability to change Soviet or
                        other societies, our political goal is to help those individuals, whether
                        religious or political dissenters, who seek to establish an island outside
                        of government control.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_AE_1">Abrams</persName> advised exchange visitors to
                        make their human rights concerns known to their Soviet hosts. They could do
                        this most effectively by arguing that exchanges with the Soviet Union cannot
                        be insulated from political relations and that the US, and in particular the
                        scientific community, will have to draw away from exchange programs in the
                        face of human rights abuses. He felt that we should encourage all those
                        involved in exchange programs to meet with dissidents in the Soviet Union
                        although an obvious concern would be to avoid placing either American or
                        Soviet participants in danger.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Exchanges</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> noted that all
                        representatives had received a copy of the review of the bilateral exchange
                        agreements which had been undertaken after the imposition of martial law in
                        Poland. Our conclusion was that the level and content of exchange activity
                        are appropriate to the current state of US-Soviet relations. The review,
                        including <gloss target="#t_COMEX_1">COMEX</gloss>’s contribution indicates
                        that the exchanges have provided significant benefit to the US. He urged
                        that all representatives study the document and provide any comments to the
                        Office of Soviet Affairs (Hurwitz).</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> reported that the Soviets had
                        recently reversed their longstanding position on the bilateral agriculture
                        agreement by signalling their willingness to resume activity under the
                        agreement which they had previously refused to do in the absence of a
                        high-level Joint Committee Meeting (prohibited by us as a post-Afghanistan
                        sanction). The State Department is now working with <gloss target="#t_USDA_1">USDA</gloss> on how to respond to the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_SJD_1">Scanlan</persName> confirmed that we will be
                        sending a note to the Soviets informing them of our non-renewal of the
                        Energy Agreement. The return of the US magnet provided in the context of the
                        Magnetohydrodynamics (<gloss target="#t_MHD_1">MHD</gloss>) program is a
                        separate issue which we are discussing with the Department of Energy.
                        Metzler (<gloss target="#t_DOE_1">DOE</gloss>) noted that the future of the

                        <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I am writing to address a question of critical importance to our two
                        countries and to the world—negotiations to reduce the threat <pb n="540" facs="0571" xml:id="pg_540"/>of nuclear war and the burden of nuclear
                        armaments. It is entirely appropriate that this question has been one of the
                        central issues in the U.S.-Soviet relationship throughout the post-war
                        period. Indeed, the awesome destructive power of nuclear weapons imposes on
                        our two countries both the practical necessity and the moral imperative to
                        do everything in our power to reduce and even eliminate the possibility of
                        their use in war. This has been the thrust of my country’s approach to
                        nuclear arms control negotiations over the past thirty-five years.</p>
                    <p>As we look back over almost three decades of U.S.-Soviet negotiations on
                        nuclear arms control, we can identify a number of notable achievements, such
                        as the Limited Test Ban Treaty, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and
                        the <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> Treaty. These agreements have laid
                        the basis for new efforts in the nuclear arms control process. We can take
                        considerable inspiration from the statesmanship of leaders in both
                        countries, which made these agreements possible. At the same time, we must
                        also recognize that certain international events, such as the invasions of
                        Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan, have undermined prospects for reductions of
                        nuclear arms.</p>
                    <p>We now stand at another historic juncture in the effort to reduce the threat
                        of nuclear war and the burden of nuclear armaments. One of the highest
                        priorities of my Administration has been to undertake a thorough review of
                        these issues in order to ensure that our approach to the problem of
                        strategic arms reductions is fair, equitable, and understandable to the
                        American people. We have proceeded deliberately to avoid the mistakes of the
                        past. We are now prepared to move forward. Therefore, I propose that
                        U.S.-Soviet negotiations on reductions of nuclear arms begin in Geneva by
                        the end of June, and that we immediately begin exchanges in diplomatic
                        channels to fix an exact date.</p>
                    <p>Our objective in the negotiations will be substantially to reduce the numbers
                        and destructive potential of strategic nuclear weapons, in the framework of
                        equal and verifiable limitations on both sides. As you know, it is my view
                        that our previous efforts at limiting strategic offensive arms did not
                        adequately meet the standards of reductions, equality, and verifiability. I
                        am particularly concerned by the failure of previous agreements sufficiently
                        to limit the deployment of those systems that, because of their capability
                        to destroy the other side’s land-based systems, heighten the risk of nuclear
                        war. An important task in <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> must be
                        to address more effectively the problem of these destabilizing systems.</p>
                    <p>In pointing out these deficiencies, I do not mean to suggest that there is
                        nothing positive that can be learned from previous <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreements. It does mean, however, that we must go well
                        beyond those efforts in <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>. If we set
                        our sights too low, we will fail to make a meaningful contribution to the
                        goals of enhancing strategic stability <pb n="541" facs="0572" xml:id="pg_541"/>and reducing the risk of nuclear war. In such
                        circumstances, it will be difficult to obtain the support of the American
                        people and Congress for a new strategic arms agreement. We owe it to both
                        our peoples, and to the World at large, to do better.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the goals set forth above provide a positive and constructive
                        basis for progress in the forthcoming negotiations. At the same time, the
                        lessons of the past teach us that the arms control process cannot be
                        insulated from the overall state of relations between our two countries and
                        the international atmosphere in general. This is a reality of political
                        life.</p>
                    <p>Our two countries have begun a dialogue on a number of sensitive regional
                        problems. What is now needed, if we are to move toward resolution of these
                        problems, is concrete action on the part of the Soviet Union indicating that
                        it is prepared to exercise restraint. Only in this way can an environment
                        conducive to progress on strategic arms reductions be created and
                        sustained.</p>
                    <p>In closing, I would like to reiterate that my Administration has no higher
                        priority than reducing the threat of war. I will personally spare no effort
                        to achieve this objective, and I hope that I can count on a similar personal
                        commitment from you. Nothing less will meet the obligations imposed upon us
                        by the responsibilities of leadership in the nuclear age.<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2">In telegram 5621 from Moscow, May 8, <persName corresp="#p_ZW_1">Zimmermann</persName> reported that he had

                    <p>1. (Secret)—Entire text.</p>
                    <p>2. Summary: Secretary called in <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> May 7 to inform him of President’s intention to
                        begin <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> negotiations, as well as to
                        clarify our position on an eventual summit. Secretary balanced the current
                        focus on <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> by stressing the
                        geopolitical issues on which we seek Soviet restraint—Afghanistan, Poland,
                        Falkland Islands, and Southern Africa. Secretary also informed <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> of great concern of administration
                        and American people over decreased level of Soviet Jewish emigration, noting
                        that emigration and situation of Soviet Jewry were critical to overall
                        U.S.-Soviet relationship. At the end of the meeting, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> raised two bilateral issues: Joint
                        fishing agreement and consulates. Copy of Secretary’s talking points being
                        pouched to Embassy. Highlights of meeting given below. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> and Summit: Secretary outlined
                        the contents of the President’s letter to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> on <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>,<note n="2" xml:id="d167fn2">See <ref target="#d166">Document
                            166</ref>.</note> that Embassy Moscow would deliver it in Moscow on the
                        President’s behalf. Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> we would be in touch shortly regarding the
                        modalities for commencing <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>
                        negotiations. On the summit issue, Secretary said the President’s suggestion
                        for a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> in New
                        York still stood, but if <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> led
                        the <gloss target="#t_SSOD_1">SSOD</gloss> delegation, the Secretary would
                        look forward to meeting with him. Asked about a formal summit in October,
                        Secretary said in principle we had nothing against an eventual summit,
                        provided conditions were right.</p>
                    <p>4. Geopolitical Issues: On Poland, Secretary emphasized that dialogue, not
                        confrontation, was the only solution to the Polish crisis, that recent
                        demonstrations only underlined the need for a process of national
                        reconciliation, and that further regime brutality could sour the atmosphere
                        of the U.S.-Soviet relationship. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said the Soviet side saw things differently; if the
                        U.S. would ease up on Poland, the U.S. would be surprised at the response.
                        The Secretary indicated that the Polish leadership was well aware that we
                        were prepared to be forthcoming on economic relations once our three
                        conditions were met. <pb n="543" facs="0574" xml:id="pg_543"/>On South
                        Africa, the Secretary said we were fully aware of Soviet efforts to
                        undermine our peace efforts, and gave <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> a non-paper (being pouched) on this score.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> claimed the Soviet side
                        also wished to see the problems of that region solved, and said the Soviet
                        side might be able to assist if it knew more precisely what the U.S. was up
                        to. The Secretary responded that, as he had made clear to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, we hoped for Moscow’s cooperation
                        and were prepared to discuss the problem further with the Soviet side. On
                        Afghanistan, the Secretary said this issue remained a major impediment to
                        progress in the relationship. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> remarked that the Soviet side was still awaiting a
                        U.S. response on experts’ talks; the Secretary said we had the matter under
                        active review and would be back in touch on this shortly. On the Falklands,
                        the Secretary underscored our earlier warnings that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> remain uninvolved (<persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> predictably insisted that the
                        Soviets were uninvolved).</p>
                    <p>5. Jewish Emigration: The Secretary said that Soviet Jewish emigration had
                        come to a virtual halt, and this was of great concern to the administration
                        as well as to the American Congress and people. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> replied that this issue should not be placed at the
                        center of U.S.-Soviet relations. The Secretary emphasized that no matter
                        where one placed the issue, it remained critical to the overall
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p>6. Bilateral Issues: <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> raised
                        the recent U.S. decision to extend the West Coast cooperative fishing
                        venture, saying that “top levels” in Moscow took note of a statement by the
                        U.S. Embassy in Moscow that this <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                        decision should not be read as a political signal. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> ridiculed this statement,
                        remarking that since the agreement was of substantial economic benefit to
                        the U.S., it was hard to see how any sort of “signal” was involved.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> also raised the
                        consulates issue, noting that the Soviet Embassy had recently been informed
                        that the Soviet-owned consulate building in New York could not be occupied
                        by even one or two Soviet families, while the U.S. was free to use its
                        apartments in Kiev. The Secretary indicated that the U.S. decision on joint
                        fishing spoke for itself, and that he would look into the consulates
                        question.</p>

                    <p>On May 9, 1982, President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Ronald

                        Eureka College. In it, he spoke about his May 7 letter to Soviet General
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Leonid Brezhnev</persName> (see <ref target="#d166">Document 166</ref>), and his direction that Secretary of

                        Security Council to establish U.S. negotiating positions on the Strategic

                        what we should do to keep Afghanistan front and center as a geopolitical
                        issue, while maintaining the support of the many other countries opposing
                        Soviet aggression there. This is particularly important as we move to
                        commence <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> negotiations, since we
                        must leave no doubt in anyone’s mind that we are <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                        retreating toward an arms control-centered relationship with the Soviets and
                        easing up on our geopolitical concerns.</p>
                    <p>I believe that one aspect of our effort to keep Afghanistan up front should
                        be an intensification of our ongoing dialogue with the Soviets on what would
                        be required to achieve a political solution, especially withdrawal of Soviet
                        forces. We are moving to increase pressure on the ground and ensure that the
                        costs of the occupation to the Soviets remain high. To balance this in a way
                        that makes clear both our concern for Afghanistan and our willingness to
                        talk as well as fight, we should take a step forward in our direct exchanges
                        with the Soviets, and let it be known that we are doing so.</p>
                    <p>In these exchanges we have made clear that we are determined to talk <hi rend="italic">only</hi> if the Soviets are willing to address the issues
                        seriously. The possibility of U.S.-Soviet “experts’ talks” has also arisen.
                        Such talks would permit us to probe further whether there is real
                        willingness on Moscow’s part to move toward an acceptable political
                        settlement. I am not overly hopeful that Soviet willingness to engage in
                        such talks reflects a decision to seek a way out of their stalemated
                        situation in Afghanistan, but our exchanges thus far justify further
                        probing.</p>
                    <p>I propose to go to the Soviets to start such talks. If they agree, as I
                        expect they will, we will background the media that we are intensifying the
                        dialogue on Afghanistan. We will do this at roughly the same time we
                        announce a beginning to <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>. While we
                        would not directly <pb n="546" facs="0577" xml:id="pg_546"/>link the
                        Afghanistan “experts’ talks” to <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>,
                        the roughly parallel timing of the two steps would speak for itself.</p>
                    <p>A decision to begin more detailed “experts’ talks” with the Soviets would
                        involve some risk to our relations with our partners on the Afghanistan
                        problem. Thus, it will be important for us [to] contain these risks by
                        making clear that these talks are an intensification of our existing
                        contacts with the Soviets in diplomatic channels, rather than a new
                        departure reflecting our abandonment of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>’s and EC–10’s efforts to achieve a political settlement. At
                        the same time, by demonstrating our own commitment to a political settlement
                        based on Soviet withdrawal, we might also shore up Pakistani determination
                        not to allow the current <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> initiative for
                        indirect talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan to lend legitimacy to the
                        Afghan puppet regime.</p>
                    <p>Our intention would be to carry out the talks through our respective
                        embassies in Washington and Moscow, rather than in a separate forum as in
                        the INF talks. We would also make clear that the fact of our talks with the
                        Soviets will not affect other aspects of our Afghanistan policy or our
                        broader Southwest Asia strategy. Indeed, we would handle these talks as only
                        one element of an ongoing strategy to sustain and intensify pressure on
                        Moscow for withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>Before approaching the Soviets to suggest that more detailed, exploratory
                        talks begin, we will conduct appropriate consultations with the Pakistanis,
                        as well with our closest European Allies, the Chinese and the <gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss> countries, who see a close parallel
                        between Afghanistan and the situation in Kampuchea.</p>

                    <p>Soviet leaders are keen on summits with U.S. Presidents and for good reason.
                        They feel confident they will come out ahead in such encounters because</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>—their government has greater continuity than ours and therefore
                            greater store of expertise in international affairs;</p>
                        <p>—well-publicized summits arouse expectations in free societies which
                            enable Moscow, by manipulating Western opinion, to exert pressure on
                            their opposite numbers for unreciprocated concessions. (C)</p>
               </quote>
                    <p>They further favor summits because they afford them the opportunity to size
                        up the President as a person and as a statesman. (C)</p>
                    <p>Experience indicates that U.S.-Soviet summits, from Roosevelt’s Yalta to
                        Nixon’s Moscow, have generally turned out to the disadvantage of the United
                        States. Still, inasmuch as every U.S. President since 1933 has personally
                        met with his Soviet counterpart, it will be difficult for you to reject a
                        summit altogether. A full-fledged summit, however, should take place only if
                        the following conditions are met:</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>—Moscow demonstrates by deeds rather than words that it is prepared to
                            negotiate seriously.</p>
                        <p>—The groundwork is well prepared beforehand so that you discuss concrete
                            agenda items and do not become embroiled in longwinded ideological
                            disputes of the kind that Khruschev lured <persName corresp="#p_KRT_1">Kennedy</persName> into in Vienna in 1961 and which invariably end
                            in the hardening of respective positions. (C)</p>
               </quote>
                    <p>A good model to follow in this matter is President Eisenhower who had given
                        it much thought. In 1953, after Stalin’s death President Eisenhower came
                        under great pressure from our Allies (especially Britain) and the State
                        Department to hold a summit with G. Malenkov, Stalin’s immediate successor.
                        In his memoirs, Eisenhower tells why he resisted these pressures. He reviews
                        the disappointing experiences of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt with
                        summit meetings and says: “I was . . . not willing to meet with Communist
                        leaders unless <pb n="548" facs="0579" xml:id="pg_548"/>there was some
                        likelihood that the confrontation would produce results acceptable to the
                        peoples of the West”. (C)</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>“. . . I developed a stock answer to any question about a possible
                            Summit. I would not go to a Summit merely because of friendly words and
                            plausible promises by the men in the Kremlin; <hi rend="italic">actual
                                deeds</hi> giving some indication of a Communist readiness to
                            negotiate constructively will have to be produced before I would agree
                            to such a meeting.”</p>

                    <p>He was rewarded for his firm stand with a Soviet troop withdrawal from
                        Austria. (C)</p>
                    <p>This is a good principle to keep in mind as the Russians increase their
                        pressure for a summit. It would be best to have no summit this year: but if
                        one is to be held the Russians should be required to demonstrate their good
                        will by such actions as acceptance of our “zero option”, withdrawal from
                        Afghanistan or lifting of the martial law in Poland. (C)</p>

                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>He criticizes negotiations on “any one component” with “no connection to
                        others”—probably referring to bombers and cruise missiles—and claims that
                        the “substantial” reductions we propose would be substantial only for the
                        Soviet side. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> again called
                        for preserving “positive” achievements so far—meaning the essential elements
                        of <pb n="549" facs="0580" xml:id="pg_549"/>
                  <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. He also repeated his call for a quantitative freeze on
                        strategic arsenals and limiting modernization as soon as <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> begins. This does not seem to be a
                        precondition for talks, but only to “create favorable conditions” for them.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> agreed that the time and
                        venue for <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> be discussed in the “near
                        future” through diplomatic channels.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> felt compelled to come back
                        at you on the matter of restraint in international affairs by stating that
                        the Soviets expect restraint on our part. While noting “incessant (US)
                        attacks” regarding the Soviet Union, he claimed to be seeking neither sharp
                        polemics nor confrontation. The tone of the letter is cool and correct by
                        Soviet standards.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
                    <p>With regard to your message to me of May 7, 1982 I would like above all to
                        emphasize that the Soviet Union—the correspondence between us being a clear
                        testimony thereof—has been steadily and persistently calling on the United
                        States to agree on joint measures aimed at effectively bridling the arms
                        race, first of all, in nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>We have been proceeding from the premise that only by moving along this path
                        is it possible to achieve the objective of preventing a nuclear war, which
                        would become an irreparable tragedy for all mankind.</p>
                    <p>Life itself puts questions of limitation and reduction of strategic arms in
                        the center of Soviet-American relations. We have always favored increasingly
                        radical steps in this direction. And it is not our fault that the strategic
                        arms limitation process was interrupted for a long period of time.<note n="5" xml:id="d171fn5">

                            margin: “? History does not confirm.”</note>
                  </p>
                    <p>References made to this or that event on the international scene cannot
                        justify the lack of readiness on the part of the U.S. to resolve the issue
                        which you yourself justly call one of critical importance for <pb n="550" facs="0581" xml:id="pg_550"/>our two countries and the world at large.
                        And the special responsibility of our two countries and their leaders in
                        this respect is certainly not a thing that has emerged today. That
                        responsibility existed in equal measure one year ago, a year and a half ago.
                        On our part we always proceeded from this premise.<note n="6" xml:id="d171fn6">

                            underlined the previous two sentences and wrote in the right-hand
                            margin: “How about the last 35 years?”</note>
                  </p>
                    <p>If the U.S. side has now come to understand the need to resume negotiations
                        on the problem of strategic arms, that in itself is a positive fact.</p>
                    <p>Our position of principle in favor of continuing such negotiations is surely
                        well known to you. I can reaffirm that it has not changed. We agree that
                        specific questions concerning the organizational aspect of those
                        negotiations, including the time and venue for holding them, be discussed in
                        the near future through diplomatic channels.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of the coming negotiations, one can be certain that a great deal of
                        effort will be required to recoup for the time lost and the opportunities
                        missed. But that must be done. Helpful in this respect can be, first, the
                        preservation of whatever positive has already been achieved through the
                        joint efforts of our two countries in the area of strategic arms limitation
                        and, second, a genuinely serious willingness to seek a mutually acceptable
                        agreement commensurate with the scope and significance of the truly historic
                        task that stands before us.</p>
                    <p>In other words it is important that the negotiations be set on the right
                        course from the very beginning, that they be conducted constructively
                        without one side attempting to gain advantage in them at the expense of the
                        other.</p>
                    <p>I deem it necessary to say it with all clarity, since the position with which
                        the U.S., judging by your speech of May 9, is approaching the negotiations
                        cannot but cause apprehension and even doubts as to the seriousness of the
                        intentions of the U.S. side.<note n="7" xml:id="d171fn7">

                  </p>
                    <p>After all, it is obvious that to isolate just any one component out of the
                        totality of the strategic systems and to make it a subject of negotiations
                        with no connection to the others, as you suggest, would inevitably lead to a
                        distorted picture of the balance of forces between the sides. Thus, the
                        “substantial” reductions the U.S. side is talking about on the basis of the
                        picture it has itself presented would naturally be substantial only for the
                        Soviet side.<note n="8" xml:id="d171fn8">

                    <pb n="551" facs="0582" xml:id="pg_551"/>
                    <p>Only one thing would be the result of such a one-sided approach—an upsetting
                        of the existing balance of forces<note n="9" xml:id="d171fn9">
                        <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> underlined “of the existing

                            imbalance.”</note> and a breach of that very stability which the U.S.
                        side is allegedly so anxious to ensure.</p>
                    <p>There should be no misunderstanding, Mr. President: this is not a realistic
                        position, not the path toward agreement. Besides, as you know, we are not
                        the only ones who hold such a view.</p>
                    <p>We believe it is difficult to argue against the fact that, when it comes to
                        matters touching upon national security, neither side can allow a tilt to be
                        made in favor of the other and to the detriment of its legitimate interests.
                        We are realists and do not expect that the United States would accept that.
                        To an equal degree, it cannot be expected of the Soviet Union either. I
                        consider it necessary to state this directly, with nothing omitted.</p>
                    <p>In your letter you mention that a possible agreement should be understandable
                        and acceptable to the American people. But this does not make any more
                        convincing the arguments for such an approach which is clearly unacceptable
                        to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, to the Soviet people.</p>
                    <p>Taking this opportunity, I would like to say that I found it necessary also
                        to express publicly in my speech on May 18, 1982 at the Komsomol Congress,
                        our attitude toward such a one-sided approach and our opinion regarding the
                        principles on which a genuinely fair and equitable agreement on the
                        limitation and reduction of strategic arms should be based.</p>
                    <p>In doing so, I also stated the readiness of the Soviet Union to reach
                        agreement with the United States to the effect that right now, as soon as
                        the negotiations begin, the strategic nature of both countries be frozen
                        quantitatively and that their modernization be limited to the utmost. Such
                        agreement would, in our view, create favorable conditions for the
                        negotiations and facilitate achieving the objectives therein. I would ask
                        you, Mr. President, carefully to consider this proposal.<note n="10" xml:id="d171fn10">

                  </p>
                    <p>I am convinced that the American people would understand and support an
                        agreement between the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> which would be based on the principle of
                        equality and equal security, and which would meet the objective of mutual
                        limitation and reduction of strategic arms, just as they have supported the
                        previously reached agreements that you cited. Soviet people—and you can take
                        my word for that—will resolutely support such an agreement.<note n="11" xml:id="d171fn11">

                    <p>And the last point. In our correspondence I have already spoken about to whom
                        an appeal for restraint in international affairs should be addressed. Since
                        you raise that subject again, I shall only say, without repeating myself,
                        that it is precisely of the U.S. that we, and indeed other countries, expect
                        restraint and a constructive approach both to issues of bilateral relations
                        and to fundamental international problems, above all to those related to
                        limiting the arms race and strengthening common security.</p>
                    <p>We, of course, are giving and will continue to give a proper evaluation to
                        unacceptable manifestations in U.S. policy as well as to the incessant
                        attacks made regarding the Soviet Union. But we, on our part, have been
                        seeking neither sharp polemics nor confrontation.</p>
                    <p>You may be assured, Mr. President, that a readiness to deal on an equal
                        basis, to respect the interests of each other, and to develop mutual trust,
                        will meet a most positive response on the part of the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>We will, as before, continue to do all we can so that people can look into
                        the future with confidence and calm, without fearing for the threat of war
                        which is not needed equally—I repeat, equally—either by the Soviet or the
                        American people.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Bill:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>When we spoke last week you encouraged me to share with you my thoughts on
                        U.S. foreign policy. I am taking advantage of this invitation to convey to
                        you my sense of alarm over the possibility that the U.S. may, in effect,
                        suspend its current sanctions against the Soviet Union. Nothing that has
                        occurred since President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                        assumed office fourteen months ago seems to me so fraught with dangers to
                        national security and to the political fortunes of the President.</p>
                    <p>Let me briefly recall how these sanctions had come into force. When on
                        December 13th the <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Jaruzelski</persName> junta
                        declared war on its own people we at once pinpointed the Soviet Union as the
                        main culprit and set in motion a series of economic sanctions as punishment.
                        We explicitly warned at the time that unless the situation in Poland
                        improved significantly, further sanctions would follow. In reality, neither
                        happened: the situation in Poland has not improved, nor have we introduced
                        additional sanctions. For a while we contemplated extending our sanctions
                        extraterritorially to U.S. subsidiaries and licencees abroad but this was
                        not done because it was decided such a measure would cause too much friction
                        in the alliance. Instead, we were to explore the possibilities of
                        inter-allied cooperation on restricting credit flows to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. The purpose of the <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Buckley</persName> Mission was to ascertain how far
                        the Allies would be willing to go in cooperating with us on credit controls
                        in order to avoid the extension of U.S. sanctions extraterritorially. Its
                        results were meager but at least major friction in the alliance was
                        avoided.</p>
                    <p>Now, I understand, the Department of State proposes that we significantly
                        dilute the sanctions by exempting items contracted for before December 30,
                        1981 in return for allied cooperation on credit controls (that had been
                        originally proposed as a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> for the
                        abandonment of extraterritoriality on our part). This would enable General
                        Electric to sell the rotors that seem essential if the Siberian Pipeline is
                        to be completed on schedule.</p>
                    <p>I am convinced that such a move would be catastrophic. We can live with the
                        Siberian Pipeline, but we will find it hard to live down <pb n="554" facs="0585" xml:id="pg_554"/>the loss of credibility. Twice in three
                        years we have introduced sanctions against the Soviet Union: first for the
                        invasion of Afghanistan, then for martial law in Poland. The Afghan
                        sanctions, which were centered on the grain embargo, were rescinded by
                        President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>—a move which,
                        whatever its economic rationale, encouraged cynicism in Europe about our
                        motives and made it that much more difficult to secure European cooperation
                        in December 1981. If we now dilute to the point of emasculation the
                        sanctions imposed in December 1981, without the Soviet Union or Poland
                        having met our stated preconditions for such action, we will destroy once
                        and for all any credibility of the policy of economic sanctions. In fact, we
                        will have given up using economic leverage to influence Soviet behavior.
                        Please consider what this will mean for our relations with friend and foe
                        alike:</p>
                    <p>—Our Allies will dismiss any future pressures we may want to exert on them to
                        react to Soviet aggression outside of Western Europe and confine themselves
                        to verbal condemnation: we will only confirm the argumentation of those
                        among them who argue we are an impulsive people who need to be humored but
                        must not be followed.</p>
                    <p>—Conservative Republicans and Democrats alike will be dismayed; American
                        liberals will be gratified but they are so strongly opposed to the
                        President’s domestic programs that they will still refuse him their
                        support.</p>
                    <p>—The Soviet government will conclude that President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> has no staying power and that his
                        anti-Communism is (as some of them have argued all along) mainly rhetorical:
                        such a perception will surely have immense bearing on Soviet calculations in
                        planning future aggression (e.g. against Iran or Pakistan) as well as on
                        Soviet negotiating strategies in INF and <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> talks.</p>
                    <p>Of course, it is said that we would be only exchanging one set of sanctions
                        for another. But a realistic appraisal of Europe’s trade relations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> must lead one to the conclusion
                        that there is virtually no chance of effective credit controls being
                        enacted. The Allies regard trade with the Soviet Bloc as essential to their
                        economies. The Germans, in addition, view trade—and the credits which make
                        it possible—as critical to the maintenance of working relations with East
                        Germany. I am persuaded that any credit accords we will obtain in exchange
                        for lifting the sanctions will be essentially cosmetic in nature.</p>
                    <p>We have basically two and only two levers to use toward the Soviet Union: the
                        economic and the military. If we drop the economic lever (as, in effect, we
                        will be doing if we follow State’s advice) we will have no choice but to
                        rely on the military one. In other words, as we abandon economic pressures
                        in the face of Soviet aggression we will, of necessity, have to resort to
                        military moves which will increase the likelihood of confrontation and
                        conflict. Unless we are prepared to accept Soviet <pb n="555" facs="0586" xml:id="pg_555"/>global hegemony—which I am sure none of us do—giving up
                        economic sanctions will force us unto dangerous paths. This would be
                        particularly regrettable now that the Soviet Union faces an unprecedented
                        economic crisis and is more than ever vulnerable to various economic
                        pressures.</p>
                    <p>For all these reasons, I urge you strongly to oppose State’s proposal.</p>
                    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

                     <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s speech is clearly <hi rend="italic">aimed at public opinion</hi> in the United States and
                        especially Western Europe. It emphasizes grand gestures, both in <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> and INF, but gives little insight into
                        the Soviet negotiating approach. It nevertheless constitutes a relatively
                        mild and constructive-sounding reply to your Eureka speech. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s <hi rend="italic">major points
                            and our comments follow</hi>.</p>

                    <p>
                     <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> proposes a prompt interim <hi rend="italic">quantitative freeze and qualitative restraints on
                            strategic nuclear weapons</hi>. Playing to the nuclear freeze movement,
                        this proposal is a logical extension of Soviet proposals for an INF freeze.
                        It does not specify the units which would be frozen or the way in which
                        modernization could be limited. We can expect <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s call for a strategic weapons freeze to feature
                        prominently in Soviet propaganda.</p>
                    <p>Concurring in the need for substantial reductions, he welcomes US willingness
                        to negotiate on strategic arms and says the <hi rend="italic">talks should
                            begin immediately</hi>. He gives no signal on a date or venue, but I
                        expect to hear from the Soviet side through diplomatic channels in the near
                        future.</p>

                     <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> predictably <hi rend="italic">criticizes your <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> proposals</hi>
                        as facilitating a quest for US military superiority and jeopardizing Soviet
                        security. These criticisms fall short of rejecting the US proposals,
                        although the Soviets will clearly seek to broaden the focus of <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> negotiations well beyond the US
                        proposals when talks begin.</p>
                    <p>He proposes <hi rend="italic">banning or severely restricting the development
                            of new types of strategic weapons</hi>. While this posture has public
                        appeal, it also probably results from the Soviet desire to restrain US
                        technology, particularly development of the D–5.</p>
                    <p>He proposes <hi rend="italic">three general principles</hi> for successful
                        strategic negotiations: the pursuit of actual limits and reductions, not
                        camouflage for a <pb n="557" facs="0588" xml:id="pg_557"/>continuing
                        buildup; respect for each other’s legitimate security interests and the
                        principle of equality and equal security; and preservation of “everything
                        positive” which has been achieved earlier. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> stopped short of mentioning <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II.</p>

                     <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> pays <hi rend="italic">more
                            detailed attention to INF</hi> than to <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> and says that “the key task today (in the quest for
                        peace) is to lower the nuclear confrontation in Europe.”</p>
                    <p>
                     <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> expresses readiness to
                        consider <hi rend="italic">deeper INF reductions than the two-third
                            cuts</hi> the Soviet Union had previously proposed. The meaning of this
                        will have to be explored in the INF negotiations.</p>
                    <p>He <hi rend="italic">reports reduction of a “considerable” number of INF
                            missiles</hi>. These are presumably obsolete SS–4s and SS–5s undergoing
                        normal retirement.</p>
                    <p>He announces that <hi rend="italic">“no medium-range missiles will be
                            additionally deployed in places from which both the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> and other countries of Western Europe
                            could be within their reach.”</hi> We believe that the Soviet moratorium
                        offer of 16 March included SS–20s at some Asian bases within range of
                        Western Europe. If this is true, he is making explicit an aspect of their
                        original offer, but in so doing he admits the validity of our position that
                        limits on missiles “in Europe” alone are inadequate.</p>
                    <p>He confirms that the Soviet INF freeze “envisages” <hi rend="italic">termination of preparation for missile deployments, including
                            construction of launch sites</hi>. This clarification is aimed at
                        hampering our own site preparations, and it responds to US criticism that
                        construction was continuing at some sites even after the moratorium. Very
                        recent intelligence indicates ongoing construction at SS–20 sites, and we
                        will watch closely to see if it stops after the speech.</p>
                    <p>Calling our desire for a US-Soviet agreement on global INF limitations
                        “absurd,” he announces that the question of <hi rend="italic">missiles in
                            the Eastern part of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                     </hi>
                        could only be addressed in negotiations “with those in whose hands are the
                        nuclear means which are opposed by our missiles.” Without calling for Asian

                        President, as you will recall, you have decided to hold in abeyance the
                        extraterritorial application of sanctions in order to give <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Jim Buckley</persName> the opportunity to see if a
                        mechanism to restrict the flow of government guaranteed credits can be put
                        in place. He and I have worked with the Europeans on this matter. We have
                        not made an explicit offer of a deal, but we have told them that we would be
                        flexible on existing contracts if a mechanism similar to <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> could be put in place to control the
                        flow of credits for the remainder of this century. Most European countries
                        are very supportive and so are the Japanese. The most negative response
                        comes from the French who claim that they have a private arrangement with
                        the Soviet Union which precludes such measures. There is a problem with the
                        rotors for the Siberian pipeline, but the Europeans are determined to go
                        ahead and find alternate sources if we give them no choice. <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Cheysson</persName> suggested that they would be
                        flexible on this matter, however. This Thursday [May 27] <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Jim Buckley</persName> will have further meetings
                        with the Europeans. I suggest that we make the Europeans a specific, rather
                        than an implicit, offer. The Europeans realize that we are prepared to
                        suspend extraterritoriality if we obtain in return good and hard commitments
                        on the pipeline issue. The first leg of the Siberian pipeline is a <hi rend="italic">fait accompli:</hi> whether or not we help, we cannot
                        prevent its completion. Our leverage applies only to the future. I suggest
                        that we ask Jim to tell the Europeans we are prepared to be flexible on
                        sanctions if they support credit controls and promise to limit future
                        pipeline construction: that is, that they not build a second leg of the
                        Siberian pipeline. They also should be prepared to limit their purchases of
                        Soviet fuel in the future. Then, after the Summit, we should go back and
                        take a look at the whole issue of sanctions because there are serious doubts
                        as to whether they are effective and whether they do not punish us more than
                        the Soviet Union. A good case can be made that they do.</p>
                    <p>In addition, there is a peripheral question of lesser magnitude. It involves
                        the Japanese participation in the Sakhalin project.<note n="3" xml:id="d174fn3">A reference to a Soviet-Japanese agreement to drill for
                            oil on the Soviet island of Sakhalin using Japanese equipment in
                            exchange for oil exports to Japan at a reduced price.</note> The
                        Japanese require critical drilling equipment, worth about $2.0 million,
                        which they can obtain only in the United States. The Japanese must know
                        before the end of the month whether this equipment will become available to
                        them or they will be in deep trouble with the Soviets. The Soviets threaten
                        that, if they do not get it, they will go elsewhere. We must be consistent.
                        Painful as it may be, we should let the Japanese obtain this drilling
                        equipment, if they give us in return firm support on credits and energy.</p>

                        Allies on long-term energy projects. We believe that the probability of the
                        completion of the first leg of the Siberian pipeline is only about 85
                        percent.</p>

                        disagree in general with the State Department’s position. We concur that the
                        Sakhalin project is part of an overall problem and that if you give in to
                        the Japanese you will jeopardize the sanctions as a whole and open us up to
                        European pressures. This is no time to lift the sanctions. Martial law
                        continues in Poland and we should continue our pressures. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Al Haig</persName> is right that our pressure will
                        cause the Europeans to look elsewhere and that <gloss target="#t_GE_1">GE</gloss> jobs will in effect be exported to France, but the
                        alternative is to lift the sanctions entirely and this is not the time for
                        that. Credit controls are fine, but we seriously doubt if anything tangible
                        can be obtained on this issue before the Versailles Summit, given the French
                        attitude. Should the Siberian and Sakhalin pipelines be built, this will be
                        as important in the long run as are credits. The pipeline is by no means
                        set, many Europeans have doubts about it. The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> estimates that the construction of the rotors by
                        Alsthom-Atlantique will push up the price. It is true that we cannot stop
                        the Siberian pipeline, but we can delay it. Some Europeans are beginning to
                        worry whether the construction of the Siberian pipeline will not preempt the
                        development of North Sea oil resources.</p>

                     <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName>:</hi> I am
                        not speaking for any business constituency, but I am convinced that the
                        sanctions won’t work in the sense that we want them to work, that is to
                        delay the pipeline construction. The Russians will have many delays in any
                        event. It is unlikely that the pipeline will be completed before 1986. I
                        support the position of the State Department, but I believe we should not
                        make specific promises until we have had a chance to agree with the
                        Europeans on alternate sources and credit restrictions. What we will lose in
                        sanctions will be well worth the gains attained by this strategy. As
                        concerns Sakhalin, we have seen some movement from the Japanese on credit
                        restraints. In general, the Japanese have been cooperative even though there
                        is evidence that they have backdated their Komatsu contracts. I have mixed
                        emotions on the Sakhalin project, but if we can get help from the Japanese
                        on credits and a promise of no further Komatsu sales, then it may be well
                        worth it to let them have what they want.</p>

                        on the 27th on the issue of credits. After that we can give attention to the
                        pipeline. We should send a letter to the heads of state urging an agreement
                        on limiting credits to the Soviets. If we get concurrence on this, then this
                        issue can be removed from the agenda of the summit. If the Japanese feel
                        that they have to go ahead, let them, as long as they keep the downpayment
                        to 40 percent. But don’t let them have the equipment unless they agree—they
                        are desperate for time. I think we can let the <gloss target="#t_GE_1">GE</gloss> rotors go but not until we have obtained a real commitment
                        on limiting purchases of gas and the development of the North Sea. As
                        concerns credits, this is not a big deal. There are only $400–$500 million
                        of export subsidies a year. Let us ask the Russians to put up 30 percent
                        instead of 15 percent. The French say they have a protocol with the
                        Russians, but no one has seen it. They claim they are committed in it until
                        1985 to go on 15 percent. Their credits are mainly government backed.
                        Private sources charge more than the government. By placing the Soviet Union
                        in the top bracket, all one got was a raise in interest rates from 11-½ to
                        12-½ percent. We are really not talking about an awful lot in restraining
                        credits. It will cost the Russians something, but not bring them to their
                        knees. In sum, I urge that a letter be sent to the heads of state, tied to
                        the <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Buckley</persName> mission, to get an
                        agreement. Then we can talk about the pipeline after the summit.</p>

                        will depend for 20–25 percent of its energy resources on the Soviet Union.
                        If Soviet energy supplies are fully developed, then whoever sits where you
                        are sitting now, Mr. President, ten years from now will confront a situation
                        where Europe obtains 50 percent of its gas supplies from the Soviet Union.
                        The Soviet Union at that time will earn 80 percent of its hard currency
                        earnings from gas sales. Any leverage we have should be used because credit
                        controls are not adequate. It is true that the pipeline cannot be stopped,
                        but we can delay it and make it more costly. We should aim at a swap:
                        develop North Sea resources and give up the pipeline. I certainly agree with
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Don Regan</persName> that no decision should
                        be made before the summit. Also, we should not relax the sanctions imposed
                        on Poland, where the situation has gotten worse. Norway has great potential
                        to supply energy. It is critical that we do what we can to restrict
                        long-term dependency on Soviet supplies. Credit restraints are nowhere near
                        adequate compensation.</p>

                        to the good. In other words, we have support inside France. More
                        importantly, I believe that to lift sanctions would be political dynamite.
                        On four specific occasions, Mr. President, you have publicly committed
                        yourself to take stronger measures if there is no easing of the situation in
                        Poland. There has been no easing of the situation there and now we may
                        retract the sanctions. You have been criticized for being too weak. We would
                        be very vulnerable. To permit <pb n="563" facs="0594" xml:id="pg_563"/>the

                        for the U.S. unemployed. How are we going to explain that nothing has
                        improved in Poland, but that business is business? We have arguments on our
                        side. Why don’t we provide the leadership and tell the Europeans who is the

                    <p>1. (S—Entire text.)</p>
                    <p>2. Begin summary. Calling on instructions May 25, Soviet Charge <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> registered Soviet
                        non-acceptance of U.S. conceptual approach as sole basis for beginning
                            <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> negotiations and then proposed
                        that negotiations begin in Geneva June 29, with announcement June 1. (We are
                        staffing further discussion of modalities and this info is <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss> only.) <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> made further instructed comments, keyed to
                        Secretary’s May 7 talk with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2">See <ref target="#d168">Document 168</ref>.</note> on Poland, the South

                        was an additional instructed comment on the Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> read and gave <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> text of nonpaper warning
                        against Soviet and Cuban involvement in the Falklands crisis. <gloss target="#t_EUR_1">EUR</gloss> Assistant Secretary-designate <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> asked about <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> meeting at <gloss target="#t_SSOD_1">SSOD</gloss>;
                            <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said he expected to
                        be back in touch soon. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. Soviet Charge Aleksandr Bessmertnykh called at his request at 1000 hrs May
                        25 on Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> to
                        make instructed comments on <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>,
                        geopolitical issues discussed by Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> May 7, and Middle East. <gloss target="#t_EUR_1">EUR</gloss> AS designate <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName>
                        participated; <gloss target="#t_EURSOV_1">EUR/SOV</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> was notetaker.</p>
                    <p>4. <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> substance. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said he was instructed to
                        provide additional considerations on the essence of the Soviet approach.
                        Reading from notes, he said <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s May 20 letter to the President<note n="3" xml:id="d175fn3">See the attachment to <ref target="#d171">Document
                                171</ref>.</note> sets forth the Soviet position of principle re
                        negotiations on limitation and reduction of strategic arms. As should be
                        clear from that letter, the Soviet side cannot agree that U.S. proposals on
                        the substance of the problem, as formulated in the President’s May 9 speech,
                        are of a realistic nature and that they are feasible and suitable as a
                        subject of negotiations.</p>
                    <p>5. The Soviets have the definite impression, as do others, that the
                        administration is approaching the negotiations with a clearly unacceptable,
                        one-sided position, <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>
                        continued. It must be under<pb n="566" facs="0597" xml:id="pg_566"/>stood
                        that to declare a slogan of radical reductions is not enough, and that what
                        is required is a basis for negotiations that would ensure achieving lower
                        levels of opposing nuclear forces—and the Soviet side is for this—but
                        without upsetting the existing balance or disrupting strategic stability. In
                        other words we must be strictly guided by the principle of equality and
                        equal security and must take each other’s interests into account.</p>
                    <p>6. The Soviets are convinced, he went on, that the interests of both sides
                        would be served if negotiations were set on the right track from the very
                        beginning, if they opened a realistic way to reach mutually acceptable
                        agreement. It would be a mistake to believe that one side is more interested
                        than the other in reaching such an agreement. The issues involved are too
                        great and sensitive for that. Their resolution will determine not only the
                        state of U.S.-Soviet relations in the future but also the prospects for
                        preserving peace throughout the world. The Soviets believe negotiations
                        should be conducted in a serious manner and not serve as a cover for a
                        continued arms race.</p>
                    <p>7. <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> substance—U.S. response.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> said we would study the
                        Soviet comments carefully. As he had said before, we believe the U.S.
                        proposals set forth in general terms by the President are reasonable and
                        form a good basis for talks leading to reductions. The President also
                        promised we would study all Soviet proposals. <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> noted the President had also stated nothing is excluded
                        from the negotiation. Our focus is on the most destabilizing systems, but we
                        are willing to look at other approaches too.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> asked if the Soviet
                        statement concerning the basis for negotiation meant the Soviet side rejects
                        the U.S. approach. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>
                        specified that it meant the U.S. approach cannot be considered the sole
                        conceptual basis for talks. It is not, however, a precondition for talks; he
                        also had instructions concerning modalities. The Soviet statement means that
                        each side has now made clear what it thinks the basic approach to talks
                        should be. The Soviets do not accept that the U.S. line set forth by the
                        President and elaborated by the Secretary is a feasible approach to
                        negotiations; it is too one-sided.</p>
                    <p>9. <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> modalities. Proceeding to his
                        instructions on “organizational aspects,” <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said:</p>
                    <p>—On venue, the Soviets find Geneva acceptable, and think it can be considered
                        agreed.</p>
                    <p>—On time, the Soviets propose June 29, Tuesday.</p>
                    <p>—On “personalities,” the Soviet delegation will be led by Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_KVP_1">Karpov</persName>, known to the U.S. side
                        from <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, and he assumed the U.S.
                        delegation would be led by General <persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowny</persName>.</p>
                    <p>—On characterization, the Soviets propose “negotiations on limitation and
                        reduction of strategic arms.” This reflects the subject more <pb n="567" facs="0598" xml:id="pg_567"/>completely and more accurately, <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> argued, since there are
                        qualitative as well as quantitative limitations involved.</p>
                    <p>—On announcements, the Soviets propose a joint announcement June 1. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> commented he hoped the U.S.
                        side would be back soon on this question, since the practice had been to
                        inform the Swiss through instructions to our two Ambassadors in Switzerland
                        beforehand.</p>
                    <p>10. <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> modalities: U.S. response.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> said we welcome the
                        specific Soviet ideas and will respond quickly. <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> would be in touch soon concerning the announcement.
                            (<gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>, we are staffing the next steps
                        concerning the announcement, and this report on discussion of modalities is
                        for your information only. End <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>.)</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> then proceeded to
                        make instructed comments on the regional issues raised in the Secretary’s
                        May 7 meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>.</p>
                    <p>12. Poland. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said the
                        Soviets would like to call our attention to the fact that the Polish
                        leadership has taken a number of steps to normalize the situation. To turn a
                        blind eye to this fact would be to ignore the actual situation in Poland
                        deliberately. There is also evidence that there are forces which would like
                        to complicate the normalization process artificially and to aggravate the
                        situation both in and around Poland. The Polish authorities have facts
                        concerning the involvement of the United States in this regard. If the U.S.
                        side really wishes to see the situation in Poland calm down, it will have to
                        renounce efforts to interfere in Polish affairs completely.</p>
                    <p>13. Poland—U.S. response. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>
                        replied that we reject the assertions about U.S. involvement in the type of
                        activity mentioned, and continue to hope for progress toward stabilization
                        and reconciliation. We had noted the steps taken, but our hopes had been
                        dashed by the brutal repression of the demonstrations of May 13. This had
                        caused great concern here. It was not a mark of progress. But we still
                        continue to hope that Poland will return to the objectives <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Jaruzelski</persName> had identified after December
                        13: Release of the prisoners and resumption of dialogue with the church and
                        the labor union.</p>
                    <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> rejoined that
                        normalization is going on, in industry, in the flow of money back to Western
                        banks and last, in transport. The situation is difficult, but normalization
                        is on track. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> concluded that
                        too many Poles, including Walesa, are still locked up.</p>
                    <p>15. Afghanistan. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said
                        that re a political settlement of the situation around Afghanistan, the
                        Soviets understand that the U.S. expressed interest in an appropriate
                        exchange of views between the two countries at the level of experts. The
                        Soviets have agreed to that, and the Secretary noted he would be addressing
                        the issue concretely. The Soviets believe the matter is now up to the U.S.
                        side.</p>
                    <pb n="568" facs="0599" xml:id="pg_568"/>
                    <p>16. Afghanistan—U.S. response. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> said we have the topic under active
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>17. South Atlantic. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>
                        affirmed that the Soviet Union is not involved in developments in the South
                        Atlantic, but this does not mean it is indifferent to what is going on in
                        the region. The conflict around the Falklands/Malvinas is becoming
                        increasingly dangerous due to British actions, he said, and creates a threat
                        to peace and international security. The Soviet Union will determine its
                        policy on this issue accordingly, including its policy in the United
                        Nations. It believes that attempts to draw the issue into the context of
                        East-West relations serve no useful purpose either for Soviet-American
                        relations or for settlement of the conflict.</p>
                    <p>18. South Atlantic—U.S. response. In reply <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> read and presented <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> with the text of a non-paper (text at
                        conclusion of this message).</p>
                    <p>19. South Atlantic—discussion of Cuban role. With regard to the Cuban aspect
                        mentioned in the U.S. non-paper, <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said he had two comments:</p>
                    <p>—If the U.S. is concerned with or has problems with Cuban activities, this
                        should be the subject of discussions with the Cubans. (<persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> interjected that they are well
                        aware of our views.)</p>
                    <p>—Did the U.S. have facts, evidence, indications concerning Cuban involvement?
                        These would be useful in clarification. <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> replied that we have clear indications the Cubans would
                        like to become involved. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>
                        said he would transmit the U.S. demarche to Moscow but concluded by urging
                        the U.S. again to talk to the Cubans directly if it had problems.</p>
                    <p>20. Southern Africa. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>
                        affirmed that from what the Secretary had said concerning a settlement it
                        follows that the U.S. side sees a resolution of the Namibia problem to be
                        gained by imposed conditions unacceptable to <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>—the only legitimate representative of the Namibian
                        people—through the contact group (<gloss target="#t_CG_1">CG</gloss>). There
                        is no ground whatsoever, in the Soviet view, for the <gloss target="#t_CG_1">CG</gloss> to determine precisely what serves the interests of the
                        Namibian people, as is the case with the proposed electoral system. <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> has presented clear and unambiguous
                        reasons why such a system cannot be accepted, and they are fully supported
                        by the Front-Line states. The Soviet Union shares the <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> position, but it resolutely rejects
                        the charge that the <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> position
                        resulted from Soviet influence.</p>
                    <p>21. If the U.S. efforts are reduced to safeguarding the interests of only one
                        side in a settlement, <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>
                        continued, that approach has no promise. And the Soviets cannot be expected
                        to contribute. The Soviets have given the U.S. their views on how to achieve

                        also to assure the security of Angola. They have not yet received an answer,
                        although one was promised after AS <persName corresp="#p_CCA_1">Crocker</persName>’s trip to Africa. The question therefore arises as
                        to whether Washington is still interested in a dialogue with the Soviets
                        once favored by the U.S. side too.</p>
                    <p>22. Speaking personally, <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>
                        said the basic issue is that the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> talk
                        made clear the U.S. blames the Soviet Union for <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>’s rejection of the electoral proposal, and this is simply
                        not true.</p>
                    <p>23. Southern Africa—U.S. response. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> said that in general we are interested in
                        continuing our contacts and discussions on Southern Africa; we want to stay
                        in dialogue. Neither the U.S. nor the contact group has any idea of imposing
                        a system in Namibia. We had made some proposals. <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> had not accepted them, and this was regrettable because
                        they were reasonable proposals. We are now considering next steps with
                        regard to procedures. But our intention is to agree with <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>, and not to impose anything. We are
                        also working within the context of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        resolution. We have made progress in bringing the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> along; our approach is not one-sided. We want a solution,
                        and we hope the Soviets also have a favorable attitude toward one.</p>
                    <p>24. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said the Soviets had
                        seen reports of <persName corresp="#p_CCA_1">Crocker</persName>’s discussion
                        with South African officials in Geneva and the <gloss target="#t_CG_1">CG</gloss> meeting in Paris, and reports that we were proceeding with
                        “stage II” even though “stage I” is not completed. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> replied that these issues were
                        still under consideration, and that more information could be made available
                        by <persName corresp="#p_CCA_1">Crocker</persName> or by <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName>; we would be glad to be in touch.</p>
                    <p>25. Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said he
                        wished to discuss one issue not treated in the May 7 <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> meeting, and draw the Secretary’s attention to the
                        “aggravating” situation in the Middle East, especially in Lebanon. The
                        danger of an explosion there is growing, and it still has the same source:
                        Israel. If urgent measures are not taken the situation could get out of
                        control with unpredictable consequences. The U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> acting together could do a lot to
                        prevent it.</p>
                    <p>26. Middle East—discussion. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>
                        asked if the Soviets had anything specific in mind. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said they do not; rather the
                        whole area is cause for concern, and we could do important things together.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> said the U.S. is also
                        concerned and sees the situation as dangerous. We do not accept the
                        statement that Israel is the source; the situation is much more complicated.
                        We are communicating with all parties and urging restraint and respect for
                        the ceasefire. In general it is being observed. We agree the situation is
                        dangerous, and all parties should work to emphasize to the parties involved
                        that restraint is necessary. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> noted that one reason why the ceasefire is
                        holding, however precariously, is <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>
                        restraint in face of Israeli raids.</p>
                    <p>27. U.S.-Soviet summit. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>
                        said the Soviet side had noted the Secretary’s explanations, on the
                        President’s instruction, con<pb n="570" facs="0601" xml:id="pg_570"/>cerning
                        a summit. They understand the President also believes it advisable to hold a
                        thorough, full-scale meeting with careful prior preparation. The U.S. side
                        is also aware of the Soviet suggestions on timing and venue for such a
                        meeting. The Soviets consider it is up to the U.S. to say the next word.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> said we are considering
                        the question, and will be back in touch in due course.</p>
                    <p>28. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> meeting at <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_SSOD_1">SSOD</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> asked whether <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> had anything to say concerning this
                        possibility. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said the
                        Soviets had registered the Secretary’s remarks on television May 23 that the
                        U.S. side welcomed the prospect. However, he had nothing at the moment
                        concerning the composition of the Soviet <gloss target="#t_SSOD_1">SSOD</gloss> delegation. He would pass on our comment to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and be back as soon as he had a
                        reply. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName> confirmed that we
                        would welcome such a meeting, and invited <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> to be in touch when he had further
                        information.</p>
                    <p>29. U.S. non-paper on the Falklands. Begin text:</p>
                    <p>Recent events in the South Atlantic crisis are of great concern to the United
                        States Government and to all other governments which seek a peaceful
                        resolution of the dispute. The intensification of military operations in the
                        South Atlantic has already imposed a high human cost on both Argentina and
                        the United Kingdom. We are also concerned that the conflict may widen, thus
                        raising broader implications for peace and security in the region and
                        globally.</p>
                    <p>As has been made clear in previous contacts with the Soviet side, our
                        objective throughout the crisis has been to bring the conflict to a peaceful
                        resolution at the earliest possible time with minimum loss of life and
                        property. This was the basis of the mediation effort undertaken by Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>, and the U.S. support of
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council Resolution 502. At
                        the same time, our policy has been based on the principle that the first use
                        of force is not a legitimate means of resolving international disputes. We
                        continue to believe that this approach can serve as the basis of an
                        international agreement to bring hostilities to a close and assist the
                        parties in moving toward a negotiated resolution of their differences. The
                        United States Government will continue to do everything in its power to
                        achieve that objective.</p>
                    <p>In our view the South Atlantic crisis is not an East-West issue. At the same
                        time, we have communicated with the Soviet side in order to ensure that
                        there is no misunderstanding of our position. As we have previously made
                        clear, involvement by the Soviet Union in the South Atlantic crisis would
                        further inflame the situation and would have the most serious and
                        far-reaching impact on the entire range of our bilateral relations.</p>
                    <p>We have discussed our concerns over Cuban activities in the hemisphere and
                        beyond. The Soviet Union is aware that Cuban activities <pb n="571" facs="0602" xml:id="pg_571"/>have serious implications for our bilateral
                        relations. It should thus be clear that involvement by Cuba in the crisis
                        would raise grave dangers and have a severe impact on efforts to achieve a
                        more stable and productive bilateral relationship.</p>
                    <p>The Cuban Government should be made to understand that if it takes actions
                        with regard to the Falklands dispute that are inimical to our interests, the
                        United States will act as necessary to protect those interests. End

                    <p>On June 2, 1982, President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Ronald
                            Reagan</persName> flew to Paris, where he attended the Versailles <gloss target="#t_G7_1">G–7</gloss> Summit from June 4 to 6. On the morning of
                        June 7, 1982, President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> flew
                        from Paris to Rome, where he met with Pope John Paul II. That evening, he
                        flew from Rome to London, where he met with British Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TM_1">Margaret Thatcher</persName>, Queen Elizabeth II, and
                        delivered a speech to the British Parliament. (Reagan Library, President’s
                        Daily Diary)</p>
                    <p>In his speech to Parliament at Westminster, June 8, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> paraphrased former British Prime
                        Minister Winston Churchill: “From Stettin on the Baltic to Varna on the
                        Black Sea, the regimes planted by totalitarianism have had more than 30
                        years to establish their legitimacy. But none—not one regime—has yet been
                        able to risk free elections.” He went on to cite the Soviet invasion of
                        Afghanistan and support for martial law in Poland. “In an ironic sense Karl
                        Marx was right,” <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> went on to
                        say. “We are witnessing today a great revolutionary crisis, a crisis where
                        the demands of the economic order are conflicting directly with those of the
                        political order. But the crisis is happening not in the free, non-Marxist
                        West, but in the home of the Marxist-Leninism, the Soviet Union. It is the
                        Soviet Union that runs against the tide of history by denying human freedom
                        and human dignity to its citizens. It also is in deep economic difficulty.
                        The rate of growth in the national product has been steadily declining since
                        the fifties and is less than half of what it was then.” <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> cited several other examples of the
                        lackluster economic performance of Communist countries. (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                  </hi>,
                        1982, volume I, pages 742–748)</p>
                    <p>While the United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies
                        supported nuclear arms reductions talks, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> commented that did not mean they accepted the
                        permanence of Communist governments: “Some argue that we should encourage
                        democratic change in <pb n="573" facs="0604" xml:id="pg_573"/>right-wing
                        dictatorships, but not in Communist regimes. Well, to accept this
                        preposterous notion—as some well-meaning people have—is to invite the
                        argument that once countries achieve a nuclear capability, they should be
                        allowed an undisturbed reign of terror over their own citizens. We reject
                        this course.” The President then outlined an agenda to promote freedom and
                        democracy. “What I am describing now is a plan and a hope for the long

                        the ash-heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which stifle the
                        freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people.” He concluded the
                        speech with a call for a “crusade for freedom that will engage the faith and
                        fortitude of the next generation,” and movement “toward a world in which all
                        people are at last free to determine their own destiny.” (Ibid.) <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s Westminster speech is scheduled

                    <p>On June 9, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> flew from London to
                        Bonn, where he met Federal Republic of Germany Chancellor Helmut Schmidt,
                        addressed the Bundestag, and attended a meeting of the North Atlantic
                        Council. On June 11, he flew from Bonn to West Berlin and back, before

                        though that Israel had invaded Lebanon. I’m afraid we are faced with a real

                        President of the United States of America</p>
                    <p>I deem it essential to turn to you in connection with the very dangerous
                        situation in Lebanon and its vicinity.<note n="2" xml:id="d178fn2">On June
                            6, Israeli troops invaded Lebanon.</note> Israel is continuing large
                        scale aggression against a sovereign country, a member of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. Blood is being shed, thousands of people
                        are tragically perishing, the peaceful population of the country—Lebanese,
                        Palestinians—are experiencing unbelievable suffering.</p>
                    <p>In essence, Israel is pursuing a regular war against Lebanon. Israel began
                        this war with an act unprecedented in its impudence and contempt for the
                        norms of the international community: its troops have crossed the lines of
                        the armed forces of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, by this act
                        demonstratively trampling the flag of this organization. Israel continues
                        and intensifies its aggression, despite the unanimously adopted resolution
                        of the Security Council demanding the termination of military actions and
                        the immediate and unconditional removal of Israeli troops from the territory
                        of Lebanon.</p>
                    <p>In this manner there has been created an intolerable and most dangerous
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>The Israeli assault places in doubt the fate of Lebanon as an independent and
                        unitary state. The actions of Israel which directly threaten the security of
                        other Arab states are pregnant with (the possibility) of a further spread of
                        the crisis situation, the broadening of the military conflict and the
                        involvement in it of other countries. This is a fact which no one can
                        escape.</p>
                    <p>The situation which has arisen in this region demands the adoption without
                        delay of measures to carry into practice the resolution of the Security
                        Council. It is the duty of states, and, above all, of the permanent members
                        of the Security Council, effectively to apply themselves to this task.
                        Israel must know that it cannot count on anyone’s tolerance and support.</p>
                    <pb n="575" facs="0606" xml:id="pg_575"/>
                    <p>I turn to you Mr. President in view of the well-known fact that the United
                        States has at its disposal major possibilities of influencing Israel. This,
                        of course, places on the United States a particular responsibility for the
                        termination of aggression against Lebanon and the removal of Israeli troops
                        from its territory.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the events in Lebanon and its vicinity I must state: The
                        Soviet Union watches with utmost attention developments of the situation in
                        this region which is located in the immediate proximity of our southern
                        borders and where we have no shortage of friends. You will understand me
                        correctly, Mr. President, if you proceed on the assumption that the Soviet
                        Union will act in accordance with this and be guided by the interests of
                        Soviet and international security.</p>
                    <p>It cannot be denied that unless the war of Israel against Lebanon and the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> is immediately stopped the
                        consequences may prove unpredictable. We expect the United States to
                        undertake active steps to have Israel without delay stop its aggression and
                        fulfill the decision of the Security Council.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I have carefully studied your message of June 9 on the situation in
                        Lebanon.</p>
                    <p>We are as concerned as you are at developments there, and I agree that the
                        situation is grave. Our position is clear. Like the Soviet Union, <pb n="576" facs="0607" xml:id="pg_576"/>the United States voted for United
                        Nations Security Council Resolutions 508 and 509.<note n="2" xml:id="d179fn2">U.N. Resolution 508, June 5, called for a cease-fire
                            between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization in Lebanese
                            territory. U.N. Resolution 509, June 6, called for Israeli forces to
                            withdraw from Lebanon.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>In that regard, I have just learned that there has been a major escalation in
                        the fighting between Israeli and Syrian forces. I have, therefore, called on
                        the parties to agree to a ceasefire to take effect at 6:00 a.m. local
                        (Lebanese) time, June 10. I urge you to use your strong influence on Syria,
                        as I am using my influence in Israel, to bring about immediate acceptance of
                        that proposal.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName>, during earlier
                        extensive discussions with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BM_2">Begin</persName>, made abundantly clear to the Government of Israel
                        that in the view of the United States:</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>—Hostilities must cease forthwith,</p>
                        <p>—Every effort must be made to avoid escalating the current hostilities
                            and widening the conflict,</p>
                        <p>—Israeli forces must be withdrawn from Lebanon,</p>
                        <p>—The unilateral use of force to change the situation in the area is
                            unacceptable.</p>
               </quote>
                    <p>But it is also clear, Mr. President, that Israel is not prepared to accept a
                        restoration of the previous pattern of aggression against its northern
                        territories—an objective that we fully understand and with which we
                        sympathize.</p>
                    <p>As you may know, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> is
                        now in Damascus for discussions with Syrian leaders to clarify the situation
                        and urge restraint and the acceptance of my proposal for a ceasefire.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, Mr. President, I am compelled to point out that your
                        government bears no little responsibility for the current crisis in the
                        Middle East by its failure to support the Camp David Accords and its
                        readiness to furnish a steady supply of weapons to <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> forces in Lebanon. While we use our inflence to restrain
                        Israel, we expect your government to exercise its influence over the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>, Syria and your other friends in the area
                        in the same direction.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President, We have received your reply of 9 June.<note n="2" xml:id="d180fn2">See <ref target="#d179">Document 179</ref>.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>Developments in and around Lebanon, including those in the last few hours,
                        indicate that the situation is becoming more and more dangerous. This
                        compels me to turn to you. Israel’s aggression continues to widen, Israeli
                        troops have captured a considerable portion of Lebanese territory. They are
                        advancing on Beirut—the capital of a sovereign state. The number of victims
                        among the peaceful population, Lebanese and Palestinians, is increasing.
                        Facts indicate that the Israeli invasion is a previously planned operation,
                        which the U.S. must have known about.</p>
                    <p>No attempts to mitigate the aggressive nature of Israel’s actions can help to
                        justify them. Even less can the U.S. actions, like the imposition of a veto
                        on the Security Council Resolution of 8 June 1982 aid in halting the
                        aggression.</p>
                    <p>As we warned, the conflict is spreading. Israel’s intervention is provoking
                        an answering reaction from Syrian forces. We must be aware that the conflict
                        is becoming wider and wider and can flare up even more. The fact that more
                        than a hundred aircraft from both sides are taking part simultaneously in
                        air battles is indicative of this.</p>
                    <p>You write that you are also concerned with the development of events. In this
                        connection, I must repeat the main thought of my previous appeal. Urgent and
                        concrete, especially concrete, actions are needed to halt Israeli aggression
                        and to extinguish the war.</p>
                    <p>There is a reliable basis for this. It is the resolution of the United
                        Nations Security Council to which you yourself refer, and which demands a
                        halt to military actions and the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of
                        Israeli forces from the territory of Lebanon. If you firmly seek the
                        implementation of these resolutions and do not seek any sort of obstructive
                        measures (the U.S. representative in this region is resorting to such
                        measures, it must be noted), then a solution can and will be found.</p>
                    <p>I see no use in getting involved in polemics when it is a question of such
                        seriousness for international security. I only note that attempts <pb n="578" facs="0609" xml:id="pg_578"/>to shift responsibility for the
                        crisis situation in the Near East upon the Soviet Union are futile. We have
                        sought and continue to seek the establishment of a durable peace in this
                        region, and the attainment of a comprehensive and just settlement.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, I will tell you frankly that whether Israel finally begins to
                        implement the Security Council resolution depends primarily on the position
                        of the United States.</p>

                    <p>Soviet Embassy First Secretary Gennadiy Domakhin recently asked a former
                        senior-level U.S. official who is a Soviet affairs expert to tell U.S.
                        officials that the Soviets are unsure of the President’s interests and
                        intentions regarding the upcoming summit. Domakhin predicted that if the
                        President intends to use the summit as a vehicle for a message similar to
                        that he presented in London, the summit would be a debacle. Domakhin
                        added:</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>• If the President wants to strengthen U.S.-Soviet accord, a Moscow
                            summit and Soviet television for the summit are likely. Even if the
                            summit is held in a neutral location, Soviet television would be
                            available for the President.</p>
                        <p>• The President would gain credibility in Soviet eyes if he takes a more
                            conciliatory approach.</p>
               </quote>
                    <p>In response to a question, Domakhin said <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s attendance at the summit “at this point is
                        certain,” but without elaboration he noted the possibility of an “historical
                        accident” precluding <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                        attendance.</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>• Domakhin implied that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s attendance might be contingent upon what
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s summit
                            objectives are, and perhaps even upon the line the President takes in
                            Bonn and Berlin.</p>
                        <pb n="579" facs="0610" xml:id="pg_579"/>
                        <p>• The source doubts the latter, but feels perhaps the reality of
                                <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> being at the summit
                            is in doubt and certainly the reality of a positive outcome is in
                            doubt.</p>
               </quote>
                    <p>Domakhin expressed much interest in the possibility of a joint U.S.-Soviet
                        “action” to insure Lebanon’s integrity. (S)</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Given the tenuous ceasefire in Lebanon, I recommend that you respond promptly
                        to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s June 10 letter<note n="2" xml:id="d182fn2">See <ref target="#d180">Document
                            180</ref>.</note> to you on the crisis. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s letter was moderate in tone and lacked any hint
                        of threat or bluster. In this sense, it was more restrained than his June 9
                        letter to you,<note n="3" xml:id="d182fn3">See <ref target="#d178">Document
                                178</ref>.</note> despite the heavy losses incurred by Syria since
                        the first letter was written.</p>
                    <p>We cannot assume that the relatively restrained content and tone of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s correspondence with you during
                        the crisis conveys any weakening of Soviet resolve to support Syria. Indeed,
                        I believe that we can expect a Soviet effort to replace Syrian combat losses
                        to begin almost immediately. It is nonetheless striking that the Soviets did
                        so little to assist their Syrian allies and <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> clients over the past few days. They did not mount a major
                        resupply effort, nor were there any dramatic changes in the readiness status
                        of Soviet forces in the area or in the Soviet Union itself. Even Soviet
                        rhetoric lacked any hint of threats to Israel or the U.S. and any Soviet
                        commitment to assist their beleaguered friends. The net result can only be
                        described as a major setback to Soviet prestige and objectives in the Middle
                        East. The Soviets can be expected to begin immediately to repair the damage
                        to their position.</p>

                    <p>The draft reply stresses that continuance of the ceasefire depends upon
                        restraint by all parties and that the Soviets have a responsibility to use
                        their influence with Syria and the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>

                    <p>2. Begin text: Dear Mr. President: I have carefully considered your letter of
                        June 10.<note n="2" xml:id="d183fn2">See <ref target="#d180">Document
                                180</ref>.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>3. As you know, at my urging the Israeli Government announced June 11 that
                        Israeli forces in Lebanon would observe a ceasefire from 12:00 p.m. that
                        day. Unfortunately, fighting between <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>
                        and Israeli forces continued. My government went, again, to the Israelis
                        urging restraint. This approach resulted in a new Israeli ceasefire—agreed
                        to by the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>—to go into effect at 9:00
                        p.m. (Lebanese time) June 12.</p>
                    <p>4. This decision by the Government of Israel is a constructive step that
                        could result in a halt to the conflict in Lebanon which has raised such
                        grave dangers to peace throughout the region. Obviously, the <pb n="581" facs="0612" xml:id="pg_581"/>maintenance of the ceasefire depends upon
                        restraint by all parties to the conflict. I shall continue to use my
                        influence with Israel to that end; I expect that you will urge similar
                        restraint on Syria and the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>5. The ceasefire is only a first step toward a lasting solution of the
                        problems which are at the root of the recent tragic events in Lebanon. My
                        government will continue to work for the implementation of Security Council
                        Resolutions 508 and 509, and the creation of political arrangements which
                        will ensure the independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon under an
                        effective central government. The maintenance of peace will also require
                        that Israel be assured that attacks on its Northern territories originating
                        in Lebanon not be resumed.</p>
                    <p>6. My personal representative in the area, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Philip Habib</persName>, will continue his contacts
                        with all concerned parties, including the Governments of Israel, Syria, and
                        Lebanon with a view to working out such arrangements. In this connection, I
                        must reject emphatically the suggestion in your letter that Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName>’s activities in the area
                        have obstructed the search for peace. Indeed, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> has carried out his difficult
                        mission with distinction, and his efforts to assist the parties in the
                        search for peace will continue.</p>
                    <p>7. I agree with you that polemics should have no place in our exchanges at
                        any time—but particularly during this critical period. However, your letter
                        contains the allegation which has also appeared in the Soviet media that the
                        U.S. Government had been aware of the Israeli attack in advance. This charge
                        is totally without foundation; thus, in keeping with your own view of
                        polemics, it has no appropriate place in communications between us.</p>
                    <p>8. In closing, I wish to reiterate that my government will continue its
                        energetic efforts to advance the cause of a just and lasting peace in the
                        Middle East. Sincerely, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Ronald

                            177</ref>.</note> For several months now Soviet experts on the U.S. have
                        lulled the Kremlin into believing that you have fundamentally softened your
                        stance toward the Soviet Union and Communism, adopting a “pragmatic” line
                        that in all but name is identical with <hi rend="italic">detente</hi>. In so
                        doing, they were largely victims of the U.S. media on which they rely for
                        insights into our politics. The uncompromising and philosophical tone of
                        your speech proved, therefore, a grave shock to the Kremlin, placing it in a
                        quandary as to what sort of a response to adopt. Here are some
                        illustrations:</p>
                    <quote>
                  <p>—In its initial reaction <gloss target="#t_TASS_1">TASS</gloss> could
                            not even get itself to admit that you were talking about communism,
                            saying instead that you contrasted “the West” with that “part of the
                            world where power is in the hands of the people”(!).</p>
                        <p>—Our Moscow Embassy reports that numerous Soviet contacts have raised the
                            issue of the London speech. A senior <hi rend="italic">Izvestiia</hi>
                            correspondent referred to Soviet criticism leveled at your speech as the
                            harshest since your inauguration. <hi rend="italic">Time Magazine</hi>
                            correspondent in Moscow, Strobe Talbott, was told by a high Central
                            Committee official that your London speech was not “ideological warfare”
                            but a declaration of intent to “destroy” the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> (Tab A).<note n="3" xml:id="d184fn3">Attached but not

               </quote>
                    <p>All this indicates how extremely vulnerable Moscow is to a bold ideological
                        challenge, and how panically afraid of it. Lest, however, it be able to
                        misinterpret your challenge to be not ideological but military (as it has
                        been doing already), it is very important that in your future speeches on
                        the subject you stress that what you have in mind is, indeed, “ideological
                        competition”. This might be accomplished in the context of a speech in which
                        you spell out your Soviet policy and <pb n="583" facs="0614" xml:id="pg_583"/>propose concrete steps the Soviet leadership needs to take internally and
                        externally in order to earn a more sympathetic attitude from the U.S. Given
                        the evident disarray in Moscow, such an address may help tip the scales in
                        favor of more realistic elements in the Soviet leadership. (S)</p>

                            18</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and I will meet Friday
                        afternoon and, if we decide we need more time, again Saturday morning. I
                        expect to find <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> in a
                        complaining mood following your successful European trip and the beating the
                        Syrians and <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> have taken in Lebanon. The
                        meeting is therefore likely to be a sober affair with few if any immediate
                        results.</p>
                    <p>It is nevertheless an important opportunity to register the essential
                        continuity of our overall approach to the Soviets at a moment when the
                        spotlight is on arms control. The full scope of your negotiating program is
                        now on display, and we have the high ground. But I also want to use this
                        meeting to make clear to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that
                        the Soviets are not off the hook with regard to the agenda of regional
                        concerns we have set before them: Poland, Afghanistan, southern Africa,
                        Central America and Kampuchea.</p>
                    <p>The message, once again, will be that the constructive East-West relations we
                        want are not possible without serious adjustments in Soviet behavior on
                        these issues. In particular, I will want to probe for openings toward
                        progress concerning Poland, where the situation remains unstable. In the
                        same spirit, I plan to suggest intensified bilateral discussions of what it
                        would take to achieve political solutions in Afghanistan and in southern
                        Africa. Explaining to the Soviets our policy on southern Africa seems to me
                        particularly important at this point, since we are entering a critical phase
                        on Namibia/Angola and need to deprive them of the excuse that they were
                        unaware of what we are <pb n="584" facs="0615" xml:id="pg_584"/>doing. On
                        the Middle East, I will be responding to—and deflecting—<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s complaints.</p>
                    <p>On arms control, I will take advantage of your initiatives and Alliance
                        support for your negotiating program to put <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> on the defensive, building on your UNSSOD speech.
                        The message will be that we have a sensible and comprehensive program for
                        negotiating improved security for both sides through significant reductions;
                        that the Soviets cannot be serious when they accuse us of not being sincere;
                        and that it is up to them to demonstrate in negotiations that they really
                        favor arms control.</p>
                    <p>I do not plan to raise a possible meeting between you and <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> myself, because it is important at
                        this point that we not appear anxious to get to the summit. When <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> raises it, as he almost certainly
                        will, I will make very clear that we do not favor the kind of summit without
                        substance that has occurred in the past, and will therefore be looking for
                        real progress on our agenda as we assess the prospects of a summit in the
                        months ahead.</p>

                        the Foreign Minister, and said that since he was the host at this meeting,
                        it was <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s turn to make the
                        opening remarks, and he would listen with interest to anything that
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had to say. He hoped that
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would be open and
                        frank.</p>

                        indicated that he thought the structure of the conversation could be such
                        that he would speak in short passages rather than long ones and that this
                        would be better and more natural. If he were to give very long
                        presentations, then <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> would want
                        to reply in even longer ones since the Americans always like to be first; so
                        this would be a more rational approach.</p>

                  </hi> replied
                        that the US side tended to lag behind in such exchanges, and would try to
                        catch up. He quipped that this leads to increased tensions.</p>
                    <p>

                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> said he
                        would like to start by asking one question, namely in which direction the
                        policy of the present US Administration was directed—toward peace or toward
                        war or preparation for war? He thought that it was difficult to contest that
                        at the present time this was the main question of interest to people,
                        governments, and most nations, that is, the question of whether peace can be
                        preserved or whether mankind will fall into the abyss of a new war. He hoped
                        that <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> did not consider this too
                        direct a question, since the Soviet side considered that it was better to be
                        direct than to take a zig-zag path, wherein one scratches the left ear with
                        the right hand or vice versa. He wanted <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> to answer not in a purely formal way but in a
                        substantive way.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                  </hi> replied
                        that, as is frequently the case, the Minister gets immediately to the point,
                        and this is a good way to begin. It is clear that the President of the
                        United States feels strongly that it is imperative for the nuclear
                        superpowers to establish a framework for peace and stability. However, the
                        experience of the past decade left not only the President, but also the
                        American people and other countries of the world, with the strong feeling
                        that atmospherics, slogans and similar things mean little when actions are
                        taken that threaten peace. The President has set a special agenda in the
                        search for more positive relations with the Soviet Union. As two superpowers
                        we have a major burden to bear. We must be judged not by our dedication to
                        slogans, but by our actions.</p>
                    <p>In the two previous meetings on this level, the US spoke of what <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> considered and the President also
                        considered unsettling policies on the Soviet side.<note n="2" xml:id="d186fn2">See <ref target="#d90">Documents 90</ref>, <ref target="#d91">91</ref>, <ref target="#d137">137</ref>, and <ref target="#d138">138</ref>.</note> But a great deal remains to be
                        desired with regard to actions. This is an important aspect in response to
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s question.</p>
                    <p>When the President wrote to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        about his aspirations he expressed this very clearly, and he remains clear
                        on this today. So <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> hoped that
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s response and his own
                        response would facilitate specific actions to improve the climate for
                        broader possibilities of peace and stability and the reduction of the levels
                        of armaments, which <pb n="586" facs="0617" xml:id="pg_586"/>would be of
                        mutual benefit for the whole spectrum of relations between our
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> stated
                        that he would like to stress the position of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the Soviet leadership with regard to the question
                        proposed and the reply given by <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>. He wished to emphasize that the Soviet Union has always
                        been and is interested in a policy of peace. The Soviet side, and <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> personally, have always indicated
                        a desire to have good relations with the US, and they had always followed
                        this general line both in their internal and external policies. Their policy
                        is a policy of peace. The actions they take are purely of a defensive
                        nature. The Soviet Union has no other aims, and will have no other aims. He
                        wished that the US Administration would understand this. He was saying this
                        in part because of what had been said by the US President.</p>
                    <p>He wanted to ask <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> a second
                        question about US policy. The Soviet side has a very definite opinion that
                        the US, especially the present Administration, has set as an important goal
                        the achievement of first place from the military point of view in the world.
                        Is this a correct assessment of American goals? The Soviets had gathered
                        this from US official statements.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                  </hi> said that
                        if we look back over the past 65 years, and examine the ideological
                        differences between the Marxist and Leninist ideology in their Soviet model,
                        on the one hand, and the capitalist and the market economy ideology in the
                        American model, on the other hand, we find that the offensive and aggressive
                        actions have always come from the East. President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> is a leader who believes in the
                        principle of reciprocity. So long as the struggle continues in ideological
                        terms, the rhetoric will be more inclined to point out our systematic
                        differences.</p>
                    <p>American aims remain as before—to have sufficient defensive military
                        capabilities to ensure that there is no incentive for disturbing the peace.
                        The US is not striving for superiority or advantage over the Soviet Union.
                        Indeed, the US currently has less than half the number of men under arms
                        than the Soviet Union has—two million as opposed to over four million men.
                        The US has fewer aircraft and less nuclear destructive power. In considering
                        the threat faced by the two sides, one can see a dangerous imbalance. No
                        American President can look upon Soviet policies as policies of peace.
                        Perhaps this can change in the future. Meanwhile the US wishes to assure
                        equity in the arms area, and an increase of US capabilities is now underway.
                        This can be adjusted from the point of view of arms control but only in the
                        context of some equitable changes in comparative systems and
                        capabilities.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> said
                        that the Soviet side had been watching American policies over many years and
                        what the US does in the area of arms buildup. It has especially been
                        watching the present Administration, which has openly said that the basis of
                        its foreign policy is to achieve <pb n="587" facs="0618" xml:id="pg_587"/>first place as a military power, and the US Administration has made
                        statements to the effect that the US way of life should be accepted by
                        everyone. He did not want to go too deeply into this and would say more
                        about it later. The Soviet side condemns the philosophy of any country
                        seeking to be first, including the superpowers. This is dangerous, since the
                        logic of life (especially with superpowers) indicates that other nations
                        cannot permit one power to become dominant. The US probably has people who
                        like to calculate economics and other things which support this goal of
                        being first. But if the US has such calculating people who are glad to see
                        such results of their calculations, they are very much mistaken, and the
                        Soviet side cannot agree with this approach. The Soviet Union has not set
                        such a goal for itself, i.e., to be the best nation—neither in theory, nor
                        in international affairs.</p>
                    <p>In the Soviet view, the basis of relations between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> should be the principle of equality and
                        equal security. This is the bedrock foundation on which our relations can be
                        built, maintained, and developed. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had said in passing that in the Soviet Union there are
                        more personnel in the armed forces than in the US, but <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> must know that the structure of the
                        Soviet military and the structure of the US military, as well as the
                        military structures of other countries, are not simply carbon copies of each
                        other. The US and the Soviet Union can make good and precise calculations in
                        defining the potential of both sides from the point of view of all of the
                        components involved. In this regard, the two sides have military parity,
                        which is tantamount to saying that there is military parity between the
                        Warsaw Pact and <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. He wished to
                        emphasize that the Soviet side cannot depart from this principle and all
                        hopes that the Soviet Union will tire of listening to all the speeches
                        against it, or will be frightened by this, rest on sand. He wished to say
                        these things to <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> especially in
                        view of the very important negotiations coming up, i.e., continuation of the
                        talks regarding nuclear armaments in Europe and strategic arms. During the
                        negotiations and before them it is very important to know the positions of
                        principle of both partners. This makes it easier to go forward.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes the US has accepted the position that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the US should build their relations on the basis of
                        equality and equal security, and the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        II treaty (in which <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had been
                        personally involved on occasion) was based on this principle. But now we are
                        to believe that during the Administrations of Ford, <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>, and Nixon, the mathematics of the
                        situation was not properly understood. Can the Soviet Union seriously accept
                        that past US Administrations made a serious mistake in its mathematics and
                        the present one knows mathematics better, and is correcting the mistake? No,
                        it cannot. Any reasonable person would say that this is not possible, and
                        that such an approach reflects a change of political aims.</p>
                    <pb n="588" facs="0619" xml:id="pg_588"/>
                    <p>So it would be good if the US really had a policy of peace and the intention
                        to build relations with other countries on the basis of peace, and if it
                        returned to this principle as the basis for negotiations, confirming it by
                        concluding an appropriate agreement. Then it would be easier to live, to
                        build relations between the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the
                        US, and it would be easier for other countries. It would be easier for the
                        world to breathe.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                  </hi> indicated
                        that they had been through similar discussions in past meetings, and that he
                        knew the Minister would recall our conviction that arms control such as
                            <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> or INF or, for conventional
                        weapons, <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss>, must inevitably proceed
                        from the premise of equity. But the basis of our relations consists of a
                        mosaic which goes beyond the general criterion of equal security and equity.
                        There has been a continuing pattern of Soviet arms build-up which has
                        contributed to a reassessment of military levels. But perhaps the most
                        serious aspect of our relations, if we assess the past decade, is the
                        deterioration of equality and equal security, and of the basic principles of
                        relations agreed to between our countries at the beginning of the
                        1970’s—i.e., not to take unfair advantage of each other in the conduct of
                        our mutual affairs. Immediately after that agreement, there was an alarming
                        number of Soviet violations of the basic principles of international
                        behavior. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had had a great deal
                        of experience in Vietnam, when the US tried to get the Soviet Union to
                        influence Hanoi, but without success. Only after the US escalated the
                        conflict was an agreement reached, and then it was ruthlessly violated by
                        Hanoi with arms furnished to it by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. That was followed by Cuban troops in Angola, who were
                        brought there by Soviet resources. Then there was the expansion into
                        Ethiopia, and the events of the late 70’s, such as those in the Yemens. The
                        Soviet Union then became involved in neutral (yet pro-Soviet) Afghanistan,
                        and subsequently interfered directly in Afghanistan. During all of this, the
                        US did nothing to increase its influence by military force or subversive
                        means.</p>
                    <p>This week Mr. Rodriguez stated in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> that
                        Cuba’s arms have doubled in the past few years.<note n="3" xml:id="d186fn3">Reference is to Cuban Vice President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, who
                            addressed the United Nations on June 16. (“Cuba Reports Getting ‛Huge’
                            Supply of Arms,” <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, June 17, 1982,
                            p. A11)</note> This has happened as a result of Soviet arms shipments,
                        despite what was said by the US over the past 18 months. President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> and all Americans have been greatly
                        influenced by the bitter experiences of the past decade, and by the size of
                        the Soviets arms buildup.</p>
                    <p>After the era of detente, Soviet arms have increased by 4–5 percent every
                        year, while American arms were steadily decreasing until the last year of
                        the <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> Administration and the
                        first year of the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                        <pb n="589" facs="0620" xml:id="pg_589"/>Administration. So if equity
                        existed in the early 70’s, the Soviet Union has now changed that situation,
                        and this is clearly an obstacle today in US-Soviet relations. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> wishes to reverse this
                        situation, but not because of a desire to be first. Any arms negotiations
                        based on such a principle would be sterile. Equity must be a basic
                        criterion. The problem has been that there have been great abuses on the
                        part of the Soviet Union. Over the past 18 months, during the two meetings
                        with Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and in the
                        meetings with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>,
                        the US tried to emphasize that the basis for US-Soviet relations must be
                        actions, not rhetoric. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had
                        spoken about Southern Africa, where the US has no desire and no reason to
                        increase its influence. No progress has been made in that area. The Soviet
                        Union has been an obstacle to progress. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had spoken about shipments of arms to Cuba, but no
                        precautions have been taken by the Soviets in this regard. The US had spoken
                        about the situation in Poland. It could be greatly improved as a result of
                        American economic assistance, but the Soviets have taken no steps to improve
                        the situation. Nothing has happened to improve matters in Afghanistan. All
                        of this is not equality. In all of this—arms or political, economic or
                        security relations—the imbalance which exists is a direct result of Soviet
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> would find it sterile to propose
                        to depart from the principle of equal security and equality, either in a
                        broad sense or in arms negotiations. But if equality existed in the 70’s,
                        during the period of detente, and in the agreements on basic principles of
                        relations, then it is the Soviet Union, and not the United States which has
                        flagrantly violated these principles.</p>

                        reduction of arms, and of disarmaments, specifically on the two questions of
                        nuclear arms in Europe and strategic arms.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> indicated that the question of
                        nuclear arms in Europe had been discussed for a long period of time. Our two
                        nations, as well <pb n="590" facs="0621" xml:id="pg_590"/>as many other
                        nations, have spoken out about this question, but as yet there has been no
                        agreement, and no results. Therefore, it would be desirable to compare the
                        positions of the two sides, and to examine future prospects. Of course he
                        and <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> would not go into the
                        details of this question, but would discuss it only in principle, since the
                        details would be left for discussion to the delegations in Geneva. However,
                        the specific data would hover in the background, like phantoms, helping in
                        the discussions.</p>
                    <p>The principle of equality should apply not only in the global sense to
                        US/USSR military relations, but should apply to Europe as well. So when we
                        speak of approximate equality between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, this applies to Europe, with one
                        reservation of which he would speak. Approximate equality in Europe between
                        the US (<gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>) and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> (Warsaw Pact), had not been contested by
                        the US until recently. These recent doubts have had no basis. Now, with
                        regard to the reservation of which he had spoken: there is now equality in
                        Europe from the point of view of arms materiel, but there is also a
                        geographical factor which favors the US, as the Soviet side had previously
                        mentioned. In actual fact the US has transferred a launching pad for its
                        strategic weapons from the US to Europe. And the US now wants a significant
                        increase in its potential on this launching pad by adding Pershing II and
                        cruise missiles. These are in actual fact strategic weapons and must be
                        taken into consideration. This is the first thing that he wanted to say.</p>
                    <p>The second thing involves the question of flight time, which exists whether
                        we like it or not. Both military specialists and political specialists must
                        take into consideration the use of weapons from US territory and Western
                        European territory, and the time parameters involved in both cases. If the
                        Soviet side were religious it would say that the whole world prays to all
                        the gods that this will not happen, but we must take this into
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>The nuclear weapons of England and France must be taken into account. It is
                        not acceptable to leave them out. It is not enough to say that these are
                        matters of prestige, and that they involve independent countries. For the
                        Soviet Union this is unimportant, and a loss of time to argue about it.</p>
                    <p>One other aspect should be taken into account. Although there is approximate
                        equality between <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw Pact,
                        even in terms of materiel, the US does have an advantage from the point of
                        the number of warheads, i.e., it has 50 percent more than the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. In number of delivery vehicles, there
                        is approximate equality, if comparable categories are considered.</p>
                    <p>Although the Soviet side did not know what proposals the US delegation in
                        Geneva would come up with in the future, the proposals which have been
                        presented not only do not form a basis for an agree<pb n="591" facs="0622" xml:id="pg_591"/>ment, but do not even form a basis for bringing the
                        positions of the two sides closer together. The Soviet proposals, on the
                        other hand, whether the US agrees with this or not (and the US has been
                        critical of them), are equitable. But the US proposals do not form a basis
                        for agreement. The US should be more objective in regards to the Soviet
                        proposals and in regard to all aspects of the relations of the strategic
                        arms of the two countries in Europe.</p>
                    <p>He knew that the US side was aware of the proposals made by <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Leonid Brezhnev</persName> concerning a moratorium,
                        Soviet SS–20’s and a freeze. There had been no discussion of these matters,
                        since the US side had not wished to discuss them in context with other
                        matters. This is unfortunate. The Soviet side would like to have the US give
                        these matters due attention.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet side has the impression that Washington has set its sights on
                        implementing its plan to place Pershing II and cruise missiles in Western
                        Europe, and that everything else is not very important. Would the US side
                        agree with such a conclusion?</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union wants to have agreement on nuclear arms in Europe and
                        considers it very important. Such an agreement would improve the situation
                        with regard to strategic arms as well.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                  </hi> said he
                        was sure that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> realized he had
                        been “counting beans” for many years, during five years as <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> commander, and long before that, when
                        questions of nuclear and conventional arms were addressed. He could not let
                        pass the statement that there was no contention on the existence of an arms
                        balance between East and West. One should examine this from an historical
                        perspective. For example, the West never sought to match Soviet and Warsaw
                        Pact conventional arms capabilities with equivalent Western conventional
                        capabilities. From the early days, the Western approach has been to
                        compensate for this by relying heavily not only on strategic weapons, but
                        also on theater weapons. As the Soviet capabilities in nuclear weapons began
                        to grow, the difference between East and West in this area began to
                        decrease. Before, there had been a period of “accepted” stability. The West
                        accepted its qualitative advantage as a compensation for the increase of
                        nuclear capabilities in the East.</p>
                    <p>But there has been a shift in the balance. There has been no compensation on
                        the part of the West in the area of conventional weapons. The Western levels
                        have stayed the same, and have tended to decrease after the crisis of the
                        1950’s, with the one exception of the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>.
                        When <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> went to Western Europe,
                        the situation had not changed. In the area of conventional weapons, the
                        Soviet Union had about a 2–1 advantage in in-place forward-deployed
                        divisions, a 3–1 advantage in tanks, a 4–1 advantage in artillery, and a 2–1
                        advantage in aircraft. In the area of aircraft, the Soviet side had
                        increased the number of new dual-<pb n="592" facs="0623" xml:id="pg_592"/>capability aircraft made available to the Warsaw Pact. Those imbalances
                        are roughly the same today. This is in reply to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement that there was never any contention on
                        this issue.</p>
                    <p>In 1975 the “bean-counting” in Europe became more intense as the Soviets
                        began increasing deployment of SS–20’s and dual-capable Warsaw Pact fighters
                        and fighter-bombers. Alarms began to sound in Western circles, especially
                        military circles. By 1977, <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        calculations showed that in the area of nuclear delivery systems, the
                        pattern of superiority enjoyed by the West to offset Eastern superiority in
                        conventional weapons began to change. Such a situation still exists today.
                        As our experts have strongly indicated in Geneva, by any reasonable
                        calculation, the Soviet side has anywhere from a 3–1 to a 6–1 advantage, and
                        the disparity is being aggravated by the deployment of the extremely
                        destabilizing SS–20’s, which has been continuing since the mid-1970’s.
                        Moreover, the old S–4 and S–5 missiles, which the SS–20’s were designed to
                        replace, have not been removed. All in all, the Warsaw Pact has over 900
                        warheads in place, which is much greater than the number on the S–4’s and
                        S–5’s had been. Therefore, at the present time there is a very large
                        imbalance both with regard to conventional weapons and with regard to
                        nuclear weapons, where the West has at least a 3–1 disadvantage in nuclear
                        delivery vehicles.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> was well aware of the recent
                        Soviet proposal put forth in Geneva, and considered that it showed a measure
                        of good faith and flexibility, especially in the willingness of the Soviet
                        side to accept that SS–20’s east of the Urals are capable of hitting
                        European targets, and that depending on where they are located, they may be
                        considered strategic. It is clear that such weapons are strategic if one
                        looks at them from Paris, London, or Bonn. One of the advantages in
                        beginning the <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> negotiations lies in
                        the interrelation of theater and strategic forces. As the US assesses Soviet
                        bean-counting, some of the Western systems the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has mentioned will be shown as being counted twice in the
                            <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> talks. These systems might be
                        considered strategic.</p>
                    <p>At any rate, an important step forward has been made in initiating these
                        talks. The subject of bean-counting has posed difficulties in the past. It
                        has been dealt with in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, and a number of subjective
                        differences have been eliminated. This will be an important contribution in
                        the <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> talks. It will help to bring
                        the two sides closer together, and to avoid double jeopardy in counting.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> was not contesting what
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had mentioned in regard
                        to flight time for strategic weapons. The problem is that one cannot deal
                        with theater weapons without appropriate consideration of strategic weapons.
                        This problem will have to be addressed in due course.</p>
                    <p>Regarding <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>, Soviet official reaction
                        to US proposals have shown a certain misunderstanding, perhaps based upon a
                            misinterpre<pb n="593" facs="0624" xml:id="pg_593"/>tation of the
                        President’s public statements. In such public statements, the US has tried
                        to avoid going into the details of the <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> proposal, but has only given its broad framework. There
                        might be misinterpretations of the motives behind the proposal. In the first
                        place, it is a serious proposal, and not propaganda. There is a serious
                        desire to bring about significant reductions in the arsenals of both sides,
                        an equal reduction by both sides. The US insists on talking about the
                        warheads and launchers in the first phase because it wishes to build on the
                        experience of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II.</p>
                    <p>The charge has been made that this is a one-sided approach involving
                        reduction only by the Soviet side. This is not so. The US is also speaking
                        of reductions on its side, which are to be as dramatic as those on the
                        Soviet side. The US wishes to deal with those systems which are the most
                        destabilizing and which raise uncertainties regarding the intentions of the
                        two sides, thus creating a major threat to peace. The US does see reductions
                        by its side not only of the old systems, but new systems as well, similar to
                        those which are asked from the Soviet side. Aircraft are not excluded. The
                        U.S. sees reductions to equal levels of capabilities. It is not excluding
                        cruise missiles. It sees the possibility of reduction of cruise missile
                        levels under phased conditions.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> wished to make it very clear for
                        the record that he could not agree with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement that equality in the theater area had
                        never been contested. He could remember how President Nixon and <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> agonized until 4 o’clock in the
                        morning, and how he, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>, was on
                        the phone in Washington talking about submarines and various other
                        categories of weapons.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> was not pessimistic. Both sides
                        should not be rigid but should have an open mind. Some issues might quickly
                        be resolved. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> could barely
                        understand the feelings of the Soviet side about the weapons of the US
                        allies, but was even less understanding of statements about the existence of
                        equality. There is no equality. There is a 3–1 inequality at the very least,
                        involving such things as Warsaw Pact aircraft, which the East does not
                        count. But all of this will be better handled in the coming months.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> wished to assure <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and the Soviet leadership that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> is very serious
                        about arms control, and is not engaged in propaganda. The US feels that the
                        Soviet Union is engaged in propaganda. The US does not favor the idea of a
                        moratorium, since it considers that the West is in an inferior position and
                        would not want to solidify such a position. The US has rejected such a
                        moratorium and has publicly said so. Obviously the Soviet side can challenge
                        this, but the US is unconvinced.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> understood that the Soviet
                        leadership was disturbed over the non-ratification of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty. There was a great deal of <pb n="594" facs="0625" xml:id="pg_594"/>controversy in the US over that
                        treaty, and that controversy is what caused its collapse. The collapse was
                        not a reaction to Afghanistan, but was caused by the view that there were
                        inadequacies in the treaty itself.</p>
                    <p>Other areas where progress is possible also exist. One of these is the area
                        of verification, in which the US had noted the encouraging remarks of the
                        Soviet side.</p>
                    <p>A great challenge lies before us in our negotiations, but <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> was not pessimistic that solutions
                        could be found which would reduce the likelihood of nuclear conflict and
                        would relieve the tremendous economic burden posed by an arms buildup. Of
                        course, equality and equal security must form a basis for the negotiations.
                        At the same time, the US has not abandoned the concept of linkage, because
                        linkage is not a policy which can be simply adopted or rejected. Linkage is
                        a fact of life. If progress is not made in other areas, this necessarily
                        impacts on progress in the arms area. This is as clear as night follows day.
                        If the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> had doubts about US actions in
                        the Soviet sphere of concern, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        would also begin to apply pressure. This was not something that was
                        optional. Linkage has always existed and remains a fact.</p>

                        undertook actions which proved costly to the US and which had brought about
                        a great deal of tension. US-Soviet relations cannot be <pb n="595" facs="0626" xml:id="pg_595"/>examined without looking at the experience

                        future.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi>
                        indicated that he had listened carefully to what <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had said, and that he wished to refer
                        some questions to future discussion. For the moment, he wished to direct
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s attention to the question
                        of nuclear arms in Europe.</p>
                    <p>First of all, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had mentioned
                        conventional arms. The two of them should leave this question aside, since
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had only touched upon it in
                        passing, and they were not discussing this matter at present. There are
                        negotiations which deal with this. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is not afraid of any reproaches from the West. The Soviet
                        position is very clear. The Soviet side would like to reach agreement with
                        the West, but the West has other views. Nevertheless, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will be patient and will continue its
                        work. He noted that the US did not even say “thank you” for the Soviet
                        withdrawal of 1000 tanks and 20,000 troops from the <gloss target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss> to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, it cannot be contested that in the area of nuclear forces in
                        Europe, <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> (the US) and the Warsaw Pact
                            (<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>) have approximate equality in
                        the area of delivery vehicles, and that <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> had 50 percent more nuclear warheads.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, the US side is trying to change the dividing line defining
                        medium-range systems: it takes into consideration aircraft with a range of
                        less than 1,000, 900, 800, 700, 600 miles, sometimes calling these systems
                        intermediate, and then begins to compare. Why is this done? The US has
                        included some of the Soviet aircraft which do not carry nuclear weapons. The
                        US has been capricious in its estimates.</p>
                    <p>Fourthly, if this is the approach the US takes, not recognizing the dividing
                        line of medium-range aircraft—we should go further. We should include all
                        nuclear weapons, including tactical ones. The Soviet side would agree with
                        such an approach. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> has
                        indicated his approval for such an approach. But Washington has not reacted
                        positively to this. So the two sides should get away from various
                        combinations and artificial constraints of this kind. They should take a
                        scientific and mathematical approach, and take all factors into
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>Fifthly, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was glad to hear
                        that, although <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had been careful
                        in his remarks, he had nevertheless indicated that the US saw a certain
                        flexibility in the Soviet proposal made in Geneva and that it could be
                        helpful. The US side should look more closely at the proposal, and perhaps
                        it might see not only a sign of flexibility, but a basis for progress in the
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Sixthly, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> repeated that the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would like to see an agreement on
                        nuclear arms in Europe.</p>
                    <pb n="596" facs="0627" xml:id="pg_596"/>
                    <p>Seventh, US stationing of the Pershing II and cruise missiles would elicit a
                        very strong response and would sound a negative note for the situation in
                        Europe, the world, and US–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> relations.
                        The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would be forced to react
                        accordingly. Then Soviet proposals concerning a moratorium, our missiles
                        east of the Urals and a freeze would no longer be valid. The situation would
                        then be different and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would have
                        to think about how best to improve its security and that of its allies in
                        the Warsaw Pact. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would not permit
                        itself to be in an unfavorable position. It would protect its interests.</p>
                    <p>The US did not think that the Soviet Union had forgotten about other US plans
                        and possibilities in other regions of the world—not in strategic arms, but
                        in other areas of the world. He was thinking of medium or intermediate range
                        weapons, and how they could be dangerous to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. He was referring to what might be called the “beyond the
                        Ural” range. These weapons had not been included in the negotiations but the
                        Soviets might be forced into including them given certain situations. It
                        remains to be seen how such a “Ural” version develops, i.e., involving areas
                        like the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, and the ocean areas in the east of
                        the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would like to hope that the US
                        Administration could be more flexible in all this, realizing that the Soviet
                        Union would not like the US to be in a better position than it is. The
                        Soviet Union does not strive to have the upper hand with regard to nuclear
                        arms in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union does not want to make the US the underdog as a result of
                        negotiations or agreement. This was <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s reply to <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s comments and if <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had no other comments perhaps they could talk about
                        strategic arms and the principles which apply to them. Of course the two
                        delegations in Geneva will continue these talks, but if the basic principles
                        have been worked out, their work will be easier.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                  </hi> indicated
                        that he wanted to make a brief comment since he was disturbed by <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s last statement. The Minister
                        knows that it was the Soviet Union, and not the US, that deployed the
                        SS–20’s. The US has no comparable means to deal with this. There are more
                        than 900 warheads aimed at the West. A decision was made by the previous
                        administration to place Pershing II and cruise missiles in Western Europe.
                        This was not only a moderate reply but if recalculations are made due to the
                        continuing deployment of SS–20’s, the West will still be at a disadvantage
                        unless it can compensate for the measures taken by the Soviet side. Threats
                        about what the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will do if the West
                        does what it has decided to do as a result of Soviet actions are
                        counter-productive. If the Soviet Union were to compensate for these
                        measures, the West could do likewise. It would not want to, but it would be
                        ready to. If the West is forced to have a jousting match, it is ready to do
                        so. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> was hopeful that before
                        long the negotiations in <pb n="597" facs="0628" xml:id="pg_597"/>Geneva
                        would resolve these matters. The US intends to reduce, not increase nuclear
                        arms, but it is ready to deal with such a contingency if it arises.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> indicated puzzlement regarding
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s second reference
                        concerning other geographical areas for location of nuclear arms. Perhaps
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> could enlighten him about
                        this. It was hard for <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> to say
                        whether he was looking at the same thing that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was.</p>

                        that he was not proposing to add other questions to the European agenda. He
                        simply wished to say that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has not
                        lost sight of US plans to use nuclear weapons of various types which would
                        generally be considered medium-range weapons (such as cruise missiles)
                        against the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in certain areas. The US
                        has not said it will not use such weapons. He did not want to formally
                        broaden the agenda for this meeting, but simply to direct <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s attention to this question. Lack of
                        progress on nuclear weapons would be bad for everyone—the Soviet Union, the
                        United Nations, Europe and the world.</p>

                        of systems to be limited, i.e., warheads and launchers. The US is thinking
                        about a thirty percent reduction in these systems by both sides. The world
                        is waiting for such a step.</p>

                        that there is a lot of good will shown in the world concerning this

                    <p>The relation of the US Administration to strategic arms and nuclear arms in
                        Europe is clear. But perhaps the US has plans for nuclear arms which are not
                        strategic and which are not concentrated on Europe—i.e. they involve the
                        Indian Ocean, the Pacific, the Persian Gulf, etc. The systems involved might
                        be cruise missiles and submarines. In Soviet terminology their range would
                        be described as medium range, i.e., less than strategic. Would these then be
                        considered “wild” weapons? Should that be a comfort to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>? <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> indicated that he was looking ahead in regard to
                        these matters.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> added that it would be good if
                        the US were to make a statement about excluding these types of systems. He
                        was a little concerned about this. In Europe, the two sides are looking for
                        agreement. But the US wants to be able to have systems which cover the
                        eastern <pb n="598" facs="0629" xml:id="pg_598"/>part of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, the central part of that country,
                        Central Asia, etc. He thought he had made his point clearly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                  </hi> indicated
                        that he understood. The two sides would have to deal with that question. As
                        technology changed, previous definitions would have to be given careful
                        thought. These are questions which involve bookkeeping. When should weapons
                        be considered theater weapons? By US standards, certain types of weapons
                        have traditionally been considered strategic, i.e., submarine-based weapons.
                        Other questions involving ranges of weapons, i.e., those on mobile
                        platforms, should be included.</p>
                    <p>For the above reasons, as <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had
                        said, the relation between INF and <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>
                        is very important. Some questions of definition which pose problems with
                        regard to theater weapons may be dealt with more readily if examined from
                        the point of view of different categories. President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> had also indicated in West Berlin
                        that the US looks forward to a greater exchange of information with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in the future, aimed at
                        confidence building measures, such as notification of military exercises and
                        missile launchings, whether or not the missiles leave the territory of the
                        launching state. The US would soon present its concrete proposals about such
                        exchanges of data for confidence building measures and arms control in
                        general. At the moment, the US has still not decided on the best venue for
                        dealing with these matters, but it urges the Soviet side to be
                        receptive.</p>

                        indicated that the Soviet side thought we would be remiss if we simply
                        forgot about the treaty concluded by the former US Administration. A great
                        deal of work was put into that treaty. It had been signed by <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> in Vienna. The treaty was balanced. It was in the
                        interests of both sides, and these interests had been very carefully
                        weighed. The present US Administration has indicated that the usefulness of
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II has been exhausted. It has
                        been buried. But the US has not said how deeply it has been buried. The
                        Soviet side feels that this matter should not be dealt with so lightly. All
                        the positive results of those negotiations should be preserved.</p>
                    <p>First of all, it would be good if <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II
                        were ratified by both the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.
                        Questions of prestige (i.e. who proposed and signed the treaty) should take
                        second place.</p>
                    <p>Some questions concerning time would exist, of course, since the treaty has
                        not been ratified, and the Protocol has not been put into effect. Certain
                        rules concerning missiles, strategic bombers and cruise missiles would not
                        take effect. For example, the Soviet side had been <pb n="599" facs="0630" xml:id="pg_599"/>bound to remove 200 land-based missile sites. Such an
                        obligation was based on implementation of all the provisions of the treaty
                        and Protocol, and since these provisions had not been confirmed, the Soviet
                        side would not carry out these obligations. Otherwise the treaty is a good
                        one. If the question of strategic arms were to be solved, this would help
                        improve the atmosphere for solving the questions of nuclear arms in Europe
                        as well.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, with regard to the recent proposals announced by Washington in the
                        area of what should be discussed first in regard to strategic arms, the US
                        has the right, of course, to publicly announce its position on this. But
                        such a proposal has no future. It is not acceptable for the Soviet Union.
                        Why? Because it would change the nuclear balance in favor of the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>Attention in the proposals has been concentrated primarily on Soviet heavy
                        SS–18 missiles, which the US side has not taken a liking to for some reason.
                        This is a very one sided and arbritary approach which is intended to
                        undercut Soviet security in the area of nuclear arms.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> could not believe that
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> was not aware of the
                        situation concerning <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, but perhaps
                        he was not, although this did not seem probable. Perhaps <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> knew, but was closing his eyes to it.
                        In this regard <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to make
                        some clarifications. There had been intensive discussions, especially in
                        Vladivostok between President Ford and <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> (<persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> has also been present),
                        in which the US voiced very strong concerns about the Soviet heavy
                            missiles.<note n="4" xml:id="d186fn4">See <ref target="frus1969-76v16#d91">

                        should be included in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. There had
                        been a long argument about this, and finally, agreement was reached that the
                        Soviet Union would be permitted to have its SS–18s and US forward-based
                        systems would not be included in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II.
                        Obviously, no such statement was made, but there was agreement that
                        forward-based systems should be handled in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> III. So how can the US side accuse the Soviet Union of
                        having these missiles and thereby creating an imbalance? It is hard to find
                        the proper words to describe such an approach.</p>
                    <p>The fact that such an agreement was reached should be made known. But it is
                        not known, and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> is convinced
                        that US Congressmen are not aware of it because the Administration is not
                        telling them. They are saying that there is not equality between the sides,
                        and that <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II is a bad treaty, and that
                        the heavy missiles are the main <pb n="600" facs="0631" xml:id="pg_600"/>destabilizing factor. But these missiles are a result of the agreement.
                        They are not destabilizing, and they are not the main factor of concern.</p>
                    <p>If the Soviet Union wished to look at destabilizing factors in order to throw
                        a shadow on the treaty, it could say that the main destabilizing factor is
                        the existence of twice as many warheads on US submarines as on Soviet
                        submarines. The Soviet side would say that we should begin with this
                        subject. But the Soviet side is not saying this. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> should try to see the situation
                        through Soviet eyes. The Soviet Union is ready for the negotiations on
                        strategic weapons, and it will present its position when the time comes. But
                        it asks the US to take a closer look at its proposals, and to take a more
                        serious position.</p>

                        buried. This is so for several reasons. First of all, any attempt to revive
                        the treaty would reopen the controversy which raged in 1979 in the Senate
                        and in the House. Since the President campaigned against <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, it would be politically impossible
                        for the President to support the treaty, which he does not believe (and
                        which <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> also does not believe)
                        constitutes a constructive and fair approach. Having said this, however,
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> would not deny that there
                        were positive things which had been negotiated in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II.</p>

                        most active arms control representative in the US government. Perhaps the
                        Soviet side did not share his views. But he had worked on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I, <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, the Vladivostok accords and the Test Ban Treaty.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would recall that

                    <p>The US side does not reject everything that was accomplished in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. As President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> recently stated publicly, the US

                        treaty ratification.</p>
                    <p>

                    <p>All of the balanced approaches of the two sides can be included in the new

                        modernization, as well as, undoubtedly, Soviet plans for force
                        modernization. The Soviets side had spoken of the US advan<pb n="601" facs="0632" xml:id="pg_601"/>tage in MIRVed SLBMs. These matters must be

                        systems. But the most important destabilizing systems are the heavy
                        land-based missiles. The US is ready to compensate for a reduction in these
                        systems. Hopefully, the Soviet side is not against sharp reductions on both
                        sides. This is the essence of the President’s program, where the focus is on
                        destabilizing systems.</p>
                    <p>

                        positive aspects of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II can be used,
                        although the treaty itself is dead, if not buried.</p>
                    <p>The President is ready for give-and-take in Geneva, but he would never agree
                        to a treaty which would not provide for substantive reductions, or which
                        would permit avenues for increasing destabilizing systems while restraining
                        others which are less destabilizing. Substantial reductions below current
                        levels are very important, not only with regard to systems presently
                        deployed, but future systems as well. A very important question is the
                        question of instantaneous hard-target kill, which the Soviet have with their
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM_1">ICBMs</gloss> and the US has (and will have
                        much more of) on SLBMs. Another important question was the breakout
                        potential of heavy missiles. Value judgments will be made by experts on both
                        sides. But neither side should fear that the other side will not take its
                        interests into account.</p>

                        indicated that the main difference between the Soviet approach and the US
                        approach to the discussion of strategic arms was not that the US wanted
                        substantial reductions and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> did
                        not. The ideal of substantial reductions is not foreign to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. The Soviet side considers that such
                        reductions must take place. The differences arise over the way in which we
                        see the path of negotiations aimed at such reductions. If the two sides are
                        to discuss only one type of weapon and leave everything else aside, then
                        there is a very large gap between the two positions. Such a position is not
                        realistic. Moreover, the Soviet side had serious doubts when it saw the US
                        position. It wondered whether the US side really wants an agreement.</p>

                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>

                        reassure <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that the US is very
                        serious about reaching agreement, and very serious about substantial
                        reductions. The US does not believe that the American people or the people
                        of the world would be satisfied with less. But the sides should not prejudge
                        the outcome of the talks until experts look at the US side’s Phase I
                        proposals, and listen to the Soviet side’s counter proposals. Apparently,
                        public presentation of the US proposals has raised doubts about the way
                        these questions would be resolved at the table. It is very important to take
                        an approach which would not leave the possibility of destabilizing kinds of
                        weapons—first strike, instantaneous hard-target kill systems on both sides.
                        It is difficult to understand why a proposal of <pb n="602" facs="0633" xml:id="pg_602"/>reduction by both sides in this category is called
                        one-sided. But perhaps when the experts get together, the two sides could
                        deal with the matter. However, the Soviet side should not prejudge the
                        outcome solely on the basis of the President’s remarks, without the
                        additional considerations just indicated.</p>

                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> said
                        that the US side is the master of its position. He had raised the subject
                        because the US had openly spoken about it. The US should take a different
                        approach. This is the official Soviet position.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said it would be good to
                        discuss one independent but related matter. He had presented <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s statement at the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> concerning the unilateral promise about
                        no first-strike use of nuclear weapons. It would not be immodest to say that
                        this is an historic decision. If other countries did the same, there would
                        be no nuclear war, no first-strike, no second-strike, and so on. The Soviet
                        side was surprised at the initial reaction of Washington to this. It
                        considers that the US should take a more serious approach. It makes no sense
                        to say that if one takes an obligation of no first strike use of nuclear
                        weapons, this opens the door for use of conventional weapons. This is a
                        contrived stance. It is hard to explain. Perhaps it is political inertia,
                        namely, that since the Soviets have made an important decision, it is better
                        for Washington to oppose it. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> asks
                        that the US take a more objective approach.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> indicated that the US is aware
                        that the Soviet side made a proposal to have an agreement on no use of force
                        (and this was approved by the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>). But
                        no such agreement exists, since the US reacted negatively. So we have an
                        impenetrable wall. Should we simply knock our heads against it? The US also
                        has no desire to fall into the abyss. Even if there are people in Washington
                        who say that they are not bothered by this, no one really believes them.</p>
                    <p>The US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, as well as the other
                        countries of the world, are in one big trench. Both sides should look at the
                        most serious problems before them. And the most serious problem is that of
                        nuclear war. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is not seeking
                        tricks or subterfuge in order to hurt US interests. The only desire of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is to ensure peace in the world.
                        The actions of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will not harm one
                        hair on the head of any nation in the world.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union is disappointed at the reaction of the US to its no first
                        strike proposal, and hopes that this is just an initial reaction, and that
                        US leaders, including the President and <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>, would think this matter over. If all the world’s
                        nuclear powers would do this, questions of strategic arms, European arms and
                        regional questions would appear in a new light.</p>

                        that he was aware of <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                        experience in witnessing history, so <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> was not surprised at such a proposal, since the <pb n="603" facs="0634" xml:id="pg_603"/>Soviet Union had made such a
                        proposal before, along with other proposals, such as nuclear free zones. But
                        in the first place, Western military doctrine had long been structured on
                        the principle of force compensation. Western strategy is defensive, not
                        offensive. Nothing in Western actions since the Second World War suggests
                        the use of force, except with regard to Article 51 of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter. Unfortunately, this has not been
                        the case with the Soviet Union. But the US is looking toward the future and
                        not the past. The West has a defensive strategy. It is against first use of
                        any kind of force. But the topic of use of force is very broad, and involves
                        not only nuclear weapons, which are, indeed, very devastating. There have
                        been more than one hundred conventional military conflicts since the last
                        war and hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in them. These
                        consequences are equally heinous. In addition to conventional warfare, there
                        has been terrorism, insurgency, and violence involving extra-legal means.
                        The West has recoiled from this. This has been the pattern of Soviet actions
                        after World War II, and these actions have caused a large percentage of the
                        conflicts <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had spoken of.
                        Analyses would confirm this. So it is difficult to isolate one particular
                        area (although an especially heinous one) unless some comparable principle
                        is applied globally by the superpowers to outlaw any kind of conflict.
                        Specifically, revolutionary movements have been sustained, led and
                        instigated from outside on the territories of peaceful nations. There has
                        been illegal use of force in subtle ways. Everything should be viewed in
                        totality. There is a fine line between political struggle and application of
                        force. The two sides should get together to discuss the consequences of
                        conflict in general before such one sided proposals as the no first-use of
                        nuclear weapons can make sense. If a person dies from an axe, a stone, a
                        spear or nuclear weapon, it is still unacceptable. This should be discussed
                        in detail, case-by-case.</p>
                    <p>It is difficult for the US to seriously accept the pledge not to use nuclear
                        weapons first in light of the agreements of principle of 1972. The sides had
                        taken a pledge not to take advantage of each other. There have been
                        wholesale violations of that pledge, and this is the basis for American
                        suspiciousness.</p>
                    <p>The West has never used force directly. It has not done so in Western Europe,
                        where the philosophy of structured response has been developed. If the
                        Soviet Union is so magnanimous in its no first strike proposal, it should
                        add credence to it by dismantling some of its systems or at least stopping
                        their build-up.</p>
                    <p>Substantial reductions of nuclear weapons is fair for both sides. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> is truly dedicated to
                        this. His letters to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> have
                        not been cynical. The US is very serious about significant reductions, as
                        the coming weeks and months will confirm. Hopefully, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        <pb n="604" facs="0635" xml:id="pg_604"/>is as interested as it says. If it
                        is, the talks will succeed. But such one sided proclamations or even two
                        sided ones are meaningless when every day, in various regions of the world,
                        the Soviet Union either directly or indirectly violates the spirit, if not
                        the letter, of such a proposal.</p>

                        that he categorically disagreed with such views. They were not convincing.
                        They went against the real desires of those who cherished life and who are
                        opposed to nuclear conflict.</p>
                    <p>He thought that <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had talked
                        strangely, and wondered if everyone in Washington talks the same way and
                        compares the use of stones and swords to nuclear weapons. If we take one
                        individual, then it does not matter whether he dies from a stone or a
                        nuclear weapon. Death is death. But surely it makes a difference whether one
                        person or a thousand people or one million people or three hundred million
                        or five hundred million people die. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s answer seems to have been a stereotyped response. How
                        can there be no distinction between the death of one person and the death of
                        one thousand, one million, three hundred million and five hundred million,
                        people? The Soviet side cannot agree with such an approach, if it reflects
                        the position of the US Administration. Armed conflicts are not all of an
                        equal nature. But, returning to the talks on nuclear arms in Europe and
                        strategic arms, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wished to

                        on the no first-strike proposal. In order that the Soviet record and the US

                        in the world can be insensitive to the problem of nuclear weapons. But there
                        must also be sensitivity to the order of international conduct which could
                        lead to the use of nuclear weapons. The history of the world has seen many
                        efforts directed at applying the rule of law to relations between states and
                        the avoidance of conflict. But when the Soviet Union constantly sends arms
                        to assist insurgents, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> would not
                        accept a lecture on the lack of American understanding of humane principles.

                  </hi> suggested to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> that they continue where they had
                        left off the previous day.<note n="2" xml:id="d187fn2">See <ref target="#d186">Document 186</ref>.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would briefly answer
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s questions, concentrating
                        on the topic of US-Soviet relations, strategic arms, medium-range missiles
                        in Europe and on the Soviet position of non-first-use of nuclear arms.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that the last topic
                        logically related to <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s last
                        statement. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wished to stress
                        first of all that the Soviet Union has not violated any obligations assumed
                        under bilateral arrangements with the US or other international obligations.
                        There were no violations of any kind. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> added that the document mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> previously dealing with US-Soviet
                        relations, and the obligation undertaken not to take any step to harm the
                        other side or take advantage of it, was still valid. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> emphasized that his side did not,
                        does not <pb n="606" facs="0637" xml:id="pg_606"/>and will not do any harm
                        to the US side and he categorically rejected any reproaches made by the US
                        side.</p>
                    <p>However, the Soviet Union had solid grounds to reproach the US because even
                        now as <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> are conducting their talks, the US
                        side has undertaken political steps designed to harm the Soviet Union.<note n="3" xml:id="d187fn3">On June 18, the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> administration extended sanctions on the sale of
                            equipment for use on the Siberian pipeline to also apply to licenses
                            obtained by Western European firms from U.S. corporations. (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                     </hi>, 1982, vol. I, p. 798)</note> At first
                        glance this issue as announced in Washington may seem to be of an economic
                        nature only. But only at first glance. As <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> should know, international economic affairs are so
                        closely interwoven with politics that they cannot be separated. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not think it necessary to be
                        specific as to the steps taken by the US side. It sufficed to say that
                        statements in Washington referred to the Soviet Union and to certain
                        economic problems. There are, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        continued, certain diplomatic niceties that are usually observed. What
                        happened in Washington was a gross, tactless act, not acceptable in
                        international relations where tact is needed. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> saw in this a violation of elementary diplomatic
                        norms. Within hours of the meeting between <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                        this announcement was made in Washington while the two Ministers were
                        discussing issues of war and peace. He accused <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> of ignoring all norms of international behavior, adding
                        that these were trampled underfoot just to harm the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>To continue the same line of thought, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to make it clear that the Soviet Union has
                        never undertaken any action in the international arena to implant
                        revolutions in other countries. Revolutions in other countries, when a new
                        social regime follows an old one, happen due to internal developments in
                        those countries and cannot be imported from without. To insist that this is
                        so amounts to hysterical illiteracy. The Russian revolution of 1917 was not
                        implanted, was not brought to Russia from without, it was not imported. The
                        Russian people did it all themselves. If one tries to implant a revolution
                        then it is an episode of very short duration. Serious changes, so-called
                        social revolutions, are due to internal causes of a given country. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had to categorically refute the
                        notion that the reason for social changes in Cuba, in Vietnam, in
                        Afghanistan, in Kampuchea and other countries was due to Soviet policy. In
                        some countries where the changes took place, there were no Soviet diplomats,
                        no representatives and no diplomatic representation. It would be superficial
                        to think that the export of revolutions was a part of the arsenal of the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>As for situations in other regions of the world, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                        have previously agreed to discuss them and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would not evade it now. During their previous talks,
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> referred to <pb n="607" facs="0638" xml:id="pg_607"/>these topics as geographical questions, so he proposed
                        to address now the situations in various parts of the world and proposed to
                        move in an organized fashion from topic to topic. He added that each side
                        had the right to raise any question it wanted to discuss.</p>
                    <p>As for nuclear arms, he felt that everything had been said before and
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had nothing to add to
                        that score now. However, he wished to note with all clarity that no one
                        should miscalculate the grave consequences of a nuclear war. What
                        consequences there would be for the US and the Soviet Union was well known.
                        Therefore, no one, especially those who hold the tiller and steer the policy
                        of a country, should make such a miscalculation. No one has the right to
                        make such a fatal mistake. The Soviet Union knows that only a madman who has
                        lost touch with reality cannot comprehend the consequences of a nuclear war.
                        He asked <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> to bear in mind that
                        in the Soviet Union the people regard this problem with utmost seriousness
                        and gravity and are aware of the dangers of a nuclear conflict. There was no
                        greater problem facing mankind today than the avoidance of a nuclear war.
                        For this was a matter of life and death. In international politics there is
                        now a duel going on, that is to say those who value the concept of life and
                        those who are against it. This encounter may end in a catastrophe.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> felt that he had answered all
                        the questions pertaining to a nuclear conflict and would hope that <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> would regard them with a great deal
                        of attention. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to add
                        that his side always weighs <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s
                        words and all statements of the US President. He asked <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> again to do the same and to weigh
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s words and to try to
                        understand his thoughts, the development of his thoughts and his analysis of
                        the situation.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                  </hi> expressed
                        his gratitude to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> for the
                        response and the exchange of views. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> felt that the question of a nuclear conflict was very
                        clear to the US side, and the President of the US fully recognizes the
                        problem and also the growing danger of a miscalculation. However, as the
                        nuclear inventory increases, the other side feels free and compelled to do
                        the same to match the first side. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> felt no need to point a finger at the side that was the
                        first to start the nuclear arms race. He knew that the Soviet Union might
                        hold a different point of view on the situation. He wished to emphasize
                        again that the President was fully committed to the goal of a verifiable
                        decrease in nuclear arms. The details of this will be further discussed in
                        Geneva during the <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> talks.</p>
                    <p>About revolutions, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> continued,
                        there were different ways to subscribe to these concepts because there were
                        just revolutions aimed at improving social conditions and introducing a new,
                        just system. There were also revolutions which were transplanted from other
                            coun<pb n="608" facs="0639" xml:id="pg_608"/>tries. He did not want to
                        challenge the Russian theory on revolutions, but history has been
                        transformed by revolutions which contained seeds of social justice. However,
                        looking back, he cannot fail to notice that now the Soviet Union is using
                        force to preserve the status quo. As an example, Afghanistan wanted to
                        introduce political reforms and changes. Force was used to stop them. Such
                        changes take place in other parts of the world too. In Poland, for instance,
                        there was a complete change of the situation where an attempt for reform led
                        to the use of force by the present regime. Therefore, there is a new phase
                        in history, and there is a certain reversal in the way countries react to
                        revolutions. The powerful forces which desire a change may be greater
                        threats to peace than just nuclear arms, because the latter are only tools
                        in the hands of man. The two countries, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> continued, cannot ignore the tensions existing between
                        East and West. Therefore, if the two powers are serious in preventing a
                        danger of a nuclear encounter, they must deal with other aspects of the
                        East-West confrontation.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> then addressed <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement about a certain
                        announcement made in Washington the previous day. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> assured <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that this move was not preconceived to coincide with
                        the present meeting. It was an unrelated event, and <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had to reiterate that the US does not
                        believe in waging economic war against the Soviet Union. The decision which
                        was previously taken related to events in Poland alone. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> would return to this topic
                        shortly.</p>
                    <p>In previous exchanges between the two countries, the Soviet Union has stated
                        it has the right to support wars of liberation. The US side could do this
                        too, but such actions could lead to increased tensions in the future and
                        have a pervasive effect on the relations between the two powers. He felt
                        that cooperation was necessary and that the two powers should use their
                        influence to improve the atmosphere. Having made this general historical
                        review, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> wanted to conclude that
                        it was not for the US to exploit certain situations to aggravate them and to
                        jeopardize interests of the Soviet Union. But the US side reserved the right
                        to take measures if the Soviet Union does not join in an improvement of
                        East-West relations. Such a move would benefit both sides. The US was ready
                        to cooperate fully and was equally prepared to join in any meaningful
                        cooperative venture to improve the situation. It was clear to <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> that there were hot spots in the
                        world, and he called upon <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> for
                        cooperation in these areas on a basis of reciprocity and equality. If an
                        overall understanding cannot be reached, it is likely that difficulties may
                        arise in many different areas of US-Soviet relations. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> would ask <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> to inform his leadership that in the US all doors
                        are open, all opportunities are there and President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> is fully prepared to work across
                        the whole spectrum to improve East-West relations.</p>

                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> replied
                        that he, too, shared <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s concerns
                        but wished to continue with a review of the world situation and concentrate
                        on some countries mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>.
                        But mainly he wanted to evaluate the situation in regions where tension does
                        exist. He then wanted to evaluate US policy in certain parts of the world
                        and finally what can be done to solve certain problems and relax tensions in
                        these areas.</p>
                    <p>In previous discussions, he and <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                        mentioned Cuba. In <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s view,
                        Cuba is an independent, sovereign country and the social system in that
                        country is up to the Cuban people. The US is trying to pressure Cuba because
                        Cuba has chosen the road to socialism. The US holds a part of that country,
                        namely the Guantanamo Base, which is a military base, and can only be
                        regarded as such. Leave Cuba in peace, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> pleaded, for Cuba was not a threat to the United
                        States, absolutely not. Is Cuba a threat to any Latin American country or
                        Latin American people or to the US?, he asked. If you ask this question of
                        any Latin American, he will only smile. Leave Cuba alone because otherwise
                        the situation there will never become normal; the US blockade was not
                        justified. Cuba should conduct its own domestic and social affairs the way
                        it wishes. Please establish normal relations with Cuba. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> asked that the US refrain from
                        sending emissaries to Cuba, some in civilian clothes who talk softly, then
                        again those with military shoulder boards who irritate the Cubans. By
                        normalizing relations with Cuba, the US will gain a two-fold advantage:
                        relations with that country would be normal and an irritating element in
                        US-Soviet relations would also disappear.</p>
                    <p>In Nicaragua, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> continued, the
                        situation is similar to that in Cuba, that is, the situation is not normal.
                        You pressure Nicaragua; you know it better than we do. You tell Nicaragua
                        which is a small and weak country, what government to have, what social
                        order to install and how to live, and we have to condemn your attitude.
                        Furthermore, neither Cuba or Nicaragua, together or separately, can do
                        anything to other countries and certainly cannot harm the US. You said that
                        Cuba and Nicaragua are doing something to turn other South American
                        countries against the United States. This is a distorted view because they
                        do not do it. If you have such information, it is unrelated to the true
                        state of affairs and would be another case of suspicion and disinformation
                        that is rampant and excessive in your capital.</p>
                    <p>Previously you also mentioned El Salvador and I cannot ignore this issue. It
                        will take a long time to remove that blot from the page of your history
                        because this is a blood bath. People are getting killed. There is no
                        justice. You know better than we how many people have perished, but even
                        what we know makes us shudder. You replace one puppet with another puppet.
                        You use methods which cannot be justified, and you will be held responsible
                        for it. Let the El Salvador <pb n="610" facs="0641" xml:id="pg_610"/>people
                        determine their own social and economic relations. Let them improve
                        relations with other countries without any interference from Washington. The
                        people in El Salvador are not against you. They want peace with their
                        neighbors, with the US which is a big country, and they want to be left
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> continued that although much
                        time had been devoted to the Angolan question both in Geneva and in New
                        York, much remains to be done to improve the situation and to find ways to
                        normalize the situation in Angola, Namibia and South Africa which carried
                        out aggression against Angola and Namibia. In that context, there could also
                        be a discussion of the question of Cuban troops in Angola. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> felt that he and <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> were at one time not far apart on
                        some issues regarding the above and expected the US to act in a certain way.
                        However, he felt that now Washington has bypassed certain arrangements and
                        he was puzzled by it. There was a joint Angolan and Cuban statement in which
                        it was stated that Cuban troops will leave Angola when South African
                        aggression has stopped, when Namibia has gained independence and the
                        security of Angola had been assured. If this was solved, there would be no
                        obstacle to the departure of Cuban troops. Nor would there be if the Angolan
                        government asks the Cuban troops to leave. Therefore, as <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> saw it, it was an either/or
                        situation. The Soviet Union expected Washington to welcome this declaration
                        and to use its influence in South Africa to bring this about. But instead,
                        Washington did nothing about it. Perhaps Washington took this issue too
                        lightly. So, to repeat, Cuban troops will leave Angola when there is no
                        aggression from South Africa, when there is an independent Namibia, and he
                        felt that these issues could be solved and would be good for US-Soviet
                        relations. But instead the US remained indifferent—yes, yes, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> knew that the US maintained certain
                        contacts there, but there was no direction to that policy and no progress is
                        visible. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would like to
                        clarify this policy with <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>; was
                        there a change in US policy, or is it simply inertia on the part of the
                        US?</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wished to leave the Middle
                        East aside for a moment and move on to the Afghanistan problem. He reminded
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> of the discussion about
                        meetings between Soviet and US experts on the Afghanistan question. Points
                        of contact were established but then US interest seemed to have cooled. To
                        sum up the Soviet position: the Soviet Union would like to see an
                        independent, nonaligned, repeat nonaligned, Afghanistan. Withdrawal of
                        Soviet troops from Afghanistan would be at the request of the Afghanistan
                        government which originally invited Soviet troops to come in, and if outside
                        intervention ceased, by which <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        meant no gangs infiltrating from Pakistan and, to some degree, from Iran. If
                        such intervention would stop, then Soviet troops could be pulled out of
                        Afghanistan. If not, it is clear that <pb n="611" facs="0642" xml:id="pg_611"/>Soviet troops will stay there and do their duty. Then
                        let the foreign gangs invade that country for they will be ground up and
                        massacred by the defending forces. This would not be in the US interest.
                        Furthermore, a settlement in Afghanistan would remove tensions in that part
                        of Asia. This would be one less irritant in US-Soviet relations. Such were
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s views on
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>Next <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wished to move on to
                        Kampuchea. First of all, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        wished to stress an anomaly at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, where
                        this country was represented by the Pol Pot henchmen. He did not know
                        whether this suited US policy or whether it was simply a case of inertia.
                        The time will come, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was sure,
                        when real representatives of the Kampuchean people will sit in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to stress that Pol Pot was a politically dead
                        entity and it was an ugly act to impose this puppet regime from without. It
                        would be good if the US would adopt a more realistic policy in Kampuchea,
                        and the sooner the better. By doing so, this would also lessen tensions in
                        that part of the world.</p>
                    <p>The situation in Vietnam and in Laos was viewed in a positive spirit by the
                        Soviet Union. If the US would establish relations, based on international
                        norms and on the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter, the Soviet
                        Union would only be glad to see such a development.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would also hope that the US
                        will stop driving wedges between certain nations and the Soviet Union. The
                        Soviet Union was against such a policy and it never applied such measures
                        itself. As an example, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> could
                        name several countries in Latin America. Everytime the Soviet Union speaks
                        to these nations it makes it very clear that it does not want to harm the
                        relations between Latin American countries and the US. The Soviet Union has
                        no wedges to drive between countries. In fact, it has no specialists to make
                        wedges and would have to ask for US assistance to make wedges and then the
                        US would impose sanctions on wedges.</p>
                    <p>As for Poland, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> continued, he
                        was not about to discuss it with the US or any other country. The Polish
                        question was an internal Polish question and again no representative of the
                        Soviet government will discuss this problem with any other country of the
                        world. The Poles and only the Poles are competent to resolve their own
                        affairs. Washington is making a mistake by undertaking gross steps against
                        Poland or the Soviet Union and artifically linking these two countries
                        together. It may give the US some momentary political capital, but no
                        long-range advantage.</p>
                    <p>In your Administration today, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        continued, those who believe in short-range advantages have gained the upper
                        hand and try to pressure Poland. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was sure that Washington had levers numbered one,
                        two, three, four and perhaps many more that they could pull at will to
                        pressure Poland and at the same time not miss <pb n="612" facs="0643" xml:id="pg_612"/>the occasion to step on the Soviet Union’s toes.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> believed that it would be
                        more realistic to take the long-range view and not think that what the
                        Polish government does is due to pressure from the Soviet Union. This is a
                        fatal and erroneous concept and the Soviet Union rejects this categorically.
                        What can be more authoritative than the declarations made by the Soviet
                        leadership and by the Polish leadership concerning the situation in Poland?
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would like to hope that
                        the US Administration will adopt a more realistic policy towards Poland and
                        stop pressure, sanctions, and similar actions often not of a very clean
                        nature. It would be best to maintain normal relations and to draw proper
                        conclusions and not blame the Soviet government for it.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> concluded that he had now
                        covered all areas and questions raised by <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> and would hope that the US Administration will devote
                        some attention to it. But before closing he wanted to say a few words about
                        China. The Soviet Union knew the nature of US relations with China and there
                        were no well-kept secrets there. He would like to repeat what he had already
                        told Presidents Nixon, Ford and <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> that, it would be best in US-China relations not to
                        look at momentary advantages but to look at the long-range prospect and not
                        to forget interests and perspectives of US-Soviet relations and not to
                        ignore the general situation of the world because this was the key to
                        permanent peace. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to
                        stress that aid to China which included armaments could be against the
                        interests of the Soviet Union and its security. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wished to assure <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> that his government kept these developments clearly in
                        their field of vision. That completed <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s main coverage.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                  </hi> replied
                        that he felt less than satisfied with the progress made since their last
                        meeting and attributed it to a number of factors.</p>
                    <p>As for the Cuban situation, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> said
                        that the US had no interest in interfering in the internal affairs of Cuba.
                        However, the US was concerned by the export of arms, revolution and
                        terrorism from Cuba to other countries. This was an unsatisfactory state of
                        affairs. The US has talked with Cuban leaders such as Mr. Rodriguez, and
                        General <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName> talked to Mr. Castro
                        about normalization of relations and US willingness to do so. But deeds and
                        acts show otherwise. However, progress could be reported in such areas as
                        the elections in El Salvador, although there was an increase in arms
                        shipments from Cuba to terrorist bands in El Salvador. But the people of El
                        Salvador showed clearly their choice. While the Soviet Union was concerned
                        about US arms to China, the US was concerned about arms from Cuba to
                        Nicaragua and <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> wanted this to be
                        clearly understood. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> repeated
                        that the US would welcome a normalization of relations with Cuba, but Cuban
                        intervention in friendly countries and in Nicaragua spoke against it. It was
                        clear what the Nicaraguan people wanted and they were against <pb n="613" facs="0644" xml:id="pg_613"/>the Sandinista policy. The US offered an
                        eight-point proposal<note n="4" xml:id="d187fn4">See Bernard Gwertzman,
                            “Nicaragua is Given New U.S. Proposal to Mend Relations,” <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, April 10, 1982, p. 1.</note> and
                        will explore the possibilities in the weeks ahead. However, the US will not
                        accept interference in El Salvador, will not tolerate terrorism and will not
                        tolerate interference in Honduras. There is no doubt that South American
                        countries are appalled by the situation in Nicaragua. It is up to the
                        Nicaraguan people to make the choice and, as for El Salvador, what <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> called a blot is a manifestation of
                        the strength of the free spirit of the Salvadoran people, as could be seen
                        in the number of votes cast in the elections. The people of El Salvador want
                        to be free of external interference and internal subversion. The social
                        reform program as a result of the elections in El Salvador is a success.</p>
                    <p>On the subject of Angola and Namibia, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> wanted to assure <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that the US was active and was able to make South
                        Africa respond to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Resolution 435,
                        which was an unprecedented success. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> also referred to his communication with Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> regarding this problem.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> felt that the presence of
                        Cuban soldiers in Angola during the last six years was unacceptable and the
                        time for them to leave has come. The Angolan government and the Angolan
                        people suffer from internal conflicts and foreign insurgents in the southern
                        part of the country. The South African government is concerned about raids
                        across the border into Namibia. There was a three-phase proposal concerning
                            <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>, South Africa and the
                        Front-Line States but the Soviet Union advised <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> to reject it, although the plan was reluctantly accepted
                        by South Africa.</p>
                    <p>South Africa proposed a plan for Namibian independence by next year. This was
                        endorsed by the Front-Line States and <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> and now a trigger was needed to set it in motion, namely
                        the withdrawal of Cuban soldiers from Angola. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> felt that the Soviet Union could help with this problem
                        by confirming that Cuban soldiers will indeed leave. This in turn would
                        influence South African withdrawal from Namibia. There would be no public
                        linkage of these events, but they would have to occur simultaneously. The US
                        would support such a development. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> felt that this opportunity should not be missed,
                        otherwise the Front-Line States and other African countries would lay blame
                        where it belongs. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> stressed that
                        the US was seeking no advantage for itself in that part of the world other
                        than the pullout of superpowers, which would leave these countries to decide
                        their own fate. He mentioned that Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCA_1">Crocker</persName> discussed these issues with Soviet
                        Deputy Minister <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> the
                        previous day. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> repeated that US
                        and Soviet interests were very similar, and the two powers could cooperate
                        to obtain desired results, namely independent <pb n="614" facs="0645" xml:id="pg_614"/>Namibia which South Africa was ready to recognize. But
                        if the opportunity is missed, South Africa will take matters into her own
                        hands and a long conflict would ensue which would be a tragedy to the whole
                        region. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> would welcome <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s comments on the above.</p>

                        that as for Cuban troops in Angola, he saw an organic connection between the
                        cessation of South African aggression against Angola, South African pullout
                        from Namibia, a free Namibia as a nonaligned state and the pullout of Cuban
                        troops from Angola. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wondered
                        what would happen if Cuban troops would leave but aggression against Angola
                        (air raids) does not stop, if Namibia does not become a state and if South
                        Africa remains in Namibia. The Soviet Union was not seeking a subterfuge
                        there, but then again there are voices in Washington which claim that Cubans
                        will remain in Angola forever and ever. No credence should be given to such
                        voices.</p>

                        that the critical point in the settlement of the problem was near. He felt
                        that contacts should be kept up and indicated that he would be in touch with
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> within a week or
                        two.</p>
                    <p>Concerning Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> was well
                        aware of the difficulties involved in self-determination of that country and
                        would be willing to have experts of the two sides meet in Moscow in July to
                        discuss the Afghanistan issue. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                        was sure that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was aware of
                        the US basic attitudes. The Special Representative of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary General held informal discussions
                        with the Government of Pakistan. Bilateral discussions should look at the
                        existing gaps which were known to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. The US side was interested in normalizing the
                        situation in Afghanistan, in a truly nonaligned government in Kabul, a
                        program for national reconstruction and reconciliation, provisions for the
                        return of refugees and the total pullout of Soviet forces. All this was not
                        an easy task, but the US was prepared to have its experts examine the
                        differences. However, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> did not
                        wish to imply that he agreed with all of <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s observations, but, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> continued, he was here to communicate and not to
                        discuss history.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> then turned to Kampuchea. He
                        felt that memory was short concerning the invasion of that country and the
                        installation of a certain regime. It was not US inertia but the willingness
                        on the part of the US to let the people of the region determine their fate
                        and solve their problems. Hanoi has isolated itself from the international
                        community by illegally occupying Kampuchea. Pol Pot was not a US choice and
                        the US rejected him as a tyrant. At the same time, the present regime there
                        was also tyrannical. Washington and Moscow would benefit if North Vietnam
                        would pull out its troops, if a referendum could be held about
                        self-determination in that region. In addition, Moscow would not have to
                        bear the substantial costs of that operation. The US is willing to work with
                        Hanoi only if Hanoi pulls out of Kampuchea and allows the people
                        self-determination.</p>
                    <pb n="615" facs="0646" xml:id="pg_615"/>
                    <p>The situation in Laos is ambiguous, there are conflicting forces and
                        influences but a normalization there would be desirable. Nations of that
                        region should take the lead and the US would be willing to cooperate but so
                        far has met with intransigence.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> then turned to the Polish
                        question, which he regarded as difficult and an obstacle to East-West
                        relations. He felt that no expert or student of the situation would exclude
                        a collapse in Poland during the summer or fall. This in turn could lead to
                        total anarchy. He felt that the relaxation of present measures would involve
                        a certain risk, but to improve relations it would be necessary to introduce
                        a reform along the lines proposed by US and West European countries. This
                        would consist of the following: a dialogue with Solidarity, a release of
                        prisoners, but most importantly, release of Lech Walesa who would conduct
                        the dialogue with the regime. It was clear that resentment was deep-seated
                        in Poland and that there may be difficulties. However, the continuation of
                        the status quo will unleash difficulties not only of an economic but also of
                        a political nature. Polish leaders should attempt a normalization of
                        conditions and not preserve the status quo. The US side was not rigid in its
                        view and would respond to any meaningful move. But the release of Walesa,
                        who is a symbol to the Polish people, was essential, as was a role for the
                        Polish church, since it is an element of moderation. Some prisoners would
                        have to be released, and martial law would have to be removed because it
                        represented a state of oppression. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> also wished to make an observation that the US is
                        deeply concerned about the situation in Poland and that there might be more
                        trouble on the horizon. Western powers could bring no relief unless certain
                        steps were first taken by the Polish regime. The weeks and months ahead
                        could be very difficult and the US side could see the dilemma that the
                        Polish regime was facing.</p>
                    <p>As for China, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> assured <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that the US did not believe its
                        relations with that country should affect its relations with the Soviet
                        Union. This policy goes back to the early 70’s. The US was interested in
                        maintaining good relations with one billion Chinese, but <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> assured <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> will never play the China card nor will the US do
                        anything in relations with China that would undermine its relations with the
                        Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> repeated that the
                        China card is not in the US lexicon. Returning to a statement by <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, in which he accused the US of
                        trying to veto the relations between the Soviet Union and Cuba, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> now felt that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> should not veto US relations with
                        China.</p>
                    <p>As for Cuba, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> felt that the
                        statement by Cuban Vice President Rodriguez in the United Nations was an
                        outrage to the US and to world opinion. That the source of Cuban arms was in
                        Moscow was well known. The statement by Rodriguez that the shipments
                        occurred <pb n="616" facs="0647" xml:id="pg_616"/>before the increased
                        tension in the area is a manifestation of Cuban offensive activity in that
                        area.</p>
                    <p>In summing up the discussion of regional issues, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> felt that the review was useful but the level of actual
                        progress had declined. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> would
                        hope to narrow the differences of opinion on South Africa, on Afghanistan
                        and other issues that were still to be solved. He felt that it would be a
                        tragedy for the American and the Soviet people to squander valuable
                        resources in difficult times.</p>

                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                  </hi> said he
                        wanted to move now to several bilateral issues, such as the consulates in
                        New York and Kiev and human rights, which were sensitive to the Soviet Union
                        but presented a political problem in the United States. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> could give details not as an irritant
                        but as examples of a burden and an obstacle to better relations. The
                        President was receiving daily letters and appeals concerning Jewish
                        emigration and on behalf of such individuals as <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shcharanskiy</persName>. Then there are the <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> talks to think about. As for tensions in Afghanistan, in
                        Poland and human rights—the new Administration does not display a rigid
                        mentality but it reflects the attitude of the American people. Many people
                        react to small things; they react positively to positive gestures.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> started to ask <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> about his press conference on
                        Monday, but <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> asked to speak on the Middle East first.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not wish to trade
                        accusations about Cuba but asked again that the U.S. not pressure Cuba and
                        start building normal relations with that country on the basis of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter and international legal norms. “Do
                        not throw stones into our garden—as the Russian proverb goes,” he added. As
                        for China, there was of course no veto on any relations between any
                        countries, but he felt that US-Chinese relations might be developing at the
                        expense of Soviet security, which was a concern to the Soviet Union.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would hope that the
                        present US Administration would understand this Soviet position. He assured
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> that the Soviet Union will
                        follow US-Chinese relations with great interest and adjust its policy
                        accordingly.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> then turned to the situation
                        in the Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> to know that the Soviet
                        Union was highly indignant at the Israeli aggression against Palestinian
                        refugees in Lebanon and in Syria and he regarded it as a highly gross
                        aggression and a gross provocation. The responsibility for it was not only
                        Israel’s; the US was also responsible for it to a high degree. Looking at it
                        realistically, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> continued, no
                        one can fail to note that the US is mainly responsible for that aggression.
                        Although the US may look at it in a different way, this action did not
                        decrease but in fact heightened the tension in the Middle East and will lead
                        to potential complications on a higher level. The region of the Middle East
                        was not distant from the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union was interested in
                        it in general and <pb n="617" facs="0648" xml:id="pg_617"/>also from the
                        point of view of Soviet security. The Soviet Union does not believe that the
                        Israeli gain of additional territory will help Israel’s security. To hold
                        this view indicates a narrow, even a primitive approach, to that whole
                        question. Those who do it do not understand the full picture and the
                        potential danger in it.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union believes that there is more explosive material in the Middle
                        East now than there was before. It would be prudent for the US to influence
                        the Israelis to pull out from Lebanon and not to seize any new territory.
                        After all, Israel did annex the Golan Heights. Neither the Palestinians nor
                        the Lebanese claim any legitimate Israeli territory. He would hope that US
                        will exert pressure on Israel and should know the Soviet point of view.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> felt that since the
                        more dangerous and more complicated situation in the Middle East was due to
                        Israeli aggression, a Middle East conference should be convened with the
                        states and forces participating in it—<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> will not name a list of the participants since that
                        was an old Soviet proposal elucidated by <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Leonid
                            Brezhnev</persName> during the Party Congress. He asked <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> not to be distracted by momentary
                        considerations but to look at the long-range possibilities because there
                        were other unresolved issues of that region regardless of Egypt, and
                        possible solutions to unresolved questions could possibly be found in such a
                        conference. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was sure that the
                        US could be helpful in such an arrangement.</p>
                    <p>As a separate issue, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> to know how the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> regarded US thinking that giving more
                        arms to Israel would be helpful. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> knew that Israel was saturated with arms, and he
                        knew that if all the arms were to be put into a big pile, the diameter of
                        that pile would be larger than Israeli territory. As a separate issue, Arabs
                        in some respect cannot compete with Israel today but who would know about
                        tomorrow? <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> knew that these
                        fateful events of the last few weeks were causing much headache to <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> immediately retorted that, yes, he had been swallowing
                        aspirins lately.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> continued that the sides may
                        disagree on many Middle Eastern issues, but a long-range settlement was
                        essential and would benefit not only the people of that area but also
                        improve US-Soviet relations. He repeated that his side was full of
                        indignation but he was now ready to listen to <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s views.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">

                  </hi> replied
                        that it was wrong to blame the US for the tragedy in the Middle East. He
                        wanted <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> to know that for the
                        last eleven months his government struggled to prevent the tragedy; that the
                        US was working with the Saudis on this question; and that the ceasefire held
                        for eleven months. He referred <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> to his Chicago speech <pb n="618" facs="0649" xml:id="pg_618"/>in May<note n="5" xml:id="d187fn5">For the text of

                        outlining three points. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> felt
                        that the Soviet Union contributed to the problem by shipping arms to the
                            <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> and thus increasing Israeli
                        paranoia. The US tried to deal with the problem until the situation broke
                        down. The US supported Resolutions 508 and 509.<note n="6" xml:id="d187fn6">See <ref target="#d179fn2">footnote 2, Document 179</ref>.</note> The
                        US side took steps to moderate the attitude of the Israeli government. At
                        the same time, there was no help from the Soviet government, which vetoed
                        the proposal for a peace force in the Sinai and at no time did the US
                        condone Israeli action. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                        suggested that one should not rush to conclusions as to what brought about
                        the current state of affairs. The US is for a prompt Israeli pullback and a
                        return of Lebanese territory to the Lebanese government. The government
                        within a government by the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> has now
                        ceased to exist, and the Palestinian movement should be responsible to the
                        Lebanese government.</p>
                    <p>As for the situation in Iran and Iraq, the US remained impartial in that
                        region and supplied no arms, while the Soviet Union does supply arms to both
                        sides and is creating an even greater danger.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi>
                        immediately replied that US information was wrong, that the Soviet Union
                        only supplied a small quantity of spare parts, due to inertia. However,
                        rumors were being circulated by each side claiming that the other side is
                        receiving arms from the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> continued that <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s accusation that the Soviet Union
                        was responsible for Israeli action was unacceptable. He felt that it was US
                        attitude that allowed Israel to act with impunity. He then warned <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> to be aware that Israel may try to
                        colonize the United States. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        then concluded that it was his position and the position of the Soviet
                        leadership that the US should take effective measures to make Israel pull
                        out of Lebanon. The Soviet Union will try to maintain peace in the Middle
                        East, but the Soviet Union does not agree to Israeli capture of Arab
                        territory and it therefore proposes a conference to find a political
                        solution to the problems in that area. Among other things, the Soviet Union
                        felt that the Palestinian desire for statehood was justified.</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> still had two issues to
                        discuss. With respect to <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, could
                        the Soviet Union expect the US to observe the provisions of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, although the agreement was never
                        ratified? If so, the Soviet Union would abide by these provisions, except
                        for those which have become obsolete because of the passage of time and
                        because of the Protocol.</p>

                        in the affirmative and assured that the US will maintain this position.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> intervened by saying that
                        in the past <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s <pb n="619" facs="0650" xml:id="pg_619"/>answers were so careful that they did plant
                        some seeds of doubt in his mind. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> said that his reply is still the same, namely that the
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II arrangements will be important
                        for the Geneva talks and will be addressed in detail in <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>. The President has stated publicly
                        that the US will abide by existing agreements as long as the Soviet Union
                        does the same.<note n="7" xml:id="d187fn7">Reference is to the President’s

                        that first of all the US side was disappointed that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> could not attend the Disarmament
                            Conference.<note n="8" xml:id="d187fn8">On June 6, the United Nations

                        invited him to visit with President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>, as the President had made clear. Secondly, as for
                        the summit, this issue was pushed forward by newspaper articles. In
                        principle, the President is looking forward to meeting Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>, and Soviet official statements
                        about a summit, its purpose and significance were well known. Summits need
                        preparatory work so that the outcome of a summit meeting could be perceived
                        before the event. Otherwise, such meetings could be disappointing.
                        Therefore, in principle the US is in favor of a summit before the end of the
                        year but much will depend on a joint assessment of the situation, the
                        possible benefits, the timeliness and the results leading to an improvement
                        of relations. In the past, there were summits for the sake of having a
                        summit. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> felt that his view was
                        close to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s attitude.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> replied that he would be
                        ready for an American reply as to the time and place of a possible summit.
                        As for the preparatory work, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s views were the same as <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s.</p>

                        referred to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s press

                        face the press this very afternoon. He thought it useful to exchange views

                        that he would limit himself to describing the meetings as useful without

                        would be no end to questions from the press. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> replied that he would not cross this line, and would
                        describe the exchange as dealing with bilateral, global and areas of mutual

                    <p>To put the lid on this meeting, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said, he felt that all issues were discussed on the
                        level of main principles. He then pointed out that he, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> and other Soviet officials when negotiating with
                        the US side never bring ideological views into the field of foreign policy.
                        He never mentioned ideology to <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                        or tried to convert him to Marxism. In this connection, he wanted to point
                        out that any brave talk against other ideologies, even cursing the ideology
                        of the other side, even trying to bury socialism with or without honor, or
                        saying who would or would not attend this funeral, was a waste of time. His
                        side never indulged in it, and he did not believe in mixing ideology with
                        foreign policy. Having said that, he considered the meeting closed and was
                        ready to put his eyeglasses away.</p>
                    <p>Before closing, <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>

                        that both sides adhered to the above principles but <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> wanted to make clear that attacks on
                        personalities should be excluded from political polemics. He stressed that

                        especially in the US press, and the press tended to sin in this respect. US
                        press 99 percent, the Soviet press one percent.</p>

                    <p>Al held two drawn-out meetings with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>: the one on June 18 (Tab A) was to concentrate on
                        arms control, the one on June 19 (Tab B) was to deal with regional problems
                        but because there was so little <pb n="621" facs="0652" xml:id="pg_621"/>new
                        to say on this subject, the second meeting, too, switched to arms control.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>In the first session, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> restated
                        old Soviet claims, insisting that when due allowance was made for their
                        different enemies and allies, the two great powers had nuclear parity. As
                        concerns concrete proposals he could think of nothing fresh to say and
                        reiterated the need to revive the Vladivostok Accords and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. He appeared particularly upset by
                        your bold proposals for arms reductions which have helped defuse the global
                        unilateral disarmament movement on which Moscow counts heavily to soften our
                        determination to build up U.S. defenses. (S)</p>
                    <p>The second day’s discussions indicated little flexibility on Moscow’s part.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> remained unyielding on
                        Afghanistan though he agreed to uncommitting Embassy-level talks on this
                        subject. He had nothing new to say on Central America and the Caribbean, or
                        on the Middle East. Only in discussing Southern Africa did he hint at
                        possible concessions in the sense that the Soviet Union might consider a
                        Namibian settlement if there were ways of guaranteeing a Marxist-Leninist
                        regime in Angola following the departure of Cuban troops. He was bitter over
                        your “economic warfare” policies, including the expansion of the gas and oil
                        sanctions. (S)</p>
                    <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> pressed for a commitment on a
                        summit which is important to certain factions in the Soviet
                        leadership—those, like himself, grouped around <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>—inasmuch as by meeting formally with the Soviet
                        leader you help legitimize his status at home. (S)</p>
                    <p>In all, the meeting indicated no change in Soviet policy and no move toward
                        serious negotiations and compromises. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s evident anxiety and inflexibility reflect the
                        disarray which the opening of the succession struggle and its recent
                        military and psychological defeats have engendered in Moscow. The Kremlin is
                        still on “hold”.(S)</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>This session lasted five hours, and we concentrated (by his choice as guest
                        and thus first speaker in our <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Mission) on
                        principles and on arms control. We will deal with critical regional security
                        issues when we resume tomorrow; he told me he would start with the Middle
                        East, and I told him I would start with Poland. It was a tough session, and
                        I expect tomorrow’s exchange to be similarly rough.</p>
                    <p>
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was clearly on the defensive,
                        following your successful European trip, the unveiling of your program for
                        arms control and your U.N. speech. He complained forcefully and at length
                        that in fashioning our arms control proposals, we have ignored the
                        long-standing Soviet insistence upon “equal security”. His presentation was
                        one long protestation of Soviet innocence while blaming the U.S. for the
                        deterioration of our relationship and international relations generally.</p>
                    <p>His detailed comments on arms control made clear again that when the Soviets
                        talk about equal security they mean we must admit that an overall nuclear
                        and conventional balance currently exists because they deserve special
                        compensation for their geography and for our Allies’ military strength and
                        systems. He pressed hard for the resuscitation of inadequate arms control
                        agreements of the past, especially the Soviet 1974 Vladivostok accord and
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. He reiterated the Soviet
                        nuclear non-first-use pledge he made at the U.N. on Tuesday.<note n="3" xml:id="d188fn3">June 15.</note>
                  </p>
                    <p>In response, I told him in no uncertain terms that strict equality is the
                        only basis for agreements between us; that previous agreements were
                        inadequate because they failed to limit the most destabilizing systems in
                        both sides’ arsenals; and that reductions in these systems are the only good
                        answer. I told him that the nuclear non-first-use pledge is entirely
                        self-serving given the tremendous Soviet conventional advantage, and
                        restated that in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Europe, the West
                        would never be the first to initiate conflict at any level. It is the Soviet
                        Union, <pb n="623" facs="0654" xml:id="pg_623"/>I pointed out, that bears
                        full responsibility for deterioration in relations because it has used and
                        continues to use or help others to use force.</p>
                    <p>Overall, I came away from the session impressed with how worried and
                        disturbed <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was at the degree
                        to which we have seized the high ground and the initiative in East-West
                        relations. What worries the Soviets the most is your comprehensive program
                        for arms control.</p>
                    <p>American newsmen tell us he is planning a major press conference for
                            Monday<note n="4" xml:id="d188fn4">June 21.</note> (the day he was
                        originally scheduled to depart for Moscow), and I expect him to make some of
                        the same points he made yesterday, and in general, to try to regain some of
                        the high ground for the Soviets through accusations that we have gone over
                        to the offensive and are refusing to negotiate seriously and sincerely etc.,
                        in contrast to them. I therefore plan to meet with the press today, partly
                        to draw some of his poison preemptively, mainly to maintain the offensive on
                        arms control and East-West relations overall that you have seized.</p>

                        <item>My Session with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, June
                            19</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Today’s session lasted four and a third hours, and was devoted largely to
                        regional issues as I had planned. And, as I expected, it was as rough as
                        yesterday’s meeting.</p>
                    <p>We went over the whole gamut of U.S. regional concerns, from Poland to
                        Kampuchea, and also discussed the Middle East at his initiative.</p>
                    <p>On Poland, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> listened
                        impassively while I stated our position on the problems and the prospects,
                        and offered no indication of give. But he reacted bitterly to your decision
                        to extend sanctions, as announced in the newspapers. He complained that it
                        coincided with our meeting, claimed it represented economic warfare, and
                        predicted it would spill over into political relations, since they cannot be
                        separated. Agreeing with the last point, I explained that business-as-usual
                        is <pb n="624" facs="0655" xml:id="pg_624"/>impossible and that economic
                        relations cannot improve so long as Soviet behavior in Poland, Afghanistan,
                        etc., remains unchanged.</p>
                    <p>On Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> gave no hint
                        of a change in the Soviet position. As you and I agreed, however, I did
                        suggest that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName>
                        conduct intensified bilateral discussions in Moscow in July, and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> agreed.</p>
                    <p>The exchange on Central America and the Caribbean was standard: I reiterated
                        the dangers we see and the importance of the issue in our relationship, with
                        particular reference to Soviet military shipments, while <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> insisted once again that we must
                        settle with the locals, but that the Soviets will not stand in the way.</p>
                    <p>Southern Africa presented the one slight ray of hope in an otherwise somber
                        meeting. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> continued to hint
                        that the Soviets would be willing to stand aside from a Namibia settlement
                        which included a Cuban withdrawal from Angola. His major concern seemed to
                        be the stability of the Angola Government and the threat from <persName corresp="#p_SJM_1">Savimbi</persName>. I told him that reconciliation
                        among the factions in Angola is something the parties must work out
                        themselves. The Soviets understand that we are working hard for a genuine
                        settlement, and that they will bear the onus for failure if it fails.</p>
                    <p>On the Middle East, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> repeated
                        all the familiar Soviet claims and proposals about the area. They are
                        obviously smarting from the beating their clients have taken. I made clear
                        that we are working hard on the problem, and remain the only major power
                        capable of moving the disputes of the area toward settlement. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> did raise the possibility that the
                        Soviets will call again for an international conference, and this is
                        something we should be watching carefully in the days ahead.</p>
                    <p>Toward the end of the meeting <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        raised the possibility of a summit. I expressed regret that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had not been able to attend the
                            <gloss target="#t_SSOD_1">SSOD</gloss> and meet with you, and explained
                        that much would depend on future developments and the possibility of
                        carefully prepared results. He did not seem entirely satisfied, concluding
                        that we should let them know when we have chosen a date and place. For
                        obvious political reasons, I think, the Soviets are anxious to have a summit
                        as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> also returned to the question
                        of respecting <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II commitments, asking
                        for more precise details about what you meant when you said we would not
                        undercut existing agreements as long as they do not. I was deliberately
                        vague in response, saying we are comfortable with existing policy, and any
                        questions should be discussed by our negotiators in Geneva.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I made a pitch on humanitarian issues with special reference to
                        Jewish emigration, citing your interest and pointing out that <pb n="625" facs="0656" xml:id="pg_625"/>small gestures in this field can have a
                        disproportionately large payoff in overall relations.</p>
                    <p>It was a wearing meeting, but useful, and not only in the sense that it
                        registered the fact of superpower dialogue in tense times. It built on the
                        momentum you have created in our favor in recent days and weeks by
                        presenting a sensible, full-scale program for arms control negotiations and
                        getting Allied support for it by making absolutely clear to the Soviets that

                    <p>In his memoir, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> contended that

                        to oppose the extension of sanctions to overseas manufacturers. <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> did so with his usual

                        material to Soviets. Cabinet very divided. I ruled we would not remove
                        sanctions. There hadn’t been the slightest move on the Soviets part to

                        adoption of new regulations to include equipment produced by subsidiaries of

                        In his opening remarks, Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName>
                        reviewed the original purpose of the sanctions and stated that the President
                        had selected to respond to the repression in Poland with a measured embargo.
                        He made clear that principle is an important part of the <pb n="627" facs="0658" xml:id="pg_627"/>President’s life and that this is reflected
                        in his policies. The embargo was described as being “conditional” with
                        periodic reviews. The complete lifting of the sanctions would be contingent
                        on fulfillment of the three stated preconditions for advancing human
                        freedoms and reconciliation in Poland. Since the inception of the sanctions,
                        the question of how far they would be extended was left open.</p>
                    <p>The President warned the Soviets at the time that he would be compelled to
                        take further action if the repression continued unabated. As a result of the
                        President’s decision on June 18,<note n="3" xml:id="d190fn3">See <ref target="#d189">Document 189</ref>.</note> the sanctions were
                        extended “to the full reach of the law.” During the course of <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Al Haig</persName>’s meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  <note n="4" xml:id="d190fn4">See
                                <ref target="#d186">Documents 186</ref> and <ref target="#d187">187</ref>.</note> in the interim, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> provided indications that a thaw would occur in
                        Poland and that the sanctions were creating difficulties. Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName> stated that our intelligence
                        confirms that the sanctions are raising havoc at a time when the Soviets are
                        scrambling for hard currency earnings. He further stated that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s representations were not borne
                        out—Walesa is still confined even further from his home—with virtually no
                        movement toward reconciliation.</p>
                    <p>The President continued to defer a decision on the controls until after the
                        Versailles Summit.<note n="5" xml:id="d190fn5">A reference to the Versailles
                                <gloss target="#t_G7_1">G–7</gloss>, which took place from June 4 to
                            6.</note> At no time did we suggest that a decision was conditional on
                        progress concerning the credit initiative. We have been in constant
                        communication with the Allies through State, Commerce and other agencies and
                        carefully monitoring the Polish situation. After Versailles—where there were
                        “certain results and non-results”—the President again deliberated on this
                        issue. The Polish situation was judged as not having improved and even
                        worsened—thus the President acted on the same leverage principle—the
                        sanctions were extended to the reach that the law will allow “which is yet
                        to be determined.”</p>
                    <p>Since the decision the Administration has received a “parade” of complaints
                        from the British, West Germans and others. Nevertheless, Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName> made clear that the President will
                        not retreat from this solid principle until there is “some deed or sign from
                        the Soviet Bloc.” Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName> stated
                        that he hoped these measures would be temporary and that we have information
                        that the East Bloc is deeply concerned about their economic situation. He
                        assured the group that the President would be briefed on the results of the
                        meeting.</p>

                        The Senator stated that there was “no one in this room who does not put
                        country ahead of company.” The question raised was: “How do we back our
                        country effectively?” He further questioned if the sanctions were
                        devastating a part of the US business <pb n="628" facs="0659" xml:id="pg_628"/>community with no results or negative impact on the
                        Soviets. He proceeded to encourage the respective business executives to
                        state their concerns.</p>

                    <p>—Until mid-1978 the company had 85% of Soviet pipelayer business. Due to “on
                        again—off again” <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policies, it was down
                        to only a 15% market share.</p>
                    <p>—12,000 man-years of jobs lost to US because of transfer of business to Japan
                        (Komatsu).</p>
                    <p>—Overall, 17,000 workers laid off by the company (35% of employees).</p>
                    <p>—Operating at “break-even” level. Situation described as “major

                    <p>—Can sell upper machine but not lower machine (boom). Given the low
                        technology of the boom, this restriction was termed “ridiculous.”</p>
                    <p>—Equipment reportedly would not delay the pipeline and only result in loss of
                        business.</p>
                    <p>—Due to sanctions policy, the Soviet market is closed to the company. Soviets
                        now refuse to even discuss general machines not restricted by the embargo
                        because of the company’s perceived support for <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policy and the President in this matter.</p>
                    <p>—Company has $1 million in Soviet ordered items having to be scrapped.</p>
                    <p>—Carrying costs on other inventory was $4.5 million due to two-year period to

                    <p>—In an effort to summarize the Administration’s position on the President’s
                        June 18 action and respond to questions and statements made by other
                        participants, the following points were made:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Grain versus December 29 Sanctions</p>
                    <p>• These policies should be differentiated.</p>
                    <p>• Pipeline sanctions are part of a measured and selective response to the
                        Polish situation.</p>
                    <p>• Past Administration’s Afghanistan embargo demonstrated the unilateral
                        sacrifice to our farmers from using a grain sanction due to abundant
                        alternative suppliers of this fungible commodity. (EC sales increased 400%
                        to <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in helping to offset US supply
                        shortfalls.) Select US oil and gas technology and equipment is unique and
                        extremely difficult to replace with substitutes.</p>
                    <p>• Pipeline will generate a huge amount of hard currency ($6–8 billion
                        annually), while grain <hi rend="italic">absorbs</hi> an even greater volume
                        of hard currency ($11–12 billion in the last purchasing year).</p>
                    <p>—No negotiations in progress on a new long-term grain agreement. We have
                        reserved our options on grain.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Framework in which to view President’s decision:</p>
                    <p>Were the President to have lifted the sanctions or maintained unchanged:</p>
                    <p>• Would undermine US credibility, will and consistency in being able to
                        pursue a stated policy toward Polish authorities and the Soviet <pb n="631" facs="0662" xml:id="pg_631"/>Union; i.e., demonstration to <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Allies alike that “stonewalling” the
                        US over a sufficient period of time will result in the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> unilaterally “caving in.” Danger of being
                        viewed as a country with a policy half-life of six months—US would appear
                        indecisive and weak.</p>
                    <p>• Commercial interests cannot be allowed to supersede principles. If the
                        business community and trade relations were permitted to be totally
                        insulated and sheltered from advancing important US foreign policy
                        objectives:</p>
                    <p>—The denial of the foremost non-military policy tool available to the US for
                        moderating Soviet geopolitical behavior, particularly given its limping
                        economy.</p>
                    <p>—If not the repression in Poland, then when do we interrupt “business as
                        usual” with an aggressive Soviet customer? If not the United States, then
                        who will lead the Alliance away from undue dependency on Soviet gas and
                        providing the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> with the necessary hard
                        currency to pursue its geopolitical objectives?</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Conclusion:</hi> The meeting concluded with perceptions
                        concerning the wisdom of the sanctions policy still significantly different.
                        However, all agreed that it had been a highly useful session and a dialogue
                        that should be continued.</p>

                    of the summer of 1982. On June 25, 1982, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> wrote in his diary: “Today was the day—I told Al H. I had
                    decided to accept his resignation. He didn’t seem surprised but he said his
                    differences were on policy and then said we didn’t agree on China or Russia etc.
                    I made a simple announcement to the press and said I was nominating <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George Shultz</persName> for the job. I’d called him
                    &amp; like the patriot he is he said ‛yes.’ This has been a heavy load. Up to
                    Camp David where we were in time to see Al read his letter of resignation on
                    T.V. I’m told it was his 4th re-write. Apparently his 1st was pretty strong—then
                    he thought better of it. I must say it was O.K. He gave only one reason &amp;
                    did say there was a disagreement on foreign policy. Actually the only
                    disagreement was over whether I made policy or the Sec. of State did.”

                    State. After intense and prolonged consideration, I concluded that the nation’s
                    interests would best be served by leaving the service of my country at this
                    time. My decision, you can be sure, will in no way affect the state of relations
                    between our two countries. The United States will persevere in its efforts to
                    achieve a more stable and constructive long-term relationship with the Soviet
                    Union. The policies which the United States has pursued over the past year and a
                    half are those of the President, and they shall endure. As I turn over my
                    responsibilities, you should know that I have valued my own relationship with
                    you. We have had frank, but useful exchanges on the many issues that face our
                    two countries. My successor will, I know, continue to attach great importance to
                    this dialogue. I urge you, Mr. Minister, to work closely with him in the months
                    and years ahead; the welfare of both of our countries, and the world at large,

                </opener>
                <p>The situation in Lebanon and in its capital—Beirut, in particular, is assuming an
                    even more tragic character. The Israeli forces are engaged in blanket
                    destruction of the Lebanese and the Palestinians—women, children and the
                    elderly. Israel perpetrates in Beirut acts of sheer vandalism against the
                    civilian population and destroys the vital functions of the city.</p>
                <pb n="633" facs="0664" xml:id="pg_633"/>
                <p>No matter what political criteria you may apply to the events in Lebanon one
                    perfectly obvious fact is undeniable—a barbaric destruction of people is taking
                    place there by Israel which is in fact an ally of the U.S. Surely, no one will
                    believe that Washington is allegedly unable to persuade Israel to end the
                    bloodshed and to cease fire.</p>
                <p>Through all of its actions, especially in the latest days and hours, the
                    aggressor demonstrates that it cannot wait consummating its criminal acts, with
                    no thought being given whatsoever to what new mountains of hatred it is creating
                    around the Israeli state and the Jewish people. Indeed those mountains can crush
                    on them in the future with all their weight.</p>
                <p>Today, perhaps, even leaders with stone hearts cannot turn a deaf ear to the
                    appeals of those who every day and every hour are dying in Beirut and in Lebanon
                    by the hand of the Israeli invaders.</p>
                <p>I wish to express the hope that at this critical moment in the events in Lebanon
                    and around that country the sense of responsibility and common reason will,
                    after all, prevail over calculations of expedient and momentary nature, and that
                    the U.S. will do all in its power so that there be a cease-fire and the mission
                    of the U.S. emissary in the Middle East stop serving as a screen for continuing
                    the Israeli aggression.</p>
                <p>If various plans come into being right now with regard to participation of some
                    international forces in achieving separation between the forces defending West
                    Beirut, on the one hand, and the Israeli troops, on the other, what is the
                    reason for not using the U.N. military units which are already deployed on the
                    Lebanese soil by a decision of the Security Council?</p>
                <p>We are aware of your statement that you are prepared in principle to send a
                    contingent of American forces to Lebanon.<note n="2" xml:id="d192fn2">Reference

                <p>In response to <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s suggestion that
                    we have lunch before his departure for the Soviet Union on consultations and
                    leave on July 14, I invited him to lunch at the Department July 9. Following are
                    the highlights of our conversation.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S.-SOVIET AFFAIRS</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">General</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked how I saw the future
                    development of relations between our two countries. He could tell me quite
                    frankly that the view of most of the Politburo members was that it was
                    “hopeless” to expect an improvement in the relationship during the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration. He acknowledged that
                    the President himself had toned down somewhat the sharpness of his anti-Soviet
                    rhetoric and this was helpful. However, the President still referred to the
                    idea—which <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> called
                    “ridiculous”—that the Soviet Union could be toppled by economic sanctions.</p>
                <p>Overall, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said the view in Moscow
                    was that the general attitude of the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration toward the Soviet Union was so negative
                    that it was simply not realistic to think in terms of a basic improvement of
                    relations. It is true that we are talking about various subjects, but the talk
                    refers only to details and no progress is made. He felt that what is needed is a
                    break with this approach and a new initiative from the U.S. which could overcome
                    the obstacles between us.</p>
                <p>In response, I said that the U.S. Administration took a realistic view of the
                    U.S.-Soviet relationship. It was true that we were critical of many aspects of
                    Soviet performance and policies. No one hid this, least of all the President,
                    and I thought this attitude was reflective of <pb n="635" facs="0666" xml:id="pg_635"/>the wide majority of the U.S. people. In this regard, I
                    noted our concern, <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>, about the Soviet military
                    buildup; Soviet occupation of Afghanistan; Soviet pressures against Poland;
                    increased Soviet arms deliveries to Cuba; and continued support of Communist
                    interference in Central America. I said that progress on such issues would be
                    welcomed and would contribute to improving the climate between our two
                    countries.</p>
                <p>With regard to Afghanistan, I noted our proposal for beginning expert talks in
                    Moscow July 22–23 and said we hope the Soviets would agree to this. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> thought that this proposal already had
                    been approved and promised to check on it.</p>
                <p>Referring to Poland, I said we continued to hope that steps would be taken in
                    Poland to lift martial law, release the prisoners and reinstitute a dialogue
                    with Solidarity. I wondered if any moves in this direction could be expected on
                    July 22, the Polish National Day. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> made no substantive response.</p>
                <p>I raised the question of Namibian independence and said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had the impression from his talk with
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that the Soviet Union might
                    be interested in working cooperatively to create conditions to make independence
                    possible.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> confirmed that the Soviets would
                    be interested in further discussions in this regard. I indicated that we might
                    propose a continuation of expert talks with the Soviets as a follow-up to the
                    discussions Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCA_1">Crocker</persName>
                    had in New York with <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d193fn2">On June 16, <persName corresp="#p_CCA_1">Chester
                            Crocker</persName> and Georgiy Kornienko met in New York to discuss
                        Namibia.</note>
                    <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said this would be viewed
                    favorably.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summit</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked for our views regarding a
                    U.S.-Soviet Summit. He disclaimed any intention of pressing for such a meeting,
                    but said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had agreed
                    “in principle” to such a meeting in his discussion with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> in New York.<note n="3" xml:id="d193fn3">See <ref target="#d186">Documents 186</ref> and <ref target="#d187">187</ref>.</note>
                    <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that the Soviets consider
                    that the ball is now in our court to come up with suggestions for a time and
                    place for a summit. He recalled that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had spoken of a meeting in October in either Helsinki
                    or Geneva.</p>
                <p>I said that, as the President had suggested, he would have been prepared to meet
                    with <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> in New York at the time of
                    the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Special Session on Disarmament. In
                    general, we felt that any summit meeting should be well prepared and should hold
                    the prospect of positive results.</p>
                <pb n="636" facs="0667" xml:id="pg_636"/>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> agreed and inquired whether we
                    were now engaged in specific preparation for a summit. I said that I felt the
                    talks already underway on INF and <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> could
                    be considered in this light; we would wish to review the status of those talks
                    as well as anything which might develop from our contacts on Afghanistan and
                    Southern Africa in connection with our consideration of a summit meeting. Poland
                    is important, too.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> observed that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> presumably would be meeting in New York at the time of
                    the General Assembly in September. It would be natural to expect that they would
                    take up the question of a summit meeting at that time; while the period
                    following New York and before a possible summit in October would be short, it
                    probably still would be possible to prepare adequately for a summit.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Humanitarian Questions</p>
                <p>I referred to the general area of humanitarian questions, including emigration,
                    reunification of families and treatment of dissidents and said that progress on
                    these would be very helpful in terms of our relationship. These matters, of
                    course, were of concern to the Administration, to Congress and to the general
                    public.</p>
                <p>I drew particular attention to the situation of the Pentacostalists and expressed
                    hope for a favorable resolution of this long-standing problem. I also mentioned
                    the recent cases involving U.S.-Soviet marriages, noting that two Soviets
                    spouses of American citizens were now on a hunger strike to protest their
                    inability to receive visas to come to the United States to join their wives.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> had no substantive comment to
                    make on these questions except to say that family reunification cases are easier
                    to handle than emigration cases (the latter presumably a reference to the
                    Pentacostalists).</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that he understood that our
                    list of reunification cases had decreased and said he attached importance to
                    resolving reunification questions.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Secretary-Designate <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>
               </p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> noted that the
                    Secretary-Designate had visited Moscow several times and was known to some of
                    the Soviet leaders. He thought this was a positive factor. He recalled that,
                    whatever Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s views may have
                    been, the anti-Soviet rhetoric of his speeches had been particularly noted in
                    Moscow and had not been appreciated. He hoped Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> would avoid such statements.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he had heard a rumor that
                    Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> would be making a trip to
                    China in the near future and asked if this was true. <pb n="637" facs="0668" xml:id="pg_637"/>I said I had heard nothing about such a trip and that the
                    Secretary-Designate’s travel plans for the fall had not been worked out.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> wondered if it would be possible
                    for him to call on the Secretary-Designate before his (<persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s) departure the afternoon of July 14.
                    He noted in this regard his status as Dean of the Diplomatic Corps. I said that
                    the Secretary-Designate was not seeing any Ambassadors prior to his confirmation
                    and that I did not think an appointment would be possible.</p>
                <p>(I confirmed this to the Soviet Embassy July 10.)</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">INF–<gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>
               </p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> took a rather negative view about
                    both negotiations. He observed that INF had been going on for many months but
                    the two sides seemed as far apart as ever and he could not see any realistic
                    prospect for achieving agreement. He agreed with me that the <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> talks had begun in a businesslike and
                    serious manner but said this was hardly unusual. He thought the positions of the
                    two sides seemed so different that little progress was in prospect.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">LEBANON</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked if a reply had been made to
                    the latest letter from <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                    concerning Lebanon.<note n="4" xml:id="d193fn4">See <ref target="#d192">Document
                            192</ref>.</note> I said that it had not been, but that the President
                    was considering it and would respond in due course. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> went over again the substance of his remarks concerning
                    the situation in Lebanon which he made in his call on me July 7, with particular
                    reference to the announced intention of the U.S. to send a Marine contingent to
                    Beirut. He said he could not understand the rationale for an international force
                    and that, in any event, he felt that U.S. forces should not be sent. If it were
                    really necessary to have an international force, then it should be done
                    preferably under <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> auspices and using forces
                    which would not include the U.S.</p>
                <p>I explained in detail our views regarding the need for strengthening the central
                    government of Lebanon and achieving peace. In this regard, as a first step it
                    was necessary to resolve the question of the evacuation of the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> from West Beirut. The idea of an international
                    force and of the inclusion of a U.S. contingent had been suggested by the
                    Lebanese. I noted that we would not send the Marines unless all parties agreed
                    and I stressed that their stay in West Beirut would be temporary, not to exceed
                    30 days.</p>
                <p>Referring to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s letter, I
                    commented that some of the language could be interpreted as being threatening in
                    nature. I also could <pb n="638" facs="0669" xml:id="pg_638"/>not understand why
                    the Soviets had seen fit to publish almost immediately the substance of the
                    letter; this violated the traditional confidential character of correspondence
                    at the highest level.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> squirmed a bit at this saying
                    that, while the Soviets generally wished to observe the principle of
                    confidentiality, the publication of the substance of the <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> letter in this instance was an
                    indication of the Kremlin’s concern about the proposed move by the U.S. to put
                    its soldiers into Beirut. He said so long as the conflict preserved a regional
                    character involving Israelis, Palestinians and Syrians, it could be regarded as
                    something regrettable but not of major concern. He remarked that “we would never
                    go to war for the Syrians, and we told the Syrians that”. However, if the U.S.
                    forces enter the picture, then a new element is introduced—that of the
                    U.S.-Soviet relationship. The Soviet Union is a super power like the United
                    States, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said, and it should be
                    understood that it would have to react in some way if the U.S. introduced its
                    forces. He could not predict what the consequences would be, but there would be
                    consequences.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> continued that the Soviet
                    leadership is elderly and it could be said that this has an advantage in that
                    old men don’t want to take risks or get involved in new problems. At the same
                    time, they cannot be seen as “chicken”. If the U.S. puts Marines into Lebanon,
                    an area not far removed from the Soviet Union, it could be seen by some as a
                    challenge to the Soviet Union and this is bound to produce a reaction.</p>
                <p>I emphasized again our peaceful intent and the limited nature of our involvement
                    if it occurs. I made clear that we would proceed with our plans if there is
                    agreement with all parties concerned.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">LAW OF THE SEA</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he understood that we would
                    be announcing our opposition to signing the Law of the Sea Treaty. He was
                    puzzled, since he thought the U.S., like the Soviet Union, believed that the
                    provisions in the treaty covering navigational passage through straits, etc.,
                    were advantageous.</p>
                <p>I explained the problems we had with the portion of the treaty concerning the
                    deep seabed mining regime and said that the treaty as it stood could never be
                    ratified by our Senate.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> commented that, while he could
                    understand our objection to some of the terms of the seabed regime, he did not
                    see why we could not go along with the treaty as a whole, particularly since, by
                    our refusal to sign, we would be isolating ourselves from almost all other
                    nations.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">SOVIET UNION—INTERNAL</p>
                <p>In answer to my query, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he
                    was not aware of any Central Committee Plenum to be held this summer. While one
                    could <pb n="639" facs="0670" xml:id="pg_639"/>be called on short notice, his
                    personal view was that this was unlikely, given the absence of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> from Moscow and the vacation plans of
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> this summer.</p>
                <p>I inquired whether <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> would be
                    chairing meetings of the Politburo in <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s absence. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he did not know for certain. He remarked that,
                    before he died, <persName corresp="#p_SMA_1">Suslov</persName> had always taken
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s place in chairing the
                    Politburo. After <persName corresp="#p_SMA_1">Suslov</persName>’s death,
                        <persName corresp="#p_KAP_1">Kirilenko</persName> assumed this role. More
                    recently, <persName corresp="#p_KAP_1">Kirilenko</persName> has not been active
                    because of failing health and <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName>
                    took over the chairmanship in <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                    absence. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> acknowledged that
                        <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> has become “increasingly
                    active” recently and he thought that there might be some system whereby
                        <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName> would alternate in taking the
                    Politburo chair when <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> was not
                    there. He stressed, however, that he did not know for sure.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> speculated that <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> may have been made responsible for
                    ideological affairs previously supervised by <persName corresp="#p_SMA_1">Suslov</persName>. If this is the case, it might also be that <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName> is responsible for personnel matters
                    in the Party. Again, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said this
                    was all speculation on his part.</p>
                <p>Speaking of <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he had always found him easy to
                    deal with. He is a man with long experience in government and foreign affairs
                    and is generally well informed about the world.</p>
                <p>Commenting on the organization of the Foreign Office, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> to an increasing extent is delegating day-to-day
                    activities to his deputies, reserving to himself only items of major importance.
                    The two deputies are <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> and
                    Maltsev. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> is the person <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> relies on the most; he is a
                    professional who is thoroughly capable and experienced. On the other hand,
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said that Maltsev, while a
                    very good person, has primarily Party background (although he did serve as
                    Ambassador to Sweden) and is not generally as capable of handling the details of
                    foreign affairs as is <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> recalled that when Kuznetsov had
                    left the Foreign Office position as First Deputy several years ago for the
                    Presidium, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had wanted him
                        (<persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>) to take Kuznetsov’s place.
                    However, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> related, <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had objected to such a move, saying
                    that <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> would be more useful in the
                    United States in view of his long experience here. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asserted that he was quite content with this decision
                    and that he preferred to be in Washington rather than in the Foreign Office in
                    Moscow.</p>

                    <item>Talking Points for Your Meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>, Monday, July 12, 1982</item>
                </list>
                <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> has requested a
                    meeting with you in order to secure information. The information he most likely
                    seeks has to do with the President’s thinking about political, economic, and
                    military matters, especially as these bear on the Soviet Union. Some of the
                    President’s recent actions—notably his London speech,<note n="2" xml:id="d194fn2">See <ref target="#d177">Document 177</ref>.</note> which
                    rattled them severely, and the extension of sanctions—have thrown confusion into
                    the Politburo. The prevalent view there had been that <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Ronald Reagan</persName> would sooner or later succumb to
                    Allied pressure and the force of U.S. public opinion and adopt a more
                    conciliatory position <hi rend="italic">vis-a-vis</hi> Moscow. His move in the
                    opposite direction in June, combined with the concurrent departure of <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>, seems to indicate to Moscow some major
                    shift in U.S. foreign policy the drift of which they would like to know. This is
                    of particular importance at this time since some of them seem to have concluded
                    (Tab I)<note n="3" xml:id="d194fn3">Not found attached.</note> that “the
                    President is now in command of foreign policy”. (S)</p>
                <p>I believe that it is good for us that they are uncertain and confused: this tends
                    to make them hesitant and less aggressive. It would not serve much purpose for
                    you to clarify in <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s mind what
                    our strategy is, for once they know it is easier for them to prepare effective
                    countermeasures. It would be best therefore if, to the extent possible, you drew
                        <hi rend="italic">him</hi> out on such subjects as:</p>
                <p>—Soviet position on Afghanistan: Do they really regard the situation there as
                    “irreversible” (<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s words to
                        <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>)? How long do they intend to
                    wage this losing war?</p>
                <p>—Soviet pressure on Poland: Do they believe that by preventing any kind of
                    liberalization in Poland they will be able to solve Poland’s catastrophic
                    economic situation?</p>
                <pb n="641" facs="0672" xml:id="pg_641"/>
                <p>—Concerning their own economic situation: How do they expect to overcome in the
                    future a steadily falling rate of economic growth and perennial agrarian
                    failures?</p>
                <p>—Will they show flexibility in INF and <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>
                    negotiations instead of reiterating fixed positions?</p>
                <p>—Is authority in Moscow at present in secure hands? (You need not be embarrassed
                    to ask—he will understand we must know if there is someone there we can deal
                    with.) (S)</p>
                <p>It will be hard to get him to talk but gentle persistence may do the trick.
                    (S)</p>
                <p>In response to his questions, I would stick to fixed, declared positions:</p>
                <p>1. Sanctions: We intend to adhere to them (Gelb’s article<note n="4" xml:id="d194fn4">Reference is to Leslie H. Gelb, “<persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> is Seeking Ways to Moderate Poland
                        Sanctions,” <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, July 9, 1982, p.
                        A1.</note> was without substance) until and unless there is <hi rend="italic">significant</hi> improvement in Poland.</p>
                <p>2. INF and <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>: The President is determined
                    to obtain <hi rend="italic">equitable reductions</hi> and we are not likely to
                    be worn out by Soviet intransigence to the point where we will start negotiating
                    among ourselves. At the same time we do not strive for military superiority as
                    is mistakenly asserted in Moscow.</p>
                <p>3. Middle East: The current crisis is the result of Soviet support of Syria and
                    the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> which between them have destroyed
                    Lebanon; Israel will not stay there once foreign troops are out. No return to
                    previous situation of threatening Israel from Lebanon.</p>
                <p>4. Summit: This can take place only if and when much progress has been made on
                    outstanding differences between us: not in the cards yet. (S)</p>
                <p>On all other questions I would be evasive and/or vague. (S)</p>
                <p>You may want to make it clear that this meeting was exceptional, that you
                    normally do not deal with Ambassadors and that in the future he should
                    communicate with <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>; otherwise he
                    may feel he has opened a new “channel”. (S)</p>

                </list>
                <p>The highly unusual Soviet decision to make public the substance of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s July 7 letter to you on Lebanon<note n="2" xml:id="d195fn2">See <ref target="#d192">Document 192</ref>.</note>
                    reflects growing Soviet alarm that U.S. forces might successfully be deployed in
                    Beirut in the context of a settlement orchestrated by U.S. diplomacy. The
                    Soviets probably are apprehensive that such an outcome would confirm the
                    ascendency of the U.S. and Israel in the Middle East and further accelerate the
                    erosion of Soviet influence and prestige throughout the region. Thus, the public
                    release of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s letter is almost
                    certainly intended to impede the emerging, but still tenuous, Beirut
                    settlement.</p>
                <p>Specifically, the Soviets probably hope that the public warning contained in
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s letter will:</p>
                <p>—Appear responsive to <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> and other Arab
                    pressure for more concrete Soviet support in the crisis, thereby stiffening
                        <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> resolve to resist further concessions
                    in the interest of a settlement.</p>
                <p>—Complicate our efforts to obtain French participation in a multilateral
                    peacekeeping force for Beirut by making clear that the GOF would be acting in
                    the face of a Soviet warning, however vague.</p>
                <p>—Erode international support for deployment of a multilateral force, by
                    suggesting that any such deployment first receive endorsement by the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council.</p>
                <p>The tone and substance of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                    warning is, in itself, relatively low-key, and so was <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s handling of it with me. The Soviets
                    presently have few good military options for response to an actual or impending
                    deployment of U.S. forces, given the overwhelming Israeli superiority on the
                    ground, the weakness of the Soviet Union’s regional clients, and the presence of
                    strong U.S. naval forces in the area.</p>
                <p>However, the decision to make <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                    warning public will itself generate pressure on the Soviet Union to respond in
                    some visible way, or see Soviet international credibility erode even further.
                    Moscow might either privately or publicly insist that its forces be included in
                    any multinational force organized for Beirut.</p>
                <pb n="643" facs="0674" xml:id="pg_643"/>
                <p>The Soviets could further increase their naval presence in the Mediterranean or
                    increase the visibility of their resupply efforts to Syria. It is conceivable
                    that Moscow might even consider a limited deployment of Soviet ground forces to
                    Syria, although Soviet forces would almost certainly be kept well away from
                    areas where they might become involved in direct combat with Israeli forces. Of
                    course, to the extent that the Syrians and other Arabs had agreed to the
                    arrangements under discussion, the Soviets would find it difficult to elicit an
                    invitation for such a deployment.</p>
                <p>In order to limit the impact of the release of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s letter on our efforts to settle the Beirut crisis, we
                    should adopt a firm, but measured course of action involving:</p>
                <p>(1) A reply from you to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> which
                    rejects the outrageous allegations in his letter and makes clear both that we
                    are the promoters of peace in the area and that his warning will not affect our
                    determination to take the actions necessary to bring about a settlement of the
                    crisis. We believe that this letter should be delivered as soon as possible. A

               </p>
                <p>(2) A presentation to the French Ambassador pointing out how mild and ambiguous
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s warning actually is. We
                    would provide the French Ambassador with a thorough briefing on my meeting with
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> and, if possible, provide
                    him with the outlines of the reply which you will make to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>.</p>
                <p>(3) Immediate instructions to <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Phil Habib</persName>
                    and Sam Lewis containing assurances for the Beirut parties and the Israelis that
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s warning will in no way
                    affect our determination to press forward urgently with efforts to nail down a

                    <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I have received your letter of July 7.<note n="2" xml:id="d196fn2">See <ref target="#d192">Document 192</ref>.</note>
               </p>
                <p>The suffering of the people inhabiting Lebanon, about which your letter speaks,
                    is indeed tragic and requires most urgent action by all the parties involved to
                    bring about the restoration of peace in Beirut and the rest of Lebanon. I do
                    wish to call your attention, however, to the fact that the current fighting in
                    Lebanon is the inevitable consequence of the violation in the 1970s of Lebanese
                    territory by Syrian and <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> forces which
                    established an armed presence there. These forces have divided the country into
                    hostile, warring regions and used it as a base for aggression against Israel.
                    The Israeli incursion of last month thus is one of the effects and not the cause
                    of the tragedy.</p>
                <p>The United States is hoping for a lasting solution of the problem. This objective
                    demands, first and foremost, the removal of the armed forces of all the foreign
                    powers and movements from Lebanon and the creation of conditions under which the
                    Government of Lebanon is once again able to exert effective authority throughout
                    its country. Any other interpretation of United States objectives and efforts in
                    this region is without foundation. This holds particularly true with regard to
                    the actions of my personal emissary in the area, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Philip Habib</persName>. Thanks in large part to his
                    tireless and imaginative diplomacy an opportunity has been created for a
                    peaceful resolution of the present conflict in Beirut. It is my firm resolve
                    that the United States do everything in its power to help achieve such an
                    outcome.</p>
                <p>Discussions in Beirut have now reached a critical phase in which all parties
                    involved must make the difficult decisions required for progress toward peace.
                    In this context, the Government of Lebanon has raised the possibility of limited
                    deployment of military units, including a U.S. component, to assist that
                    government in reestablishing its authority in Beirut and facilitating the
                    departure of outside armed <pb n="645" facs="0676" xml:id="pg_645"/>forces from
                    that city. As we have declared publicly, the United States would consent to such
                    a deployment only at the express invitation of the Government of Lebanon and
                    with the approval of the parties to the negotiations. If deployed in Beirut,
                    U.S. forces would remain there only for the limited time necessary to accomplish
                    the objectives I have described. These forces would then be withdrawn. This is
                    not only morally sound policy; it is also a course dictated by prudence, for as
                    experience shows, any attempt by outside powers to impose their military will on
                    the people of the Middle East can only lead to such powers becoming bogged down
                    in a bloody and humiliating quagmire.</p>
                <p>Although the crisis in Lebanon is at an extremely sensitive stage, I want to take
                    this opportunity to reiterate my deep concern about the situation in Poland. In
                    our view, conditions in that troubled country have not improved since the
                    imposition of martial law seven months ago. The United States and its Allies
                    have made clear our considered view as to what is needed to bring about a
                    process of national reconciliation in Poland. Without a significant improvement
                    in the internal conditions of Poland, it will be all the more difficult to make
                    the kind of progress I would like toward improved U.S.-Soviet relations. I urge
                    you to help Poland return to the path of national reconciliation and peaceful
                    development.</p>
                <p>Let me close, Mr. President, by expressing my concern at your decision to make
                    public the substance of your letter of July 7, thereby breaching the
                    confidentiality of our personal exchanges. This action cannot contribute to the
                    easing of the current crisis.</p>
                <p>Sincerely,</p>

                </list>
                <p>I have now gone over the <gloss target="#t_memcon_1">memcons</gloss> of <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s talks with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> on June 18 and 19, 1982.<note n="2" xml:id="d197fn2">See
                            <ref target="#d186">Documents 186</ref> and <ref target="#d187">187</ref>.</note> The general impression is one of wasted effort.
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> restated in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> cases standard Soviet positions and would not budge an inch from
                    them. His tone throughout was condescending, sometimes snide and downright rude.
                    Much of the time he lied through his teeth. While clearly we need to maintain
                    this channel of communications with Moscow, I wonder if it really serves any
                    useful purpose for the Secretary of State to spend so much time with his Soviet
                    counterpart to go over and over well-traversed ground and be subjected to the
                    same verbal humiliation. My recommendation would be for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>, if he proposes to meet <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, to devote initially no more than one
                    morning or afternoon to a preliminary dialogue and continue only if there is
                    some sense of genuine progress. (S)</p>
                <p>Basically, the material presented in this <gloss target="#t_memcon_1">memcon</gloss> duplicates that from the two previous encounters (<persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> September 1981 and January 1982) so I will not bother to
                    go into detail. All the familiar themes are here: the United States is
                    belligerent and seeks military superiority, the Russians have no desire to
                    export revolution, we should be friendly to Cuba, the Israelis and we are
                    responsible for all the trouble in the Middle East, and so on and so forth.
                    (S)</p>
                <p>On the two issues which you specifically mentioned to me, I have the following to
                    report:</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">Poland</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                    restated the Soviet position that what went on in Poland is a purely internal
                    Polish affair: “no representative of the Soviet Government will discuss this
                    problem with any other country in the world”. Consistent with this viewpoint,
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> refused to be drawn into any
                    discussions on the situation in Poland. Nowhere did he promise a lifting of the
                    martial law or linking our relaxation of sanctions with possible Polish
                    reforms.</p>
                <pb n="647" facs="0678" xml:id="pg_647"/>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">Nicaragua</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                    complained that we are bullying Nicaragua which has no hostile intentions toward
                    us. The issue of MIGs in Nicaragua never came up: all discussion on this
                    country, as on all other subjects was maintained by the Soviet side on a
                    Himalayan level of platitude. (S)</p>

                    announced by General <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Jaruzelski</persName> on July
                    21 failed, to any significant degree, to meet the three Allied conditions for
                    removing sanctions on Poland. We will be working closely with our Allies during
                    the next few days to develop a coordinated response to the Polish actions. Thus
                    far, Allied reactions to <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Jaruzelski</persName>’s
                    speech appear generally consistent with our own, and there appears to be a good
                    prospect for maintaining unity on this issue.</p>
                <p>In view of your concern for the Polish situation and your desire to avoid a
                    dispute with the Allies on our response to <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Jaruzelski</persName>’s speech, I want to call to your attention the
                    serious problems which would arise should you make a decision on the US-<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> grain agreement, as I understand you
                    currently intend, early next week. As you know, I believe that from the
                    perspective of foreign policy, our interests would be best served by a decision
                    to extend again the existing agreement at current levels. However, in raising
                    this issue, I am not questioning the basic decision; only its timing. Our first
                    meeting with the Allies in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> to compare our
                    assessments of developments in Poland is scheduled for July 26. By the end of

                <p>As you know from your meetings last month in Europe, the Allies claim to see a
                    contradiction between our continuing grain sales and our sanctions on industrial
                    items which impact negatively on European sales to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Although the European contention can be refuted, it is a fact
                    which we must take into account in our relations with the Allies. There is a
                    risk that a decision on the grain agreement prior to the completion of our
                    consultations with the Allies could result in Allied decisions to take
                    unilateral steps on Poland. Some sanctions might be lifted, while pressure could
                    develop to reschedule the Polish debt. We would in all likelihood refuse to
                    reschedule, which would create yet another painful public dispute between us,
                    the only beneficiaries of which would be <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Jaruzelski</persName> and the Soviets.</p>
                <p>For these reasons, I urge that you postpone a decision on the grain agreement
                    until approximately August 1, by which time we should have completed our
                    consultations with the Allies, thus avoiding risks to Allied unity essential for
                    effective pressure on Poland. I also believe that we should make every effort,
                    when you make your decision, to give the Allies advance notification and
                        explanation.<note n="3" xml:id="d198fn3">On July 30, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> announced that he was authorizing

                    August 1.</p>

                <p>Mr. President,</p>
                <p>I write you again in connection with the situation in Lebanon. You have
                    undoubtedly been informed that the night of July 31–August 1 the Israeli forces,
                    having again perfidiously broken the ceasefire, undertook a massive offensive on
                    West Beirut. Peaceful residents are being ruthlessly killed, the city is being
                    destroyed.</p>
                <p>It cannot escape one’s notice that this perfidious attack followed soon after all
                    members of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council, with the
                    exception of the US, had voted for a resolution demanding that Israel raise the
                    siege of West Beirut. A conclusion suggests itself that there is a direct link
                    between the US position, as it has manifested itself, inter alia, in the
                    Security Council, and what Israel is perpetrating in Lebanon. Tel Aviv could not
                    act so impudently if it did not feel that it enjoys the support of the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>The tragedy of Lebanon, and especially of the population of its capital, will be
                    an indelible stain on the conscience of those, too, who could have stopped the
                    aggressor, but have not done so.</p>
                <p>I urgently call upon you, Mr. President, to use in a speediest manner the
                    possibilities at your disposal in order not to permit continued annihilation of
                    people in Beirut. The situation is so serious—I would say, critical—that the
                    most urgent measures are required.</p>

                    <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I have received your letter of August 2.<note n="2" xml:id="d200fn2">See <ref target="#d199">Document 199</ref>.</note>
               </p>
                <p>As I have said in response to your previous letters, the United States deeply
                    regrets the suffering of the people of Lebanon, and is making every effort to
                    bring about an end to the tragedy through the removal from Lebanon of the armed
                    forces of all foreign powers and movements as well as the restoration of the
                    Lebanese Government’s effective authority throughout the country. Contrary to
                    the assertion in your latest letter, we have worked closely with other members
                    of the United Nations to support constructive international efforts at resolving
                    the crisis, as our vote for the Security Council resolution of August 1 clearly
                    demonstrated.</p>
                <p>I must, therefore, categorically reject the insinuation in your letter that the
                    United States encouraged the Israeli side to break the ceasefire this past
                    weekend, or on any other occasion. As I have stressed before, we shall continue
                    our active diplomatic efforts in search of the humane and peaceful goals which
                    we seek. I hope that the Soviet Union would do nothing to make a resolution of
                    this tragedy more difficult.</p>
                <p>I may add that although the United States Government and Israel maintain close
                    and friendly relations, we are not responsible for the actions of the Israeli
                    Government, a sovereign state. If, therefore, the Soviet Government has
                    representations to make in this regard, it should communicate directly with the
                    Israeli authorities.</p>
                <p>Mr. President, I also feel compelled to reiterate my concern at your unilateral
                    decision to make public once more the substance of one of your letters thereby
                    breaching the confidentiality of our personal exchanges. Such actions devalue
                    this privileged channel of communication, and raise serious doubts about the
                    Soviet Union’s interest in a peaceful resolution of the Lebanese crisis.</p>

                </list>
                <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> has prepared a report which raises the
                    question whether the Soviet Union, facing mounting economic problems, may at
                    some point decide to shift resources from arms production to civilian uses.</p>
                <p>Without committing itself to an answer, the report stresses the great
                    difficulties inherent in such a policy change. By its very nature the Soviet
                    economy finds it much more difficult to shift resources from the defense sector
                    to the civilian one than is the case in market economies. While in the United
                    States the expansion or contraction of the defense sector is essentially a
                    factor of the defense budget, in a planned economy like the Soviet one, the
                    process is infinitely more complicated. There one must make not only a budgetary
                    adjustment but also put through changes in highly complex production plans,
                    reallocate financial, material and human resources, etc., all of which are
                    directed by the state.</p>
                <p>The study assumes that the Soviet Government could, if it so wishes, make a 20
                    percent cut in defense expenditures by the late 1980s. It believes such a cut
                    would have appreciable effects on the ailing economy. All the branches of the
                    Soviet military would have to bear the burden of the cuts except the strategic
                    forces which would emerge relatively intact. Western policies would play a major
                    role in such a development. “The credit, goods, food and technology provided by
                    the West have helped Moscow maintain its current resource allocation scheme.”
                    Denial of such assistance would produce additional pressure on the leadership to
                    shift resources from military to civilian uses.</p>
                <p>The report warns that such a shift, once it occurred, would be difficult to
                    monitor, at any rate, in its early phases.</p>

                  <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreword</p>
                  <p>As the Soviet economy continues to deteriorate, more and more attention is being
                    given to the notion that at some point the leadership might attempt to prop up
                    the Soviet Union’s faltering economy by shifting some resources from arms
                    production to civilian end uses. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not
                        declassified</hi>]</p>
                  <p>To be sure, there is no evidence that any resource shift is under way, or even
                    that Soviet leaders are seriously contemplating one; the dominant feature of
                    Soviet defense spending has been the persistence of its growth. Nevertheless, as
                    economic problems mount—and as the struggle for leadership intensifies in
                    Moscow—the possibility of a resource shift requires that Western policymakers
                    have some grasp of the Soviet system’s technical capacity to accommodate such a
                    shift if, in fact, a decision of this sort were to be reached or even
                    considered. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not declassified</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Apart from ideological imperatives, perceived national security needs, and the
                    personal commitment of Soviet leaders to growing military power, the very
                    structure of Soviet defense planning and production, which is vastly different
                    from ours, contributes heavily to the momentum of defense spending in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and makes any shift of resources out of the
                    defense sector more difficult than would be the case in a market economy. [<hi rend="italic">Portion marking not declassified</hi>]</p>
                  <p>In the United States, the allocation of resources for the production of both guns
                    and butter is carried out in the free market. Government’s role is to allocate
                    enough money to provide the minimum number of guns judged necessary to assure
                    the national security. A political decision to expand or contract the US
                    military sector, once reached, is implemented merely by raising or lowering the
                    defense budget. The free market then reallocates resources, and it is an
                    efficient mechanism for doing so. By contrast, the entire Soviet system—with its
                    five-year <pb n="653" facs="0684" xml:id="pg_653"/>plans, its comprehensive
                    resource-allocation process, its command economy—is designed and managed by the
                    government to provide a high priority to defense production. A political
                    decision to alter the guns-vs.-butter ratio requires far more from the
                    government than merely a budgetary adjustment: production plans must be changed;
                    financial, material, and human resources must be reallocated; production must be
                    rescheduled in government plants; and the actual goods and services that emerge
                    must be given prices and assigned to customers—all by government officials. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not declassified</hi>]</p>
                  <p>After briefly outlining the Soviet industrial structure, this paper examines the
                    technical capacity of the Soviet Union to shift resources from military-related
                    production to civilian end uses—<hi rend="italic">assuming a Politburo decision
                        to attempt such a shift.</hi> It examines the time that a significant
                    resource shift would require and the impact of such a shift on the Soviet
                    Union’s economic performance and military prowess. After outlining the role of
                    Western economic assistance in maintaining the Soviet Union’s current resource
                    allocation scheme, this paper discusses the difficulties that the US
                    Intelligence Community would have in detecting and monitoring a resource shift
                    from arms production to civilian end uses. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking

                  <p rend="sectiontitleital">Key Judgments</p>
                  <p>On the basis of observed military activity, we expect that Soviet defense
                    spending will continue to grow 4 to 5 percent a year through at least 1985.
                    Sustaining this policy over the long term will be increasingly difficult,
                    however, especially if economic conditions worsen beyond our projections.
                    Indeed, a new leadership by mid-decade will feel greater pressure to reduce the
                    growth rate of defense expenditures to free up labor, capital, and
                    materials—resources urgently needed in key civilian sectors. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not declassified</hi>]</p>
                  <p>An absolute cut in defense spending on the order of 20 percent by 1990—a
                    hypothesis discussed in this paper—could result in meaningful economic changes.
                    A gain in per capita consumption growth of up to one percentage point a year
                    would be likely, and there could be a moderate increase in the growth of <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>. We believe such an abrupt shift is highly
                    unlikely in the short run. If it were made at all, it would be phased in
                    gradually after 1985. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not
                    declassified</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Absolute cuts would almost immediately free up raw materials and some
                    semifinished goods such as high-quality steels, construction materials,
                    chemicals, and fuels. These could help eradicate bottlenecks in such critical
                    economic sectors as energy, agriculture, and transportation. Many military
                    production facilities could begin producing goods for the civilian sector within
                    a reasonable period of time. Capacity currently used in armored vehicle and tank
                    production, for example, <pb n="654" facs="0685" xml:id="pg_654"/>could be
                    converted in roughly a year to support increased production of a broad range of
                    civilian vehicles—for example, railway rolling stock, tractors, trucks, and
                    construction equipment. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not
                    declassified</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Absolute cuts in military programs would probably impact most on theater air,
                    naval, and land arms, possibly causing a major restructuring of missions and
                    postponing replacements. The Soviet strategic forces could emerge relatively
                    intact. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not declassified</hi>]</p>
                  <p>The military would object strongly to a resource shift of this magnitude, but the
                    objections would be manageable once the Politburo decision was final. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not declassified</hi>]</p>
                  <p>The credit, goods, food, and technology provided by the West have helped Moscow
                    maintain its current resource allocation scheme. If the West were able to deny
                    or limit Moscow’s access to these forms of assistance, pressure would be
                    increased on the Soviet leadership to shift resources from arms production to
                    the civilian economy. By curtailing the Soviets’ import capacity—primarily by
                    restricting credit but also by hampering their oil and gas production and thus
                    their hard currency exports—the West would further raise the cost to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> of maintaining its present resource
                    allocation policy. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not declassified</hi>]</p>
                  <p>It is, of course, impossible to say for certain that the Soviets would respond to
                    Western pressure by shifting resources. However, it is important to note that in
                    some instances they have deemed a shift to be in their best interests and have
                    directed the military-industrial complex to support the civilian economy. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not declassified</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Monitoring Soviet weapons production by intelligence methods is extremely
                    difficult. Thus it is highly possible that should Soviet leaders in fact shift
                    some resources from arms production to civilian end uses—especially if the
                    magnitude of the shift is smaller than hypothesized in this paper—the change
                    could go unnoticed for quite some time. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not

                </list>
                <p>The attached talking points for your August 21 “seminar” identify four broad
                    areas of discussion:</p>
                <p>—Soviet assets and vulnerabilities</p>
                <p>—Current Soviet policy</p>
                <p>—US leverage and priorities</p>
                <p>—Building public support</p>
                <p>Below, under the same four headings, are themes, problems, and propositions you
                    may want to put before the group. They should provide the structure for a very
                    general review of Soviet-American relations. Three narrower questions—linkage,
                    arms control prospects, and a summit—are more fully developed in brief tabs.</p>
                <p>One theme that recurs in every section below (and deserves special emphasis at
                    the outset) is the difference between the bilateral half of our relationship and
                    our broader efforts to create an environment in which we can limit Soviet
                    openings and resist Soviet advances. The Soviet-American competition is, to a
                    large extent, governed by each side’s relationship with third parties—with
                    allies and proxies, with local troublemakers and their targets. Yet both those
                    who want us to be tougher with the Soviets <hi rend="italic">and</hi> those who
                    want us to ease up too often treat <hi rend="italic">bilateral</hi> dealings as
                    the core of the competition. The first group, for example, treats pipeline
                    sanctions as the ultimate test of our strength, no matter the impact on the
                    Alliance; the second envisions fine-tuned leverage toward the Soviets, while
                    demanding nothing more of Alliance relations than lowest-common-denominator
                    unity.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Areas for Discussion</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                  <hi rend="roman">1.</hi> Soviet Assets and
                    Vulnerabilities</p>
                <p>a) <hi rend="italic">How will the Soviets manage their economic crisis?</hi> In
                    the group’s discussion of Soviet assets and vulnerabilities (most of them now
                    well known), you will hear an increasing emphasis on Soviet resource
                    constraints. This is important, but incomplete: we need to know how the <pb n="656" facs="0687" xml:id="pg_656"/>Soviets will resolve the choices and
                    conflicts created by these constraints. We should not think they will face a
                    simple choice between <hi rend="italic">reallocation</hi> (economic growth, but
                    less for defense) and <hi rend="italic">turning to the West</hi> (economic
                    growth, but under tight leverage). Soviet problems are unquestionably severe,
                        <hi rend="italic">but</hi> in dealing with them the Soviet leadership knows
                    that:</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">some of them could change quickly</hi> (substantial price
                    increases for gold and energy could cut Soviet mid-decade credit needs almost in
                    half),</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">some will change during this decade</hi> (labor-force growth
                    turns back upward by 1990), and</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">some may never change</hi> (low productivity and poor
                    resource-management reflect structural defects of the Soviet system).</p>
                <p>These facts may encourage the leadership to keep muddling through: the obstacles
                    to systemic reform are, in today’s more institutionalized system, probably even
                    greater than they were 20 years ago; great increases in Western resources may
                    not seem worth the economic (or, possibly, political) price. Finally, even if
                    resources <hi rend="italic">are</hi> reallocated, nothing we now know tells us
                    that completely new priorities will govern the decisions.</p>
                <p>b) <hi rend="italic">How will the Soviets manage the burden of the bloc?</hi> The
                    outline of Soviet policy is firm: bloc living-standards will decline. The Polish
                    experience has unsettled the Soviets, but two of its chief lessons will suggest
                    a cautious, conservative policy:</p>
                <p>—Steady reduction in living standards <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be imposed and
                    weathered.</p>
                <p>—Even small socio-political <hi rend="italic">experiments are very
                    dangerous</hi>.</p>
                <p>If this is the Soviet reading, we must expect recurrent repression in the bloc as
                    a backdrop of our management of East-West relations.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                  <hi rend="roman">2.</hi> Current Soviet Policy</p>
                <p>a) <hi rend="italic">How do the Soviets see their own position?</hi> Reduced
                    internal flexibility does not always reduce flexibility in foreign policy. <hi rend="italic">Can the Soviets minimize the impact of their internal
                        vulnerabilities on their foreign policy interests?</hi> If so, how? In the
                    short run, obvious opportunities exist, for example, in pursuing the following
                    goals.</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">In Europe:</hi> to promote West European independence,
                    espeially in East-West trade; to blunt the President’s arms control proposals;
                    to limit European support for US policy on issues like Poland, Afghanistan, or
                    southern Africa.</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">In the Third World:</hi> to preserve and exploit the proxy
                    positions built up over the past decade, perhaps to regain or compensate for
                    lost ground in the Middle East; to keep the costs of the Afghan war at their <pb n="657" facs="0688" xml:id="pg_657"/>present low level; and more generally,
                    to divide the West from the Third World (using pressure on Pakistan or Somalia,
                    for example, to show the dangers of close association with the US).</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">In arms control:</hi> to move the talks toward preserving
                    present imbalances, or to weaken political support for Western defense
                    programs.</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">In East Asia:</hi> to create at least the appearance of
                    movement toward better relations with China; failing that, to isolate China.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">These goals will not be attained easily, but they are not
                        narrowly dependent upon resources. And they do not require high risk or
                        high-cost initiatives that would further expose the Soviet position</hi>. In
                    light of problems in Eastern Europe and within the leadership, this
                    consideration will help to sustain Soviet self-confidence.</p>
                <p>b) <hi rend="italic">How do the Soviets see this Administration?</hi> It is often
                    said that they are uncertain about US policy. This <hi rend="italic">uncertainty</hi> can have two different forms:</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">first</hi>, whether they can do business with us at all,
                    and</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">second</hi>, whether we mean what we say and will stay the
                    course (especially given our own political and resource constraints).</p>
                <p>The Soviets may doubt <hi rend="italic">both</hi> points. Thus, to clarify our
                    basic message to them, we must demonstrate:</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">first</hi>, that we do not deny their legitimate interests
                    (narrowly defined), or aim simply to overturn their system, <hi rend="italic">and</hi>
               </p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">second</hi>, that their conduct has <hi rend="italic">exceeded</hi> their legitimate interests, and we will make this costly for
                    them.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                  <hi rend="roman">3.</hi> US Leverage and Priorities</p>
                <p>a) <hi rend="italic">What leverage can restrain Soviet behavior? Most problems of
                        Soviet-American relations can be resolved</hi> above all (perhaps only) in
                    an environment that limits Soviet opportunities—that is, <hi rend="italic">by a
                        favorable military balance, by active cooperation with friendly states, and
                        by political stability and economic growth</hi>. The prime task of our
                    Soviet policy even in the short term is to increase such leverage.</p>
                <p>This Administration, however, also claims to favor “<hi rend="italic">linkage</hi>”—between Soviet conduct and our readiness to cooperate on
                    other issues. Exercise of linkage has always been very hard, and it may become
                    more so:</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">Arms control (though some call it a prime Soviet goal) may be
                        a progressively less effective restraint</hi>. The radical <hi rend="italic">Soviet</hi> concessions we propose reduce the Soviet stake in reaching an
                    agreement. And the mere <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> of negotiating may seem less
                    likely to slow US weapons programs than it did five years ago; in fact,
                    especially in INF, <hi rend="italic">lack</hi> of negotiations might best stop
                    Western programs.</p>
                <pb n="658" facs="0689" xml:id="pg_658"/>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">Economic incentives may also be ineffective, despite Soviet
                        difficulties</hi>. Free-market systems are resistant to use as leverage, and
                    lack of Western unity further limits the economic <hi rend="italic">penalties</hi> we can impose; because Soviet economic problems are
                    systemic, the <hi rend="italic">benefits</hi> of East-West trade may be marginal
                    too. The scale of Soviet problems may make marginal differences more important
                    than usual, but our own recession will also increase opposition to regular use
                    of such linkage.</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">Soviet human rights policy—an appropriate and permanent issue
                        of our bilateral relations</hi>—may be quite unstable during the succession.
                    Offering inducements for liberalization in this period may be tempting (and
                    useful for p.r. reasons), but leadership instability may preclude enduring
                    results.</p>
                <p>—Finally, <hi rend="italic">geopolitical issues are hard to trade off against
                        each other</hi>. The Soviets will cede valuable positions in the Third
                    World—as in southern Africa—only under substantial US leverage. Yet our room to
                    maneuver is slight. In area after area <hi rend="italic">we</hi> want something
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Soviets</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">You should ask the

                <p>Significantly, many urgent problems about which you may hear from the group
                    concern third parties directly and the Soviets only indirectly. Yet each affects
                    our ability to deal with the Soviets.</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">Restoring Alliance unity</hi>. Since unity of inaction will
                    not protect the West in the long term, it is essential to find ways of acting
                    together effectively. The immediate cause of disunity is Poland. Friendly
                    critics should be asked what policy package can <hi rend="italic">both</hi>
                    allay allied unhappiness <hi rend="italic">and</hi> effectively strengthen our
                    Polish policy (the President’s prime condition). If there is none in the short
                    term, how can this problem best be made less urgent?</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">Countering Soviet proxies</hi>. The Soviets are perhaps best
                    positioned, by proxy, to do imminent damage to our policy in southern Africa. If
                    they prove able to block Cuban withdrawal from Angola, what additional leverage
                    can strengthen our position? The growing likelihood of such an impasse (and of
                    other Soviet proxy probes) makes a common front with our Allies (now in
                    question) all the more important.</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">China</hi>. Severe downgrading would reverse one of the major
                    accomplishments of US policy in the last 15 years, with domestic and
                    international costs. Has this triangle become so difficult to manage because the
                    Chinese take US anti-Sovietism for granted? Can the Soviets exploit this? How
                    can we move the Chinese back to an interest in strategic cooperation?</p>
                <pb n="659" facs="0690" xml:id="pg_659"/>
                <p>c) Finally, <hi rend="italic">can we do better than damage-limitation in the
                        medium term?</hi> A firm US policy and the Soviets’ own difficulties may
                    well persuade them to hunker down over the next several years—cautiously
                    awaiting both a more receptive US administration and an upswing in their own
                    downturning indicators.</p>
                <p>Such <hi rend="italic">a Soviet pause may be a working definition of US success
                        for the medium term</hi>. Does it, however, miss opportunities, created by
                    developing Soviet difficulties, to put the relationship on a better long-term
                    basis? These opportunities might lie in the direction <hi rend="italic">either</hi> of more actively weakening the Soviets <hi rend="italic">or</hi> of more energetically seeking out ways to resolve differences on
                    favorable terms. How can we identify and explore such opportunities as they
                    appear?</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">How can we correct the public confusion about our Soviet</hi>
                    policy?</p>
                <p>Soviet efforts to divide the West against itself will be encouraged by, among
                    other factors:</p>
                <p>—uncertain public support if arms talks stagnate,</p>
                <p>—the apparent inconsistency of our trading policies, and</p>
                <p>—the contradictory picture of Soviet aggression and weakness.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Our strengths lie in the enduring power of the human rights
                        issue, in our openness to negotiation, and our diplomatic activism in
                        resolving conflicts</hi>. Yet in trying to convey consistency, firmness, and
                    balance, we face this <hi rend="italic">dilemma:</hi>
               </p>
                <p>—Harsh and ideological rhetoric, particularly when directed at the Soviet <hi rend="italic">system</hi> rather than at Soviet behavior, may seem likely
                    only to increase tensions (and thereby the public’s fear of war). Emphasizing
                    the need to overturn Communism may in fact set a standard by which we will be
                    seen to <hi rend="italic">fail</hi>.</p>
                <p>—Failure to emphasize our ideological differences, however, may signal
                    business-as-usual and make it harder to defend costly policies. It also
                    surrenders a key basis of Allied unity—the common commitment to Western
                    values.</p>

                    of our policy; Tab C discusses how a summit might strengthen this effort.)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Issue:</hi> The Agency has been able to procure from a
                    well-placed Soviet source a survey of the views and attitudes which the Soviet
                    ruling elite (<hi rend="italic">nomenklatura</hi>) has of itself and its
                    society. It is very rare that we obtain such a detailed and authoritative
                    insight into the self-image of the Communist apparatus.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi> The Soviet source seems to enjoy excellent
                    access to the high levels of the Soviet bureaucracy, especially to the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>, which is in the best position to know how
                    things really stand in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. The picture
                    which he paints is very pessimistic:</p>
                <p>—There is widespread feeling among the Soviet elite that Soviet society is sick,
                    that the Communist Party has lost prestige, and that things cannot go on the way
                    they are.</p>
                <p>—Crime and corruption are rampant and increasing: robberies, muggings and murder
                    have become common, but even more so are bribery and theft of state property in
                    which the militia actively participates. (Even the ex-head of the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>, is not safe as unknown thieves had taken several fur
                    hats from a rack outside his office in the Liubianka.)</p>
                <p>—Workers and peasants are dissatisfied with economic conditions and unwilling to
                    work.</p>
                <p>—The account stresses the deep animosity of the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> toward the Party for the unique privileges it enjoys, and
                    toward the militia for its corrupt practices. The <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> is unhappy that it cannot restore “order”.</p>
                <p>—The source is pessimistic about the possibility of significant reform after
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> departs and expects a return
                    to Stalinism, which would entail severe repression for theft of state property
                    and dissent, as well as a hard line in foreign policy. These measures may work
                    in the short run, the source believes, but not in the long one, and he <pb n="661" facs="0692" xml:id="pg_661"/>darkly hints at the possibility of
                    revolution. (There seem to be numerous weapons illegally held by private persons

                  <p rend="center">THE MALAISE OF SOVIET SOCIETY</p>
                  <p>1. In recent years there has been a growing feeling of malaise in most sections
                    and at most levels of Soviet society. People simply no longer believe in the
                    Party. They do not think in terms of problems being overcome by changes in the
                    leadership, but rather that the whole party system has to be done away with.
                    Young people even say as much in the presence of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s grandchildren. Only careerists are willing to talk
                    about their faith in the system as if they believe what they are saying.</p>
                  <p>2. Over the years, the gradual increase in corruption and theft by party
                    officials has encouraged more and more people to see what they can get out of
                    the system for themselves—with ever decreasing concern about the legality of
                    what they are doing. This malaise had been reflected in both the growth and the
                    pattern of Soviet crime. Certain parts of Moscow and other big cities are no
                    longer considered safe after dark. There has been a sharp increase in the number
                    of muggings by teenagers and the number of murders committed in general. The
                    authorities are worried by the fact that the proportion of murders committed
                    without a known motive has now risen to 80 percent.</p>
                  <p>3. Robberies from private flats used to be virtually unknown in the Soviet Union.
                    Now, however, people are so worried that they install double doors and burglar
                    alarms (wired via the telephone system) in their homes. Despite such precautions
                    the apartments of violinist David Oistrakh and other leading artists have been
                    burglarized, as have those of Ministry of Foreign Affairs (and even <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>) officials. Public concern has been heightened
                    by revelations that some of the militia, which control the burglar alarms, have
                    been working in conjunction with professional thieves.</p>
                  <p>4. There has also been a steady rise in the number of armed robberies of big
                    stores, jewelry shops, banks and couriers delivering wages <pb n="662" facs="0693" xml:id="pg_662"/>to big enterprises. Such robberies are now
                    frequent enough occurrences for them to be mentioned in novels, which they never
                    were before.</p>
                  <p>5. Nowadays no place seems to be safe from thieving fingers—even the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> Headquarters in Lubianka. Yuriy Andropov,
                        <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> Chief, would still like to know who
                    stole six fine fur hats belonging to important visitors from the hat stand
                    outside his office in the latter 1970’s. (Fearing that more than hats might
                    leave the inner sanctum of the Lubianka unnoticed, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> then ordered a high security “screen” to be built
                    around his suite of offices.)</p>
                  <p>6. Despite this malaise there are few, if any, signs that crime has acquired a
                    distinctly political focus. There is little political graffiti to be seen and
                    such armed attacks as there have been on party officials have usually been in
                    the republics. In the short term terrorist attacks are more likely to come from
                    national minorities (e.g. the bombing of the Moscow Metro by three Armenians)
                    than from European Russians themselves.</p>
                  <p>7. The story of the Soviet leadership’s recent efforts to cover up corruption in
                    high places and details of some of the things which have been going on in the
                    militia provide vivid vignettes of the present state of Soviet society.</p>
                  <p rend="sectiontitleital">THE DISCONTENTED GROUPS</p>
                  <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                     <hi rend="roman">INDUSTRIAL WORKERS</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. The serious food shortages in recent years have added to the discontent of the
                    working class with their generally low standard of living, the shortages of
                    consumer goods, the “failures” of the system and the resentment they feel about
                    the privileges enjoyed by senior party officials.</p>
                  <p>9. The authorities have long felt that alcohol was an essential opiate for the
                    Soviet people in general, and the working class in particular. People are well
                    aware that the authorities make reusable caps for the bottles of vodka which are
                    exported, but not those sold in the home market. Once a Soviet man opens his
                    bottle he is expected to finish it. In 1971 a secret party directive went so far
                    as to recommend that local authorities should open liquor shops close to the
                    entrances of all major plants. At the same time the authorities launched an
                    official campaign against alcoholism. In the recent past much official concern
                    has been expressed about the increase in alcoholism in the Soviet Union, but the
                    authorities have not really tried to combat the problem. Prices have gone up,
                    but supplies are still good and are consumed just as quickly as before.</p>
                  <p>10. Workers can often be heard saying that they do not care whether they are
                    employed by a capitalist “boss” or the state, so long as the <pb n="663" facs="0694" xml:id="pg_663"/>money is good—and there is something worth
                    buying with it. In the past workers said such things in public when drunk. Now
                    they frequently say them when sober.</p>
                  <p>11. The more skilled the worker, the less fear he has of voicing his discontent.
                    If the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> suggests a skilled worker should
                    lose his job because of what he has said, the factory manager and the party
                    secretary are likely to defend him because they cannot replace him easily.</p>
                  <p>12. Discontent, aggravated by food shortges, has already led to many brief
                    strikes. The two major strikes of 1981 were at Gorkiy and Togliatti. By the
                    spring of 1981 meat and milk shops in Gorkiy had been closed for months. Unrest
                    and tension had been growing. Without warning stoppages broke out one day in
                    several separate parts of the Gorkiy plant. Within a short while the strike had
                    spread and production was at a standstill. The next day the meat and milk shops,
                    miraculously well stocked, reopened. Production restarted at the plant without
                    delay. There were no arrests and at the time the authorities made no attempts to
                    find strike leaders. The main interest, as usual, was hushing up the matter as
                    quickly as possible.</p>
                  <p>13. Despite the authorities’ efforts a similar pattern of events soon unfolded in
                    the nearby major car plant at Togliatti. Again the workers were bought off with
                    improved food supplies.</p>
                  <p>14. Efforts to modernize industrial practices have also run into difficulty. At a
                    number of plants the introduction of piece rates has been badly handled.
                    Productivity has usually shot up quickly in response to the incentives of the
                    new system. This has made the authorities think they set the piece rate too
                    high. They think that they will still be able to get much of the increase in
                    production they want even if they pay a lower piece rate. Cuts in piece rates,
                    however, have usually led to strikes. One of the most important of these strikes
                    took place a few years ago at the tractor plant at Volgograd.</p>
                  <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                     <hi rend="roman">AGRICULTURAL WORKERS</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. The great majority of agricultural workers want collective farms (the
                    Kolkhoz), in effect to be broken up—at least into small cooperatives, if not
                    independent farms. They argue that only such a reorganization, together with a
                    freer market for their produce, will give them the type of incentives they need
                    to increase their output significantly.</p>
                  <p>16. Recent regional experiments have shown production can be increased
                    significantly when small groups are allowed to farm land for their own profit
                    (i.e. the Zveno/“Link”/System). The party leadership, however, has rejected the
                    idea that Soviet agriculture should be remodelled on these lines. They are
                    simply terrified by the prospects of people having an independent economic base,
                    free to a large extent from party control.</p>
                  <pb n="664" facs="0695" xml:id="pg_664"/>
                  <p>17. During the past couple of years state help for private plots has increased
                    and price controls have been removed on sales at the officially sanctioned
                    private markets. These changes, however, have only produced a slight improvement
                    in supplies from that sector. Most farmers have found, of course, that they need
                    to sell less to earn the same amount of money. As the choice of goods they can
                    buy is not great, they have little incentive to earn more cash.</p>
                  <p>18. The food program to 1990, approved by the Central Committee Plenum on 24 May
                    1982, is unlikely to produce a significant increase in output. There will still
                    be far too much bureaucracy interfering with farming decisions and price
                    incentives will not be great enough for the agricultural workers. In these
                    circumstances the investments planned under the program will neither be very
                    productive, nor will they really overcome some of the main structural problems
                    of Soviet agriculture.</p>
                  <p>19. One of the key problems of Soviet agriculture stems from the fact that rural
                    life in much of the country is very disagreeable. In European Russia, for
                    example, collective farms are usually unprofitable and rundown. The majority of
                    young people have drifted to the cities. It will be a long time before
                    conditions improve sufficiently to encourage young people to stay on the farms,
                    let alone bring them back from the cities. After all industry, too, is eager to
                    get more labor.</p>
                  <p>20. In the Ukraine the situation is somewhat better. Agriculture there has been
                    fairly profitable for many years. This has made it possible to improve the
                    quality of rural life. As a result a good proportion of young people have
                    remained on the land—which in turn has helped production and profitability. But
                    retaining manpower and winning it back are very different matters.</p>
                  <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                     <hi rend="roman">THE INTELLIGENTSIA</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. At present the most influential members of the intelligentsia are the
                    writers. Many of them are, in reality, both subtle and profound critics of many
                    aspects of the Soviet system. They not only find ways to criticize the negative
                    side of Soviet society, but they also articulate the discontent of a large
                    number of people against the Soviet system as a whole.</p>
                  <p>22. Influential writers today tend to be against the party, for less antagonism
                    between classes in Soviet society and for a greater pride in Russian
                    nationalism. The <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> watches such writers
                    closely, but most of their books are still published. The leading members of
                    this group include Vladimir Soloukhin, Valentin Pikul, and Valentin Rasputin, as
                    were Gil Lepatov (who wrote critically about local party officials), Vasili
                    Shukshin and Vladimmir Vysotsky (the very popular poet/singer) who kept on
                    protesting until their recent deaths.</p>
                  <p>23. Soloukhin’s novel about a peasant who wished to restore a 13th century church
                    conveys well the way these writers get across their <pb n="665" facs="0696" xml:id="pg_665"/>message. The peasant in this novel feels so strongly about
                    the importance of saving his village church from delapidation and collapse that
                    he is willing to restore it himself. He gives up drink to save the money to buy
                    the materials he needs to supplement his own building skills. All he wants from
                    the authorities is permission to restore the church (which for him is symbolic
                    of Russia and its historic greatness). No one in the local administration or the
                    local party or the next level up is willing to give him the go ahead. In the end
                    this good peasant, frustrated and enraged, throws away his tools, gets drunk and
                    curses Soviet society.</p>
                  <p>24. Pikul, in his books, has continued to develop his theme that Russians should
                    be proud of their history. Generally speaking, he argues, Russia had great
                    Tsars, good rulers and good political leaders before the October revolution.
                    This is one of the themes of his book “At the Limit,” which dealt with the last
                    period of Tsarism. Suslsov was enraged by the fact that Pikul did not even make
                    the slightest reference to the Bolsheviks. But Pikul still writes and his books
                    are published. One way or another he conveys the same message.</p>
                  <p>25. Among the non-literary intelligentsia <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName> still commands much respect. His academic standing, his
                    personal history and the fact that he remains in the country tend to override
                    any criticism people may voice about his links with the West or some of the
                    advice he has given the West (e.g. his call to the West to increase its military
                    strength). In some intellectual circles <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName>’s confinement in Gorkiy is often referred to by the
                    words “Lenin in exile.”</p>
                  <p>26. The dissident movement itself enjoys little public support, even in
                    intellectual circles. The writers referred to above and their supporters feel
                    that the Soviet Union must solve its own problems, in its own way, and in its
                    own good time. The public dissidents are disliked because of their links with
                    the West. Moreover, it is generally felt that these groups (for example, the
                    Helsinki Monitoring Group) are little more than devices which Jews unable to
                    leave the Soviet Union use to further their own cause, not that of “Russia.”</p>

                     <hi rend="roman">THE MILITIA (POLICE)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>27. The militia is one of the least discontented, yet most disliked, groups in
                    Soviet society. The reason is simple—the militia is doing so well through
                    corruption. These days militiamen are mainly former soldiers from the provinces
                    who have come to Moscow and Leningrad, in particular, in the hope of cashing in
                    on the local corruption. They have become brazen enough to take bribes from
                    almost anyone, even from known <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>
                    officers.</p>
                  <p>28. The most corrupt group in the militia is the one responsible for
                    investigations into the theft of state property). These militiamen <pb n="666" facs="0697" xml:id="pg_666"/>have numerous opportunities to take bribes and
                    to ask for them. They have become deeply involved in the activities they are
                    supposed to be stopping. Corruption in the militia has become such a serious
                    matter that the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> is trying to persuade the
                    party to let them have the responsibility for investigating theft of state
                    property.</p>
                  <p>29. The militia is also involved in organized crime, including murder. At the
                    lower end of the scale, the militia is involved in robberies from homes of some
                    of the more prosperous Soviet citizens where they have installed the burglar
                    alarms (via the telephone system). At the other end of the scale, groups of
                    militia have been discovered murdering well-to-do people for their apparel and
                    personal possessions.</p>
                  <p>30. The most infamous case took place in 1978/80. During that period a number of
                    people had disappeared without trace. The <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>
                    got involved when one of <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s
                    senior colleagues (his personal adviser on personnel matters) joined the list of
                    those missing. A massive <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> operation was
                    mounted to discover what had happened to him. After many months the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> discovered a group of 25 militiamen, headed by
                    a Lieutenant Colonel, which had murdered more than 20 people for their
                    possessions and had then effectively disposed of the bodies. Other similar
                    groups were exposed later.</p>
                  <p>31. As a result of these exposures and other incidents, relations are now
                    extremely bad between the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> and the militia.
                    If ever arrested by the militia, <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> officers
                    have instructions to conceal their true function. The reason is that the militia
                    is believed to be so keen to embarrass the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>
                    that they will even fabricate the evidence if they think they can get away with
                    doing so. A more important reflection of the leadership’s view of the militia is
                    that the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> expects that it will soon be
                    allowed to recruit agents in the militia, something which it has been forbidden
                    to do for many years.</p>
                  <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                     <hi rend="roman">THE <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>

                  </p>
                  <p>32. Within the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> there is a strong feeling
                    that “something needs to be done to put this country in order.” The <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> is particularly disgruntled by its inability
                    to take effective action against those it believes are undermining “society,”
                    particularly dissidents and the party itself. Legally, the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> has difficulty in stopping the expression of
                    anti-regime sentiments. A man, even in the Soviet Union, is entitled to his
                    personal opinion. He only commits an offense when he tries to encourage others
                    to pursue anti-Soviet activities. Skilled workers are usually protected by their
                    employer and the local party secretary, almost regardless of what the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> says. The <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>
                    resents having to “caution” dissidents, instead of being able to take executive
                    action against them.</p>
                  <p>33. The other problems connected with dissidence have also been preoccupying the
                        <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>. For some years the Soviet authorities
                    have been <pb n="667" facs="0698" xml:id="pg_667"/>worried about the use which
                    might be made in periods of social unrest of the sizeable amounts of
                    unauthorized weapons in private hands and the illegal presses used for printing
                    Samizdat.</p>
                  <p>34. Although the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> has had some success in
                    collecting weapons, greater quantities of arms continue to be smuggled out of
                    arms factories (e.g. at Tula and Kovrov). Most of these weapons are small arms,
                    but the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> believes that some heavier items,
                    still in working order, have remained concealed since the Second World War,
                    mainly in the western part of the Soviet Union and the Caucasus. Tracking down
                    these weapons has remained one of the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>’s top
                    priorities since the mid 1970’s.</p>
                  <p>35. The <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> has had no difficulty in monitoring
                    the circulation of Samizdat publications and the authorities have not been
                    unduly concerned by the tone of their contents. What has been more disturbing
                    for the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> (and for the authorities) is the
                    little success it has had in locating the illegal printing presses. The
                    authorities fear that in more troubled times these presses will be used to print
                    inflammatory leaflets, posters, etc.</p>
                  <p>36. Even more resentment in the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> is caused by
                    the Party’s privileges and the abuse of its powers. Party secretaries at the
                    raikom (district) level and other party employees of that rank and above enjoy
                    extensive privileges, including access to special food shops. Compared to their
                    party colleagues the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>, the Army and the
                    government, even though they are also party members and hold equally senior
                    positions, only receive small perks.</p>
                  <p>37. The <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> knows a lot about corruption and
                    straight theft from state enterprises. It has great difficulty, however, in
                    getting charges brought against those concerned for the simple reason that they
                    are protected by their party position or their connections. Rarely is the Party
                    willing to do more than chide the offenders. The Party, <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> officers often say, wants to maintain its isolation from
                    society and protect itself from prying eyes. It also wishes to avoid its laundry
                    being washed in public. Scandal is to be avoided if at all possible.</p>
                  <p>38. If the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> acquires incriminating evidence
                    against a party official (or the close relative of a senior party member) it is
                    under strict instructions to take no further action and to report the matter
                    directly to the head of the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>. During the
                    many years <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> headed the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> he claimed that he would deal with the matter
                    “personally” and in his party capacity as a member of the Politburo. It was
                    noticeable that despite the evidence he received rarely did anything ever happen
                    to the accused. Many <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> officers feel that
                    this sense of “discretion” is one of the main reasons <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> is acceptable to the Party.</p>
                  <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                     <hi rend="roman">THE ARMY</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>39. There is widespread belief among Army officers that the Party has shown
                    itself incapable of running the country—either by Stalinism <pb n="668" facs="0699" xml:id="pg_668"/>or through reform. Some middle ranking
                    officers, including lecturers at the General Staff Academy, go so far as to tell
                    friends that sooner or later someone will lead a coup d’etat against the Party.
                    The Army dislikes and resents the Party because of the general state of the
                    country, the Party’s involvement in corruption and theft and because party
                    officials’ privileges are much greater than those enjoyed by Army officers of
                    equal standing.</p>
                  <p>40. Although the Army wishes to see change, it is generally opposed to the idea
                    of a return to Stalinist policies. One of the main reasons for this is the
                    Army’s memories of the purges of the 1930’s. The Army, and particularly the
                        <gloss target="#t_GRU_1">GRU</gloss> (Soviet Military Intelligence), has
                    never forgotten the enthusiasm with which the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> (then known as the NKVD) had pursued its role as “the armed
                    detachment of the party.” Moreover, the Army dislikes what it views as the close
                    symbiotic relationship between the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> and the
                    Party.</p>
                  <p>41. For all of the Soviet dislike of the state of affairs in Poland, many Soviet
                    Army officers (including some senior officers) view with a certain interest the
                    role which Premier <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Wojciech Jaruzelski</persName>
                    and the Polish Armed Forces are now playing in the country’s affairs.</p>
                  <p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS</p>
                  <p>42. Until a few years ago many of the younger officials believed that it was
                    still possible for the Soviet Union to follow the path of gradual economic
                    reform which in due course would widen the margins of cultural freedom and
                    political debate. Few people still believe such hopes can be realized. Within
                    Soviet society, these younger officials see widespread discontent with the Party
                    from the industrial and agricultural workers, the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>, the Army and the intellectuals. Moreover, they see a party
                    which seems incapable of overcoming the problems which it faces because it is
                    preoccupied with preserving its own position.</p>
                  <p>43. In 1920 Lenin had written (in “Left-Wing Communism, an Infantile Disorder”)
                    that: “only when the ‛lower classes’ do not want the old, and the ‛upper
                    classes’ cannot continue in the old way, can the revolution be victorious.” Many
                    of the younger officials are beginning to feel that the Soviet Union is moving
                    closer and closer to such a situation.</p>
                  <p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
                  <p>44. There is little prospect that after <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> leaves the political scene the Soviet leadership will
                    embark upon a more systematic program of reform.</p>
                  <p>45. In some respects the Party itself has become one of the discontented sections
                    of Soviet society. It still has its privileges, but it is less <pb n="669" facs="0700" xml:id="pg_669"/>sure about how much authority it can command.
                    Economic problems pose the most serious threat to the Party’s position.</p>
                  <p>46. The influence of detente and the general erosion of discipline in Soviet
                    society have led to growing criticism of Soviet institutions and the regime in
                    general. To embark on reform in any circumstances would be to court disaster. In
                    Eastern Europe some experimentation can be tolerated because if the situation
                    gets out of hand there, Soviet troops are on hand to reassert control; if things
                    go wrong in the Soviet Union itself, however, no one will protect the party.</p>
                  <p>47. Given the tensions within Soviet society a return to a more Stalinist policy
                    is quite possible. <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s recent
                    appointment as a party secretary will facilitate such a move, but it is not
                    dependent upon him replacing <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> as
                    General Secretary.</p>
                  <p>48. If more draconian domestic policies are pursued the main features will
                    probably be:</p>
                  <quote>
                     <p>A. A propaganda campaign claiming that the Soviet Union is seriously
                        threatened by the West.</p>
                    <p>B. Severe penalties for theft of state property and associated corruption
                        (e.g. food destined for state shops is often sold in cooperative shops, with
                        the connivance of the state shops who take cut of the profits).</p>
                    <p>C. Tough <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> measures against any form of
                        anti-socialism.</p>
                  </quote>
                  <p>49. Initially, such draconian measures can win the acceptance, even favor of some
                    discontented elements in Soviet society. In the medium and longer term, however,
                    the measures will lose their impact. The main reason for this is that the Soviet
                    people have become more difficult to control individually and there are now so
                    many of them who are discontented. As draconian measures cannot overcome these
                    problems, discontent will build up and an incident could, at some stage, unleash
                    a crisis.</p>
                  <p>A PROBLEM BECOMES A CRISIS</p>
                  <p>50. Many Soviet people believe that industrial unrest could easily lead to
                    clashes with the police and workers being shot. Bloodshed, in turn, could lead
                    to massive and spontaneous demonstrations against the authorities. Large scale
                    protests could not easily be stopped by the authorities quickly buying off the
                    demonstrators with improved food supplies as happened in Gorkiy and Togliatti in
                    1981. If demonstrations burst out in several places, the authorities would not
                    be able to provide supplies quickly enough to keep everyone happy.</p>
                  <p>51. A more serious problem for the authorities, however, is the weakening of the
                    cohesion and discipline of Soviet society which has taken place in recent years.
                    This could make it very difficult for the authorities to regain control of the
                    situation.</p>
                  <p>52. Faced with widespread demonstrations the Party would have to call in the
                    Army. European conscripts would be most reluctant to <pb n="670" facs="0701" xml:id="pg_670"/>fire on other Europeans voicing similar discontents to
                    their own. <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> troops might fire on
                    demonstrators at first, but it is doubtful for how long they would hold the
                    line. The authorities would try, no doubt, to use non-European troops to
                    re-establish order. Given the present structure of the Soviet Army, however,
                    this would not be easy—particularly to move them quickly to the areas where they
                    were needed. The outcome of such clashes would be unpredictable. Bloodshed could
                    soon lead to widespread violence. Faced with social unrest other discontented
                    groups could well turn against the Party—and one of the discontented groups is,
                    after all, the Army. If that happened the Party would have little chance of
                    surviving in its present form.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Introduction</p>
                <p>A Review will be conducted of U.S. Policy Toward the Soviet Union. This National
                    Security Study Directive establishes the Terms of Reference for the Review.
                    (S)</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Objectives of the Review</p>
                <p>The Review will assess the nature of the Soviet threat to U.S. national security
                    interests in the short and long terms, with emphasis on its non-military
                    aspects, and recommend appropriate U.S. policy responses, by:</p>
                <p>—Analyzing the determinants of Soviet foreign policy and domestic policies of
                    concern to the U.S. and other outside powers;</p>
                <p>—Assessing Soviet strengths and weaknesses;</p>
                <p>—Identifying key elements of likely continuity and change in the Soviet system

                    costs and obstacles involved in using them. (S)</p>
                <p>The Review will proceed on the premise that Soviet international behavior is
                    determined not only by the external environment but also by political, economic,
                    social and ideological features of the Soviet system itself. It will produce a
                    paper for consideration by the National Security Council, and subsequently, for
                    decision by the President. (S)</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Scope of the Review</p>

                    ascertain what realistic expectation one can have of significant changes in the

                    such changes are likely to make the country more or less threatening, and in
                    which areas. The question of non-evolutionary (violent) collapse of the system
                    from within and its implications for U.S. security will also be considered.

                <p>At the outset I passed a note to <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Hal
                        Sonnenfeldt</persName> which I thought ought to frame the basic discussion.
                    Basically it posed the question, <pb n="674" facs="0705" xml:id="pg_674"/>“What
                    should our goals be—to concentrate on changing the internal structure and
                    objectives of the Soviet system or, to concern ourselves pragmatically with the
                    external manifestations of the Soviet policy which threaten Western interests.
                    In short, should we be motivated by ideological concerns and try to change the
                    Soviet Union, or should we accept it as a fact of life subject to only
                    evolutionary change and concern ourselves with its containment?”</p>
                <p>The discussion brought forth an extremely rich commentary from both schools with
                    the preponderant tilt being toward the latter course—that is, to concerning
                    ourselves with the external manifestations of Soviet policy and try to limit
                    them, bearing in mind that this strategy gives you collateral pressure for
                    internal Soviet change anyway. In this regard, <persName corresp="#p_RHS_1">Harry Rowen</persName> (<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>) noted that a
                    pragmatic policy of limiting Soviet expansion will bring the Soviet Union to a
                    strategic decision within ten years when the burden of defense expenditures
                    deprives all other accounts to an unacceptable degree.</p>
                <p>The discussion then shifted to how best to translate those goals and that
                    strategy into real world policies. Don Rumsfeld and Pete Peterson made extremely
                    persuasive presentations on the point that our policies must be sustainable for
                    the long haul, and that we must avoid the polar extremes of the past ten years
                    in which we ask the American people to support either a soft-headed detente or
                    an unyielding hard-line confrontation (with the broad swings in defense
                    expenditures which accompany these poles). In short, our policy must be simple
                    and oriented toward the long term in order to be understood and thus
                    sustainable.</p>
                <p>It was not possible to translate this conceptual framework into specific policy
                    prescriptions in the areas of trade, arms control and defense spending although
                    some individual views were expressed and one or two points of consensus emerged.
                    Specifically, all agreed on the need for sustaining a steady strengthening of
                    our military strength and on the need for a restrictive trade policy (although
                    most participants acknowledged that there were some political goals such as
                    Allied cohesion which could justify exceptions to this restrictive approach). As
                    a separate but related matter it was generally felt that we should concentrate
                    our arms control efforts on INF (as opposed to <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>) since it is in that area that we will reap greatest
                    political gain with our Allies.</p>
                <p>The discussion went on for about six hours. Perhaps its greatest benefit will
                    derive from the enrichment it provided to insiders who will be participating in
                    the recently launched <gloss target="#t_NSSD_1">NSSD</gloss> on U.S.-Soviet

                    instead on dealing with its external manifestations as they affect U.S.
                    interests (State’s approach). I expect that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> may task additional analysis within the
                    Department to follow up today’s meeting as he did following his Middle East

                    the <gloss target="#t_NSSD_1">NSSD</gloss> framework (which would best serve our
                    interests).</p>

                <p>You opened Saturday’s meeting by asking the participants’ view of the Soviet
                    Union and of the relationship we should seek with it. The discussion that
                    followed brought to light <hi rend="italic">three fundamentally different
                        approaches to Soviet-American relations</hi>, with disagreements among them
                    centering on whether and how the two sides’ competition can be moderated. There
                    was the familiar disagreement between the view that it can be moderated only by
                    the <hi rend="italic">break-up</hi> of the Soviet Union, and alternately, the
                    view that it can be adequately moderated by the right <hi rend="italic">bargaining</hi> approach on issues that affect Soviet interests. A third
                    analysis, which emphasized the importance of <hi rend="italic">blocking</hi>
                    Soviet opportunities, assumed no fundamental moderation is possible.</p>
                <p>Not every participant, of course, fits neatly into the following description of
                    these views. This is sometimes due to shadings in their view, sometimes to
                    outright contradiction.</p>
                <pb n="676" facs="0707" xml:id="pg_676"/>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Three Outlooks</p>
                <p>1. For the <hi rend="italic">bargainers</hi>, the key to a satisfactory
                    relationship lies in positioning ourselves to maximize our bilateral leverage.
                    There is a potential for mutual accommodation, created by the vulnerabilities of
                    the Soviet system (and resultant Soviet caution). Yet to exploit this potential
                    several steps are needed: trade must increase substantially, the U.S. government
                    must acquire the legal power <hi rend="italic">and</hi> flexibility to control
                    trade, and we must earn European confidence and cooperation by setting out a
                    balanced strategy for using this leverage. To further strengthen this
                    cooperation, we must also assign the highest priority, not only to conducting
                    arms talks, but to the early conclusion of an agreement, even though its impact
                    on the overall balance is expected to be negligible. The <hi rend="italic">bargainers</hi> favor other agreements as well, and express confidence that
                    the use of rewards and penalties will facilitate “rules of the game” for
                    competition in the Third World. Although based on a picture of Soviet weakness,
                    this view foresees an enduring relationship even as the weakness passes: our
                    task is to limit the Soviet Union’s misbehavior, and this will be possible even
                    as it prospers.</p>
                <p>2. For the proponents of <hi rend="italic">breaking the Soviet Union up</hi>, the
                    West’s only choice is between a Soviet demise and the “Finlandization” of
                    Europe. With no basis left for a stable relationship, contacts must be kept to a
                    minimum. Arms control merely unravels our defense efforts, and trade merely
                    creates reverse leverage against the West; in this way, the Soviets have
                    exploited Western internal weakness in the past. Now, however, the application
                    of economic pressures is the key to Western success: the Soviet Union’s internal
                    weakness (above all, its economic crisis) is great enough to bring it down,
                    if—and only if—<hi rend="italic">the US squeezes</hi>. To do so requires the
                    same government control over economic relations that the bargainers desire. On
                    the basis of such an all-out struggle, the problem of managing Western public
                    opinion can also be solved: our leaders, rather than offer a complex and
                    multi-faceted relationship with the enemy, can now hold out victory. (They do
                    not, however, have to scare our people: the pressure tactics of the <hi rend="italic">break-up</hi> school are “risk-free.”)</p>
                <p>3. Those who focus on <hi rend="italic">blocking Soviet misbehavior</hi> spell
                    out the implications of concluding that the competition cannot be fundamentally
                    moderated: first, that <hi rend="italic">overturning the Soviet system requires
                        more leverage than we have</hi>; second, that <hi rend="italic">bargaining
                        directly with the Soviets—on trade or arms control—gives us less leverage
                        than we need</hi>. Effective leverage comes instead from creating an
                    environment in which Soviet opportunities are limited, and Soviet advances can
                    be resisted—through an improved military balance, cooperation with like-minded
                    states, and promotion of political and economic stability. <hi rend="italic">Trade and arms control are not incompatible with this approach</hi>, but
                    the <hi rend="italic">marginal</hi>
                    <pb n="677" facs="0708" xml:id="pg_677"/>benefits they yield must be strictly
                    weighed against the confusing signals they send our own public. <hi rend="italic">Economic pressures are also not incompatible</hi>, but because
                    they too yield only <hi rend="italic">marginal</hi> benefits these have to be
                    weighed against the damage done to our efforts to promote cooperation and unity
                    with other states.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Assessment</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">All</hi> three of these outlooks are found in the
                    Administration, and obviously have some ground in common. In particular, all
                    emphasize the importance of pursuing a policy that can sustain public support
                    over the long term. You heard some sophisticated advice from all sides about
                    managing this difficult problem:</p>
                <p>—The <hi rend="italic">bargaining</hi> partisans point out that a showy openness
                    to negotiation is not enough. To command the public and allied support that will
                    strengthen our negotiating hand, we need a convincing strategy that promises <hi rend="italic">results</hi>, that can get from here to there.</p>
                <p>—The <hi rend="italic">break-up</hi> advocates would sustain public support by
                    stating our differences with the Soviets in maximum terms, in principled,
                    ideological rhetoric.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Yet both of these analyses expect to put the Soviet-American
                        relationship on a new basis</hi>, and for this reason they may <hi rend="italic">compromise sustainability for other goals</hi>. For
                    example:</p>
                <p>—The <hi rend="italic">bargainers</hi> set an extremely stiff test for showing
                    that our policy is realistic and effective: in this way an early arms agreement
                    becomes a top priority. The paradoxical conclusion is that <hi rend="italic">the
                        only way to sustain a long-term competitive posture is to satisfy the
                        public’s desire for an end to competition</hi>. In practice, this may be
                    simply self-defeating.</p>
                <p>—The <hi rend="italic">bargainers’</hi> view of economic leverage makes the same
                    compromise. To strengthen our hand in the long run, we have to increase the US
                    share of East-West trade; in the short run, this is not likely to convince our
                    allies to practice restraint. If it does not, our leverage will not
                    increase.</p>
                <p>—The <hi rend="italic">break-up</hi> school similarly compromises its long-term
                    prospects for a massive effort in the short run. Our allies and our publics will
                    demand early results, which may prove unattainable.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Implications</p>
                <p>The problem of sustainability, by contrast, looks most acute to those who
                    envision continuing Soviet opportunities throughout (and beyond) this decade.
                    The <hi rend="italic">blocking</hi> strategy you heard at the meeting rejected
                    our bilateral leverage toward the Soviets as marginal. In this view, there is
                    less to be gained and more to be lost by nuanced use of rewards and penalties.
                    The key word here is “simplicity.” The economic, diplomatic and security
                    dimensions of our policy must be consistent.</p>
                <pb n="678" facs="0709" xml:id="pg_678"/>
                <p>This seemed to me a very powerful line of argument. The Soviet Union retains
                    considerable flexibility and our policy must serve us whether the Soviets hunker
                    down for a few years or take a more confrontational line. One difficult problem
                    is left unresolved, however: our approach to negotiation. The public wants
                    consistency but it also wants all means for resolving conflicts explored. And
                    those who have least hope of moderating the competition for good are <hi rend="italic">always</hi> suspected of negotiating half-heartedly.</p>
                <p>If we are not to be whip-sawed by these conflicting pressures, we need <hi rend="italic">a fuller negotiating strategy</hi>, particularly for arms
                    control, but extending to other areas as well. We run risks whether we stand
                    indefinitely by radical proposals or fall back to positions that seem to call
                    the competition off. To resolve this problem, we need to see the fundamental
                    difference between agreements that put the competition on a new, qualitatively
                    safer basis and those that affect it marginally at best. In the right
                    circumstances, either one <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be acceptable as long as we
                    know—and the public knows—which is which. If we are settling for second-best, it
                    should be <hi rend="italic">clear</hi> that we are settling, and that the
                    broader competition goes on. An innovative approach (botched in the follow-up)
                    to solving this problem was the <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>
                    Administration’s March 1977 double offer on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>: letting the Soviets choose between major and marginal change.
                    Our problems are a bit different now, but this may not be a bad model for our
                    relationship as a whole.</p>

                        Soviet Union</item>
                </list>
                <p>On Friday, August 27, I attended a State-chaired interagency meeting convened to
                    task drafting responsibilities of <gloss target="#t_NSSD_1">NSSD</gloss> 11–82,
                    a U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union. At the meeting, State distributed an
                    outline which differs in part from the Terms of Reference signed by <pb n="679" facs="0710" xml:id="pg_679"/>the President. Specifically, their outline
                    omits an introduction, a section detailing the objectives of the directive<note n="2" xml:id="d207fn2">An unknown hand underlined “introduction, a section
                        detailing the objectives of the directive.”</note> and recommended policies
                    for the U.S. These sections are crucial in providing the appropriate background,
                    overview and focus that the directive needs. During the meeting, State also
                    recommended that only <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and State should
                    draft the directive, thus excluding <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> and all
                    other agencies. Hence, I proposed that <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                    should draft the introduction and the section on the objectives of the review
                    and should work jointly with State on recommended U.S. policies. My suggestions
                    were met with resistance by State. I, therefore, propose that you authorize
                        <persName corresp="#p_PR_2">Richard Pipes</persName> to secure State’s
                    approval of <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>’s drafting role and direct him
                    to write the omitted sections.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">RECOMMENDATION</p>
                <p>That you authorize <persName corresp="#p_PR_2">Richard Pipes</persName> to secure

                    <item>Enforcement of U.S. Sanctions Against the Soviet Union</item>
                </list>
                <p>On August 26 the Commerce Department, on the President’s direction and in
                    response to the shipment to the Soviet Union of compressors covered by our
                    sanctions, issued a temporary denial order barring the <pb n="680" facs="0711" xml:id="pg_680"/>firms Dresser France and Creusot-Loire from access to U.S.
                    technology, materials or equipment. Should other companies in the near future
                    ship to the Soviet Union oil and gas equipment which has been denied by U.S.
                    sanctions issued on June 18, the United States will be taking further actions to
                    enforce the President’s policy.</p>
                <p>There has been considerable press speculation, both in the U.S. and abroad, about
                    the Commerce Department actions and the policy on which they are based. The
                    effect has been to call into question the consistency and steadfastness of U.S.
                    policy. In coming weeks, in discussions with the press and with representatives
                    of foreign governments, the President wishes to reaffirm that it is absolutely
                    imperative that all U.S. officials convey the same message:</p>
                <p>—U.S. sanctions of December 29, 1981, and their extension on June 18, 1982, and
                    the imposition of enforcement penalties on August 26, are a consistent and
                    measured response to Soviet actions in Poland. U.S. policy is fully consistent
                    with Western policy announced by the January 11 North Atlantic Council
                    communique.</p>
                <p>—The U.S. is prepared to moderate its sanctions against the Soviet Union if
                    significant progress is made in Poland on the three conditions specified by the
                    January 11 communique: lifting martial law, releasing those detained, and
                    resuming the dialogue among the government, Solidarity and the Church.</p>
                <p>—Meanwhile, the U.S. intends to implement the sanctions consistently and fairly
                    and continues to hope that the allies will cooperate to the best of their
                    ability.</p>
                <p>—The U.S. regrets that the sanctions on the Soviet Union will cause some economic
                    hardship to its allies, as they have and will to the U.S. We are willing to
                    consult on proposals by the allies for actions which would advance Western
                    objectives for Poland while minimizing the economic penalty to the West.</p>
                <p>—The President fully understands the allied governments’ objections to U.S.
                    policies. He has not found them persuasive enough to change U.S. policies, and
                    is by no means looking for an excuse to withdraw U.S. sanctions or
                    penalties.</p>
                <p>I also attach my memorandum of August 2,<note n="2" xml:id="d208fn2">Attached but

               </p>
                <p>By far the largest portion of these conversations were one-on-one plus
                    interpreters. While there are advantages to this arrangement, there are also
                    disadvantages which you should consider before the format is set for your first
                    round with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> at the upcoming <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>. (Incidentally, you will be the ninth US
                    Secretary of State with whom <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> has
                    dealt in his 25 years as Soviet Foreign Minister.)</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editing of the Record</p>
                <p>We also have <hi rend="italic">unedited</hi> versions of these conversations, and
                    you should be aware of the differences. First, the raw versions contain numerous
                    minor flaws in grammar and syntax (not surprisingly!) <pb n="682" facs="0713" xml:id="pg_682"/>which we fixed in the final versions. Secondly, the
                    conversations sometimes drifted into trivial or contentious by-play which did
                    not add anything to the substance of the exchange and which could be condensed
                    without loss of meaning. For example, in the January meeting there was an
                    extended exchange on details of alleged Soviet involvement with <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>, including weapons and advisers, and on
                    alleged US involvement with <persName corresp="#p_SJM_1">Savimbi</persName> and
                    South Africa. This exchange was singularly uninformative and acerbic and parts
                    of it were dropped. Similarly, some parts of <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s litany on US attitudes toward Cuba and Nicaragua and
                    of our replies, which were uninformative and repetitive were condensed.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, a few passages were edited out because of the sensitivity of the subject
                    matter, or the manner in which issues were addressed. For example, cuts were
                    made in several references to <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>,
                    Nixon, the “detente” period of the early 70s, and earlier arms control
                    “understandings” (although as you will see, a great amount of time in all three
                    sets of talks was spent on arms control). A portion of one talk, where <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> referred to “spheres of influence” in a
                    manner which implied understanding for Soviet concerns about Poland and
                    Afghanistan, was modified to refer to “sensitive areas,” not “spheres.” Along
                    the same line, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> expressed a bit too
                    much understanding for Soviet “restraint” in Poland on one occasion. And in one
                    of the discussions of Afghanistan, he assured <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that we would take steps to reduce or eliminate “outside
                    interference” from Pakistan as part of a larger settlement. In that connection,
                    by the way, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> went considerably farther than either
                    side did in the recent “experts” talks in Moscow, as even the edited record
                    shows.</p>
                <p>On China, which <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> raised each time
                    with warnings about the dangers of US–<gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                    military cooperation, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> assured him
                    (probably more than necessary) that we would not act in a way which threatened
                    Soviet interests and that there was not much going on with the Chinese anyway.
                    He also slightly misstated the results of Harold Brown’s 1980 China trip.
                        <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s reassurances and reference to
                    Brown were cut.</p>
                <p>Finally, on human rights cases, <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>
                    frankly was not much interested and his presentations showed it. He did not
                    press and he was too willing to accept the grounds for <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s rebuffs. The record was altered to
                    imply a tougher posture.</p>
                <p>In the context of the discussions, none of these issues (except perhaps human
                    rights) was more than a tactical or verbal ploy to keep the conversation aimed
                    toward the objectives <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> was trying to
                    reach. <pb n="683" facs="0714" xml:id="pg_683"/>But the context could easily
                    have been distorted and the words used to <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s disadvantage. The sum total of the revisions and
                    deletions amounts to perhaps 2% of the many pages of record. The record is not
                    verbatim in any case, but is reconstructed by the interpreters from their notes.
                    It is very long and detailed, as you will see, and it conveys an accurate
                    picture of what was said and how each issue was covered by both sides.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Analysis</p>
                <p>Each set of talks followed a similar pattern: broad principles, arms control (in
                    general and in detail), geopolitical issues (Poland, Afghanistan, Southern
                    Africa, Cuba, China, Kampuchea, Middle East), and bilateral irritants. The tone
                    varied from occasional humor and even cordiality to business-like problem
                    solving to strong statements of differing positions to occasional wrangling.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> is truly a master of his craft. He
                    can be earnest, articulate and highly persuasive. He knows his brief inside out
                    and almost never refers to notes. He can also be relentless and even rude,
                    especially if he feels that his counterpart is on the defensive. He covers a
                    weak case (e.g., on Afghanistan, or Cuban troops in Africa, or Soviet INF
                    deployments) by trying to shift the focus of the argument (e.g. to Pakistan, or
                    the US boycott of Cuba, or US/NATO weapons plans). He can be polemical, but not
                    in an ideological sense. He argues that US policies are consciously designed to
                    damage Soviet interests (e.g., increased defense spending, cooperation with
                    China) and that the US unfairly charges that Moscow is responsible for every
                    unpleasant development in the world. He claims, in contrast, that Soviet
                    policies are not intended to hurt the US or its real interest, but that we hurt
                    ourselves and blame them. He argues that better US-Soviet relations—even
                    cooperation—would serve the interests of both sides, but without promising
                    concrete steps which Moscow would be prepared to take to help it happen. The
                    best (or worst) example of <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                    negotiating style is the short meeting of September 28, 1981 (in which I
                    participated) where we spent one whole hour haggling over a short joint
                    statement announcing the beginning of the INF talks in Geneva in November,
                    1981.</p>
                <p>A suggestion on preparations: if you read these conversations in sequence, you
                    will see that <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> was much better in
                    the third set than in the first. You could shorten that learning curve somewhat
                    by meeting with him and getting his advice/comments/suggestions sometime between
                    now and the end of this month. You could do the same with <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, but his direct experience with
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> is less fresh. And you should
                    definitely schedule a dry-run several days ahead of time <pb n="684" facs="0715" xml:id="pg_684"/>with a few of us to try to anticipate both the content and
                    the style of <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s presentation.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Secretary</hi> welcomed Ambassador Ford, thanking him for
                    coming. He had glanced through Ambassador Ford’s paper with interest.<note n="2" xml:id="d210fn2">Not found.</note> His education on the Soviet Union was
                    continuing. Following the recent seminar he had held on the topic,<note n="3" xml:id="d210fn3">See <ref target="#d205">Documents 205</ref> and <ref target="#d206">206</ref>.</note>
                    <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Hal Sonnenfeldt</persName> has suggested Ambassador
                    Ford as the most knowledgeable man in the world on the Soviet Union, and he had
                    been in touch through Ambassador Gotlieb. <pb n="685" facs="0716" xml:id="pg_685"/>He would welcome Ambassador Ford’s comments, and then
                    perhaps the discussion could roam over Soviet behavior and prospects, U.S.
                    behavior and policies, and how they might relate.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said he would not spend much time on Soviet internal
                    matters. Everyone knows what Soviet internal difficulties are. It is hard to
                    separate domestic and international aspects in the Soviet case. He was
                    pessimistic that the Soviets can resolve their internal problems. He saw three
                    basic option mixes for trying:</p>
                <p>—1. Return to detente, an effort to improve the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s international position and acquire capital from the West,
                    some economic reform, and arms control. <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said he
                    thought economic reform impossible to implement, since it would threaten to
                    unravel the whole system. It was clear to him that one of the main reasons the
                    Soviets had intervened in Czechoslovakia in 1968 was apprehension over the
                    political implications of economic reform. From their point of view he thought
                    they were perfectly right. The small bosses around the country would support the
                    status quo. Poland made this option even harder. It could also include serious
                    arms control designed to reduce the proportion of <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> going to military expenditures. Ford thought all these elements
                    would be resisted by the military, the hardliners and the little bosses in the
                    system.</p>
                <p>—2. Immobilism. This had been the <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                    solution over the past few years. The Soviets are cautious and would prefer to
                    continue. This involves no basic concessions to the West, but also not-too-bad
                    relations with the West, i.e., doing little.</p>
                <p>—3. Stiffening. Here the Soviets would say to hell with it, claiming the West is
                    determined to weaken them, and give even more support to the military as the
                    only way to respond.</p>
                <p>Even if there were support for the first option, <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi>
                    thought, there would still be the almost insuperable obstacles of Poland and
                    Afghanistan. Even if the West says it is possible to improve relations, say in
                    arms control, if Poland and Afghanistan are unresolved it will be hard.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> asked if Ford considered arms control a
                    means of improving relations.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said it was important both in terms of domestic costs
                    to the Soviets and, of course, in East-West terms.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> said this suggested the idea, which he did
                    not endorse, that the best strategy was to have no arms control as the best
                    means of forcing the pace, since it would pressure them more than anything
                    else.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> replied that he thought economic pressure, especially
                    if it were coordinated Allied pressure, was probably the best, or even only, way
                    to change the Soviet system. The trouble is that it takes a long time to work.
                    In the short run the Soviets will resort to belt-tightening <pb n="686" facs="0717" xml:id="pg_686"/>and more stress on the military, and they can
                    do it. We are in for a tricky 5–6 years until the West achieves parity or
                    superiority, and in the meantime they can be expected to tighten up. <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> did not believe they would resort to war, since this
                    would risk their privileges, but they would be more willing to take risks. After
                    5–6 years, he was convinced, what the Soviets call the “correlation of forces”
                    would be shifting very strongly in our favor. Until then, however, the situation
                    will be dangerous.</p>
                <p>Asked what our policy approach should be over the next 5–10 years, <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said that in the short run we cannot alter the
                    regime. It will change from within if at all, as in the past. International
                    problems will be dangerous, and the Soviets will have a tendency to rely on
                    their military strength to deal with them; Poland and Afghanistan will remain
                    problems. <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said he could imagine a strong leader
                    wishing to indicate something to the West on Afghanistan, but not on Poland.
                    Poland in his view would be the most serious obstacle to improvement in
                    relations with the West.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> asked if this meant Ford saw no way for the
                    Poles to get out of their box.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said he did not. By this he meant he saw no solution
                    that could please the Russians. The Poles could not reinstate a party that could
                    both rule the country and be loyal to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and for the Russians there is no other solution. For them junta
                    rule must be a terrible example for other parties. Economic reform is also
                    something the Soviet Union finds it hard to permit; finally there is the concern
                    for security and order. Minor cosmetic changes may be possible, but it is hard
                    to see more than that without the Russians objecting. <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> thought it likely that they would eventually have to intervene
                    militarily.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>
                  </hi> said
                    military intervention remains a real possibility, but for the moment the Soviets
                    seem relatively satisfied with the Polish military in power. At the moment they
                    do not appear to be overly worried. Over the long run, of course, what Ford said
                    was true.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said the policy objective should thus be to reduce
                    the dangers of the next years. First, we should give greater recognition to the
                    fact that the Soviets see themselves as beleaguered and think we see them the
                    same way, and are trying to destroy their regime. This is not to say we should
                    not correct the military situation; on the contrary, the West surely needs to
                    correct its military posture and achieve parity or in some areas superiority.
                    But isn’t there something we can do to give the Soviets the feeling we recognize
                    their fears? They are touchy and obsessed by this issue, want to be considered
                    as on the same level with us; they are terribly sensitive to slights to their
                    great power status.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> asked for example of slights and of what
                    Ford would consider proper recognition.</p>
                <pb n="687" facs="0718" xml:id="pg_687"/>
                <p>As slights, <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> mentioned the failure to ratify <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, which they interpreted as a slight;
                        “<persName corresp="#p_JH_1">Jackson</persName>-Pollock” (sic); <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>’s letter to <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName>, which was tremendously insulting to them; and, “with
                    respect,” elements in President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s
                    speeches which touched raw nerves. We are dealing with a paradox, since they say
                    they are convinced their own system will win and ours will be destroyed, but do
                    not believe their own ideology.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said he thought it very important to reestablish an
                    element of crisis control. There had been some work done under the Nixon
                    Administration which could be built on. This would be of benefit to both sides;
                    he saw it as purely preventive. It would also help the U.S. with its Allies, who
                    continue to look to the U.S. lead.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> asked if this meant giving them a sense that
                    there is a pattern of communication between us and the Soviets. <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said yes, in the sense of dealing with crises,
                    preventing them from getting out of hand.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>
                  </hi> asked
                    what Ford meant by work formerly done that could be built on. <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said he thought we had made a good start in this area under
                    Nixon.</p>
                <p>Another element useful for “proper recognition,” <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi>
                    said, was arms control. In discussion these issues with his Prime Minister, they
                    did not always agree, but he had to say that he did agree with the Prime
                    Minister that there should not be any linkage on arms talks.</p>
                <p>As a final element, <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said, after the succession we
                    should seize any opportunity that they are offering to back down on key issues.
                    There are examples of their wanting a pause; the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact is one.
                    Many Russians feel they have been pushing their people as hard as possible, and
                    that in renewed military competition with the West they will need to pay too
                    much to keep the parity they have achieved. The West should respond if the
                    opportunity of a Soviet backdown arises.</p>

                  </hi> asked how
                    East-West trade fitted in this.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said he personally did not see much of a future in
                    East-West trade. It was of course important for some factories and for the
                    employment it provides. Probably the U.S. and Canada got the most advantage from
                    it among Western countries, since they sell grain. But it is not overall a very
                    key element.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> asked what Ford had meant at the end of his
                    paper when he spoke of the Soviets playing “their only really valid card.” <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said he had meant deriving political benefits from
                    the military force they have built up.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_BRD_1">Blackwill</persName>
                  </hi> asked
                    how Ford saw the Soviets exploiting differences among the Western Allies. <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> replied that the Soviets of course always <pb n="688" facs="0719" xml:id="pg_688"/>seek to divide the Allies. Right now
                    they may see some hope of success in the internal situations in France, Germany
                    and the Netherlands. It was his personal feeling that the pipeline decision was
                    all wrong, although once it was signed it was necessary to go through with it.
                    On the other hand, the Europeans should also do more, and would certainly look
                    silly if the pipeline were finished and they then saw the Soviets invade Poland.
                    European resistance to the pipeline is not unanimous; the French, for instance,
                    feel very strongly about Poland, and this is particularly true of the trade
                    unions. Europe should make more of an effort. What is needed are agreed
                    guidelines on future economic cooperation with the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> said we too would like nothing better, if
                    only the Europeans would agree. <hi rend="italic">Ambassador Gotlieb</hi> said
                    he too hoped we can find diplomatic common ground on this topic; it is the only
                    way to go.</p>

                  </hi> asked if
                    Ford saw pressures from the Soviets in this matter. <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi>
                    replied that he suspected the Soviets would continue to try to separate the
                    Allies but realized that all such quarrels, like the De Gaulle episode, are
                    temporary and will be overcome in time.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_WPD_1">Wolfowitz</persName>
                  </hi>
                    commented that neither side had up to now saved much money by arms control
                    agreements, and it was hard to see arms control agreements coming up that would
                    save money if concluded. If the pressures on Soviet military spending were as
                    strong as Ford appeared to believe, one place where real savings might be
                    possible was in Soviet relations with China. Here there was a huge buildup, very
                    costly in addition to being psychologically important. They might try a
                    latter-day 1939 in this area.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said he doubted cost was the main factor in the
                    Soviet approach to China. They will not in any case demobilize. Conventional
                    force costs are smaller for them than for us. He thought a pact with China or
                    even a big improvement in relations unlikely. Even if there were some kind of
                    agreement the Soviets would still need a large standing army, and there was the
                    added psychological importance for the Soviets of maintaining a visible Soviet
                    presence in the Far East.</p>
                <p>With regard to costs, <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said, it is perfectly true that
                    the Soviets have up to now done what they felt they needed to do. But we are now
                    entering a new era in arms development which is likely to be extremely
                    expensive. It will require inputs from a civilian economy that is already
                    beggared, especially in trained personnel. The savings possible are perhaps not
                    great, but it is the aim of some Russians to reduce a little bit. If they do not
                    they are bound to weaken the civilian economy even further.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> asked why the economic situation is bound to
                    get worse.</p>
                <pb n="689" facs="0720" xml:id="pg_689"/>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said it is because the situation is so bad now and
                    because against that background more capital will be needed to prevent the
                    civilian sector slipping disastrously.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_DKW_1">Dam</persName>
                  </hi> said it was
                    not clear to him why Soviet military expenditures kept going up whatever the
                    political context. Perhaps they went up through immobilism rather than in
                    response to international events.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said this was true, and it will be hard to cut the
                    military budget in the best of circumstances. As he saw it, the <gloss target="#t_RD_1">R&amp;D</gloss> for the SS–20 had been done in 1968 and
                    1969, during the worst of the Vietnam War, and the military had probably
                    convinced the civilians that it was needed because the U.S. was growing more
                    menacing. By the time detente came along in 1972–73, however, it was already in
                    production. At that point the military had probably argued the Soviets had to
                    use what they had in hand. This was just a hypothesis, but it was plausible to
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName>
                  </hi> asked
                    Ford to relate this momentum factor to succession prospects, to possible shifts
                    in the Soviet mindset and how we might affect them. He asked what we should be
                    particularly careful about.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said he thought we should give the Soviets the
                    respect they feel they are entitled to, and respond to opportunities if they
                    appear. We will lack the information to go further than that: in the Stalin
                    succession Khrushchev at first looked like the most sycophantic Stalinist
                    around. He felt there was no question that the leadership after <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> would devolve onto a troika and even
                    greater diffusion of power. The situation was likely to resemble the
                    post-Khrushchev period, when <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had
                    taken six years to make his imprint on the bureaucracy. He had survived since
                    because he had nourished the feeling of identification with him on domestic and
                    foreign policy grounds down through the Central Committee level. It was hard to
                    believe that a new leader would have the character or strength to impose himself
                    as a new ruler. He would have come up through the <hi rend="italic">aparat</hi>,
                    in the hard school of bureaucratic politics, and the <hi rend="italic">aparat</hi> wants to hold on to what it has got, and sees no reason to
                    change.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> commented that this seems to be a
                    comfortable or good approach for members of the leadership, but a bad situation
                    from the general standpoint. We asked whether this distinction will not affect
                    prospects.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> replied that the primary objective of all Soviet
                    leaders is to keep the Communist Party in power. They only changed if this
                    objective is threatened by pressures from the economy or international
                    pressures, if they otherwise face a blank wall.</p>

                     <persName corresp="#p_SWJ_1">Stoessel</persName>
                  </hi> asked
                    about the theory that the technocrats will gain more influence as economic
                    problems come to the fore. As the party becomes <pb n="690" facs="0721" xml:id="pg_690"/>more despised for ineptitude, the power of technicians
                    might grow, with the younger generation shifting toward them.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said the problem was that the technicians are also
                    Party members, and their privileges come from what the Party has given them.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ambassador Gotlieb</hi> asked if he were right to say Ford was
                    recommending “attentism”—a kind of intellectual holding concept—for the short
                    term, and an attempt to reduce the dangers of confrontation for the medium
                    term.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> replied that he did not consider a return to detente
                    to be a serious option. He thought it would be a mistake to make offers of
                    improvement before we can say that our rearmament effort is working. But we
                    should by all means be cautious.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_BRD_1">Blackwill</persName>
                  </hi> asked
                    how we are to understand the Soviet Union’s geopolitical activism in the 1970’s
                    if it is true that the Soviets lack historical confidence in their future.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ford</hi> said one of the mistakes of detente was to exclude
                    the Soviet commitment to support national-liberation movements from
                    consideration. It has always been there, and was needed to prove the regime’s
                        <hi rend="italic">bona fides</hi>. It was one way to allow the Soviets to
                    give foreign affairs support to almost any movement. It will continue. After a
                    long period of hesitation, the Soviets did more in this area during the 1970’s
                    because the opportunities were there. They saw no contradiction with detente,
                    and they were also feeling their oats, experimenting with use of the military
                    power they had acquired to achieve parity with the U.S. It was also the peak
                    period of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> as a world leader.</p>
                <p>Speaking for Canada, <hi rend="italic">Ambassador Gotlieb</hi> said the GOC
                    focusses on a stabilizing environment for the future. It agrees it is sensible
                    to have two legs in one’s approach: rebuilding Western strength and “attentism.”
                    The third possible leg is a long-term conception in U.S. policy that the wave of
                    history is with us and the Soviet system won’t work. The resulting prescription
                    is to mobilize all elements favoring this wave of history. To be successful,
                    this would require a major consensus to use economic instruments. He thought
                    that consensus was probably “not there.” Trying to achieve it would have high
                    costs in West-West relations, which would benefit the Soviets greatly. It is
                    sensible to seek it on small things—technology transfer, credits—but one cannot
                    proceed too far down this road without losing the consensus necessary to make
                    the approach work.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> commented that it is one thing to seek the
                    Soviet Union’s demise and another to seek to limit Soviet options, confining
                    them to their own resources.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> thanked Ambassador Ford for sharing his
                    wisdom, invited him to get in touch when he was visiting Washington, and asked
                    him not to be surprised if the Secretary called upon his counsel again.</p>

               </p>
                <p>The Soviet proposal is not, in my opinion, warmed-over <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, as our chief negotiator suggests. Rather, it is roughly
                    what might have been expected from them in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> III, had <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II been
                    ratified—an offer of significant, but not deep, reductions linked to
                    restrictions on US forces of chief concern to Moscow, cruise and theater (INF)
                    missiles. The Administration’s approach has thus produced dividends:</p>
                <p>—By convincing the Soviets that we’re committed to US nuclear force
                    modernization, we’ve induced them to offer more than they’ve offered before in
                    order to restrain our programs.</p>
                <p>—By adopting a politically appealing deep reductions proposal, we’ve caused them
                    to follow suit, albeit in lesser measure, in order to deny us sole possession of
                    the high ground.</p>
                <p>—By saying, in effect, we’ll respect <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II
                    limits, we’ve convinced them to move on to more ambitious arms control instead
                    of concentrating on bringing <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II formally
                    into force.</p>
                <p>The main differences between us and the Soviets concern: (1) the level of
                    reductions; and (2) the fact that the Soviets do not share our interest in
                    concentrating reductions in ballistic weapons. They haven’t accepted our view
                    that <hi rend="italic">fast</hi> (i.e., ballistic) weapons are more
                    destabilizing than <hi rend="italic">slow</hi> (i.e., bomber and cruise)
                    weapons. Moreover, concentrating on ballistic weapons would require major
                    changes in their ballistic-<pb n="692" facs="0723" xml:id="pg_692"/>oriented
                    force posture while leaving us free to produce in great numbers the weapons
                    about which they are most concerned: cruise missiles.</p>
                <p>To be sure, there are other obstacles: whether or not the Soviet Backfire bomber
                    should be counted as a strategic delivery vehicle; whether and how to limit
                    non-deployed missiles; and whether the Soviets will accept intrusive
                    verification measures. But these should prove manageable if a deal could be
                    struck on the central issues of how far and what to reduce. (I address below the
                    Soviet demand that a <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> agreement be
                    accompanied by abandonment of our INF deployment program.) All in all, it is not
                    unrealistic to contemplate a <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> agreement
                    within the next two years, provided both sides make a determined effort.</p>
                <p>I happen to believe that a <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> agreement
                    somewhere between the current US and Soviet positions would be very much in our
                    strategic interest, not to mention a major success for the President and proof
                    that our approach to nuclear arms control and dealing with Moscow has been
                    correct. I’m convinced that there will be no agreement if we do not go a
                    reasonable distance to meet Soviet concerns about cruise missiles, especially
                    the air- and sea-launched versions, where our growth potential is greatest, and
                    that the pay-off of cutting the Soviet ballistic force would more than justify
                    placing our cruise programs under limits.</p>
                <p>Others will argue that an agreement is in our interest only if it is based on our
                    opening position. They claim that the survivability of our land-based missiles
                    would not be enhanced by a <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> agreement
                    permitting the Soviets significantly more land-based missiles than our proposal
                    would allow. They point out that our air- and sea-launched cruise missiles are
                    strictly retaliatory forces and that constraining them would therefore weaken
                    deterrence. Finally, some will argue that a <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> agreement is almost certain to undercut popular support for
                    sustained growth in defense spending, so we’d better insist on an agreement that
                    cuts Soviet forces drastically. While I’m not persuaded by these arguments, they
                    are serious and deserve your consideration.</p>
                <p>The question of whether to make a serious effort to get an agreement should also
                    be viewed in the context of what relationship we want with Moscow. The Soviet
                    move suggests to me that Moscow still wants to do business with this
                    Administration. The Soviets will draw conclusions from how we handle <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> about whether we want to do business with
                    them in areas of potential common interest.</p>
                <p>If, in this succession period, the Soviets conclude that the Administration is
                    not interested in progress in what has always been treated as an area of strong
                    common interest, they will have to wonder whether there is any point in showing
                    moderation in other areas. Again, there are other ways to look at it. We have
                    said that progress in arms control <pb n="693" facs="0724" xml:id="pg_693"/>should be accompanied by progress toward settling international problems
                    caused by Soviet misdeeds. Some would argue—and I’m not altogether
                    unsympathetic—that a US effort to yield progress in <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> would lead the Soviets to conclude that all the talk about
                    linkage was just that: talk. My own view is that, even with tight linkage, we
                    won’t find it easy to use Soviet interest in restraining our nuclear programs as
                    a lever to alter Soviet international conduct—but what leverage we have will be
                    removed if the Soviets think we want arms control progress no matter how they
                    and their proxies behave.</p>
                <p>Assuming we want to go for an agreement—unless the Soviets embark on new foreign
                    adventures—timing can be crucial. On the one hand, if, say, a year passes from
                    the time the negotiations began (this past spring) and the US has not budged,
                    the Soviets are likely to dismiss the idea of an agreement with this
                    Administration. On the other hand, if we leap too quickly, the Soviets may
                    conclude that they can get an agreement closer to their current position than to
                    ours if they just stand pat. We might therefore think in terms of a substantive
                    move early next year, perhaps signalled in a January meeting between you and
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. This would leave a full year
                    for give-and-take before getting so close to the American election as to create
                    an appearance of using <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> for electoral
                    purposes.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">INF</p>
                <p>Differences between us and the Soviets in this negotiation are more profound. The
                    prospects for convergence are poor: we lack negotiating leverage (our missile
                    deployments don’t even start until late next year); our demand that the Soviets
                    dismantle their entire long-range missile force is not remotely realistic; and
                    we and the Soviets disagree sharply over whether to include aircraft (we say no,
                    they say yes), French and British forces (we say no, they say yes), and Soviet
                    forces opposite China (we say yes, they say no).</p>
                <p>Through two negotiating rounds, we haven’t budged. The Soviets have made cosmetic
                    changes and are likely to make substantive concessions in order to pin blame for
                    the lack of progress on us, induce the Allies to pressure us to soften our
                    position, and, most importantly, erode support for our missile deployment plan.
                    The Allies will want us to show that we are making every effort to get an
                    agreement before deployments begin, even if they realize that an agreement may
                    be unobtainable.</p>
                <p>In considering the possibility of changing our INF position, the most important
                    question is what impact it would have on Allied support for modernization. If
                    European publics perceive the sides to be far apart because of <hi rend="italic">US</hi> intransigence, they will be susceptible to the claim that we are
                    using the negotiations as a cover to permit the <pb n="694" facs="0725" xml:id="pg_694"/>deployments—then we’ll be in trouble. If they see the sides
                    far apart because of <hi rend="italic">Soviet</hi> intransigence, we can make
                    the argument that the deployments must begin before the Soviets will have
                    sufficient incentive to negotiate in earnest. At the same time, if we make a
                    move, we could create a sense of progress and put the Soviets in the position of
                    moving further themselves while warning that hopes for an agreement would
                    evaporate if deployments commence. It’s important to bear in mind that much of
                    the European support for deployments is based on the argument that the Soviets
                    would have no incentive to negotiate unless they were convinced that we will
                    proceed with deployments absent an agreement. Faced with new hope that success
                    in negotiations might make deployments unnecessary, combined with a fear that
                    commencing deployments might damage the negotiations, large segments of European
                    opinion might be drawn to the idea of delaying deployments “to give arms control
                    more time.” It’s hard to forecast how “Europe” will react to INF negotiating
                    developments. But it’s clear that managing these political dynamics will require
                    great skill and close consultations with key Allied leaders, especially the
                    German Chancellor.</p>
                <p>My own feeling is that we should be prepared to alter our INF position if and
                    when it becomes clear that failure to do so will jeopardize support for
                    modernization. That said, we should not stray from our insistence or equal
                    limits and significant reductions. Nor should we get drawn into a deal that
                    would allow both us and the Soviets to maintain INF missiles outside of Europe
                    while banning them in Europe; this would suggest a “decoupling” of the US from
                    Europe without eliminating the Soviet nuclear threat to Europe.</p>
                <p>Rather, we should consider such possibilities as offering limits on aircraft
                    (which the Joint Chiefs would oppose) and proposing equal missile limits greater
                    than zero (but well below current Soviet and planned US force levels). We might
                    also think about the possibility of offering limits on sea-launched cruise
                    missiles (<gloss target="#t_SLCM_1">SLCM</gloss>) as part of an INF agreement.
                    The Soviets will insist that these weapons be treated either in <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> or INF; if we put them in <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> the Allies will see us using the
                    negotiating leverage of our <gloss target="#t_SLCM_1">SLCM</gloss> program to
                    limit the threat to us instead of the threat to them. There are those who argue
                    that we shouldn’t put <gloss target="#t_SLCM_1">SLCM</gloss>’s on the
                    negotiating block at all—and, indeed, I would recommend considering a numerical
                    ceiling, not a ban.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">The <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>–INF Link</p>
                <p>The Soviets have said they will not go along with strategic reductions if we are
                    left free to build up forces that can strike the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> from Europe. While they may soften this stance, they will at
                    least want to have an INF agreement more or less in hand before accepting a
                        <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>
                    <pb n="695" facs="0726" xml:id="pg_695"/>agreement. For vastly different
                    reasons, the Allies will insist on the same link. We’d face a violent political
                    storm—especially in Germany—if it appeared that we were making a more serious
                    effort to reduce the nuclear threat to the US than to reduce the nuclear threat
                    to Western Europe.</p>
                <p>The link works in reverse as well. An INF agreement would be largely irrelevant
                    without a <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> agreement, since the Soviets
                    would be free to add “strategic” forces and target them on Europe instead of on
                    us. In practice, however, we’re unlikely to find it easier to reach an INF
                    agreement than a <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> agreement.</p>
                <p>There are a range of possibilities for linking <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> and INF: separate negotiations leading to separate agreements
                    at separate times; separate negotiations leading to separate agreements at
                    roughly the same time; separate negotiations leading to a single agreement with
                    separate limits on strategic and INF systems; merged negotiations leading to a
                    single agreement with integrated limits on strategic and INF systems. It’s too
                    early to say which approach is best. One option we don’t have is going for a
                        <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> agreement without at least being
                    prepared to try for movement in INF. Ultimately, we may face the dilemma of what
                    to do if we and the Soviets are ready to settle on strategic limits but are
                    still far apart on INF limits. For now, we’d be wise to accompany any move in
                        <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> with an equally significant move in
                    INF, lest we trigger a German anxiety attack.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">“Freeze” Politics</p>
                <p>The Administration stayed ahead of the freeze movement this past spring by
                    beginning <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> and making the argument that
                    a freeze would remove the Soviets’ incentive to agree to strategic reductions.
                    Of course, posing the issue as a choice between a freeze and reductions only
                    works if reductions are believed to be achievable. It won’t be long before the
                    critics start asking (rhetorically) where the progress is. If the Administration
                    responds that we are making progress, it will be admitting that the Soviets have
                    made an important proposal, in which case pressures will increase to alter our
                    own <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> position. If the Administration
                    wants to avoid giving the Soviets credit for their move, it will have to claim
                    there has been little progress, in which case interest in a freeze will grow.
                    One advantage of a US move in <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> is that
                    it permits us to cite progress without crediting the Soviets and adding to the
                    pressure on ourselves. That said, I for one would not favor a move until early
                    next year.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Interagency Problem</p>
                <p>I haven’t tried to convince you to follow a particular course; you’ll want to get
                    others’ views and do some thinking of your own. But I hope I have convinced you
                    that success—however defined—will <pb n="696" facs="0727" xml:id="pg_696"/>require agility. Unfortunately, the existing interagency process relies on
                    bottom-up thinking and is plagued by philosophical differences so severe that
                    those who have good ideas that might produce progress are afraid to float them.
                    Unless the process is made more responsive, those opposed to movement will
                    prevail by default. At a minimum, the initiative in these negotiations will
                    shift to the Soviets, and we’ll find it hard to manage the politics of INF in
                    Europe and the politics of the “freeze” at home.</p>
                <p>Altering interagency procedures—e.g., setting up a new group chaired by <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staff—won’t solve the basic problem. What is
                    needed is for everyone to have a clearer sense of where the President wants to
                    see these negotiations go. If he wants progress, he will need to make known that
                    he wants to consider options that would produce progress. If he wants to sit
                    tight, we shouldn’t worry that the system is unresponsive. My hunch is that he
                    would at least want to consider what might be done to get movement. The way to
                    find out is not by asking him to react piece-meal to specific negotiating issues
                    that cannot be settled in the bureaucratic trenches, but rather by offering him
                    your broad ideas directly and getting a reaction.</p>

                <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Regan</persName> opened the meeting. He
                    stated that the objective of the meeting was to agree on a package of sanctions
                    which the U.S. Government would be willing to exchange for the sanctions
                    currently in place against the Soviet Union in response to the events in Poland.
                    He also stated that the problem of including Japan in any agreement should be
                    addressed. The meeting was then turned over to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>.</p>
                <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> stated that we need to
                    review our overall objectives toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                    and establish where we are now. He referred to the President’s four point
                    decision in response to his memorandum of <pb n="698" facs="0729" xml:id="pg_698"/>August 24. He noted that the final point of that set of
                    decisions was a charge to prepare the U.S. position for the time that the
                    European allies proposed discussions on the sanctions issue. He then briefly
                    reviewed the history and status of the arrangements for talks with the European
                    allies affected by the extraterritorial application of the sanctions. Originally
                    the British had proposed talks on the issues and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> had accepted the proposal. After
                    negotiations among the European countries themselves and a British request that
                    the U.S. call a meeting, which the Secretary refused, the plans for a meeting
                    had been suspended. The Secretary said that there would be the opportunity to
                    discuss these issues during the bilateral meetings on the margins of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly, but a definite meeting had not
                    been scheduled. <hi rend="italic">He stated that in this setting it did not seem
                        wise to work out a detailed negotiating package or set of guidelines since
                        any meeting would simply be used to feel the Europeans out.</hi>
               </p>
                <p>The Secretary then proceeded to outline his understanding of the President’s
                    policy on East-West trade. First, the President was realistic about the behavior
                    of the Soviet Union—military buildup, the use of chemical weapons, Central
                    America, Horn of Africa, Kampuchea, the invasion of Afghanistan and, finally,
                    the suppression in Poland were both objectionable in themselves and examples of
                    underlying Soviet behavior. To deal with the Soviets, the U.S. needed
                    strength—military strength, based on an adequate military budget—and the
                    capacity to use it if necessary. By the same token, the U.S. needed economic
                    strength and the capacity to bring it to bear. The President was willing to
                    negotiate with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in areas of mutual
                    advantage, for example in arms reductions, and in economic areas such as the
                    sale of grain. However, in all negotiations, it was necessary to negotiate from
                    strength and the U.S. objective was to limit Soviet options—military, economic
                    and ideological. Once the Soviets understood that their options were limited,
                    they would have the incentive to change their behavior. If this occurred, the
                    U.S. would be willing to discuss a constructive relationship.</p>
                <p>Thus, although the primary dimension of U.S. strength in dealing with the Soviet
                    Union is military, it is in a political setting. This means that the political
                    dimension of alliances such as <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> is
                    important, and the “whole thing relates together.” The problem is that many
                    European countries do not have the “stand in there” attitude of the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> administration.</p>
                <p>The economic dimension of national strength is an adjunct to military strength.
                    The Secretary then proceeded to summarize a paper on East-West trade which he
                    had written before assuming his current <pb n="699" facs="0730" xml:id="pg_699"/>office.<note n="2" xml:id="d212fn2">Reference is to a paper <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> wrote on March 17, on the subject
                        of trade and diplomacy in U.S.-Soviet relations. <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> forwarded copies to <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WWA_1">Wallis</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Buckley</persName>
                        under cover of a separate August 24 note, and to <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> under cover of an August 25
                        note. (Department of State, Executive Secretariat, <gloss target="#t_SSI_1">S/S–I</gloss> Records, The Executive Secretariat’s Special Caption
                        Documents, Lot 92D630, “Not for System—August 1982”)</note> Trade is by its
                    nature mutually advantageous, although not equally advantageous. Because of its
                    ability to buy and sell as a single unit, the Soviet Union has been able to gain
                    advantages which are out of proportion to its overall economic strength compared
                    to the West. A good example has been grain sales, and it is for this reason that
                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> has favored long-term
                    agreements in this area. Furthermore, trade involves the transfer of “ideas,”
                    and in East-West trade, the ideas flow (with the exception of grain) from West
                    to East. Despite its economic superiority, the West today finds that trade has
                    given advantages to the East: the U.S. farmers are dependent on Soviet markets,
                    and Western bankers find themselves dependent on their East European debtors.
                    The long-term challenge is to alter these relationships, so that the advantages
                    of East-West trade swing to the West.</p>
                <p>By definition, any trade with the Soviet Union gives some advantage to the Soviet
                    Union, and thereby increases Soviet military capability. However, this
                    administration has not adopted a “no trade” policy. The allies are firmly in
                    favor of East-West trade. The question is to set the limits on this trade, to
                    question individual transactions as to whether substitutes are available,
                    whether there are military applications of the items traded, and to evaluate
                    each transaction. A second set of criteria to apply to limiting trade with the
                        <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is whether it can be used for
                    “tactical maneuver” in putting pressure on the behavior of the Soviet Union. In
                    general, the Secretary believed, short-term trade measures have little effect on
                    Soviet behavior. Policies needed to be sustained to have effect. The current
                    sanctions, for example, the Secretary believes, should be maintained or, if
                    replaced, replaced with sustainable measures. A third consideration is
                    cooperation with allies. Almost any trade measure in East-West trade is more
                    effective if implemented by all the Western countries.</p>
                <p>As the officer charged by the President with preparing for talks with the
                    Europeans on possible replacement measures for the current sanctions, Secretary
                        <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> was looking for a set of
                    measures that would have clarity, would affect the Soviet Union, could be
                    sustained, and would have broad Western support. There had been a number of
                    suggestions within the <gloss target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss>, several of which
                    had already been discussed with the allies. Now the United States had shown a
                    depth of determination which had not been clear earlier, and it might be better
                    able to reach agreement with the allies. The Secretary noted that, con<pb n="700" facs="0731" xml:id="pg_700"/>trary to certain press reports, the
                    U.S. Government was not looking for a way to drop the sanctions. If an
                    acceptable alternative package could not be worked out, we would “stick with
                    what we have.”</p>
                <p>The Secretary then reviewed the elements which could be included in an
                    alternative sanctions package. The first was credit, which the Secretary
                    considered “our best tool.” It was difficult for any government to argue that it
                    made sense to give the Soviet Union subsidized credit. Some progress had been
                    made with the allies before Versailles. The remaining work was to gain agreement
                    or down payments and set up a monitoring body. This was essential because of the
                    possibilities of manipulation of the price of equipment and credit terms, i.e.
                    hidden subsidies.</p>
                <p>The second area was affirming and expanding <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>. Like credits, <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> was
                    an area in which it was relatively easy to gain agreement in principle, but
                    difficult to agree on specific implementing measures.</p>
                <p>The third area was sanctions on the export of oil and gas technology. In this
                    area, it would be difficult to secure allied agreement, even though the United
                    States was the dominant supplier. <hi rend="italic">It might be necessary to
                        “play hardball” with the European countries, refusing them this technology
                        for non-Soviet sales if they did not go along with embargoing sales to the
                        Soviet Union. With carefully</hi> chosen items, this area might be suitable
                    for an agreement.</p>
                <p>The fourth area was alternative energy sources. This area was also “susceptible”
                    to agreement in principle, but difficult in implementation. Algeria, for
                    example, had proved itself an unreliable supplier. However, the Secretary felt
                    that the Norwegian/Dutch arrangements might be worked out, and this alternative
                    source brought on line before the 1990s. Another problem was Soviet pricing
                    policies, which would undercut Norwegian and Dutch prices.</p>
                <p>The Europeans would place grain sales on the agenda. The U.S. must maintain the
                    position of no subsidies for grain sales, and keep these sales as an example of
                    why we should not adopt a “no trade” position.</p>
                <p>Concluding his summary, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>
                    noted that in the various agency papers there were detailed discussions in each
                    of these areas. <hi rend="italic">He reiterated his belief that it did not make
                        sense to formulate a detailed U.S. position. For example, in discussions it
                        might turn out that the Europeans were willing to offer more attractive
                        propositions. However, it was important to maintain the principle that any
                        alternative set of sanctions must be at least as effective in punishing the
                        Soviet Union as the current sanctions, and must be more broadly supported,
                        to include Europe and Japan.</hi> In the meantime, we should not
                    underestimate the power or the temporary denial orders of the Commerce
                    Department. They are wreaking a great deal of havoc, <pb n="701" facs="0732" xml:id="pg_701"/>both with European companies and with our own. They also
                    demonstrate the depth of our determination, which is valuable in any
                    negotiation. The President has made his preference clear, and it is up to his
                    “agents” to carry them out.</p>
                <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> stated that the
                    President’s objective was to improve the situation in Poland by punishing the
                    Soviet Union using the tool of the pipeline sanctions. Any alternative measures
                    to be adopted should not set back those objectives, yet should assist in
                    limiting the damage to alliance relations. Germany promised to be a special
                    problem, since it is so strongly committed to trade with the Soviet Union.
                    Concerning credit restraint, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> had never been impressed by shortening maturity
                    dates. It was important to arrange credit restraints so that they restricted
                    hard currency available to the Soviet Union. In the area of alternative energy
                    sources, it was important to bring other sources on stream before the 1990s—the
                    MidEast and our own Alaskan fields were possibilities. France, for example, is
                    only importing Soviet gas as a backup fuel, and could be worked on in this area.
                        <hi rend="italic">The U.S. could ask for a limitation to the deliveries from
                        the first strand of the pipeline,</hi> as it should have three years ago.
                        <hi rend="italic">If there is to be a meeting between the United States and
                        the Europeans, there should be clear instructions to the U.S. side. If other
                        attractive possibilities arose, the instructions could be adjusted. However,
                        clear instructions were in many ways an advantage.</hi> The current U.S.
                    sanctions should not be underestimated in their effect, and should not be
                    exchanged for something else lightly.</p>
                <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName> stated that what was
                    needed was a fundamental policy on East-West trade, particularly in the oil and
                    gas area. This policy should be constructed independent of Poland. In addition,
                    in taking sanctions against the Soviet Union, it is important that the burdens
                    be shared within the alliance. It is important to win in this dispute, now that
                    it has been joined, and the U.S. position would be stronger if we were supported
                    by our allies.</p>
                <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName> went on to several
                    near-term decisions which needed to be made concerning our current policies:
                    First, the “unintended effects” of our temporary denial orders. Dresser France
                    supplies equipment to Brazil, Western oil companies in the North Sea, and even
                    Australia. Our orders are holding up supplies to these projects outside of the
                    Soviet Union. Second, “hardship” cases: a German subsidiary of the Cameron Iron
                    Works of Houston, Texas stands to lose a $100M contract signed in March 1982 of
                    low-technology oil and gas equipment to the Soviet Union. Third, “legal”
                    problems which involve closing loopholes in the denial orders. For example, the
                    thirteen subsidiaries of Creusot-Loire now have to be included in the temporary
                    denial order making this our “most shakey” legal case. The U.S. could sustain
                        <pb n="702" facs="0733" xml:id="pg_702"/>a reversal in this instance which
                    could hurt us. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName> stated
                    that a system was needed for reviewing the problems in these three categories.
                        <hi rend="italic">He pointed out that the primary objective of the current
                        policies were not to harm U.S. companies, and to do so risked losing U.S.
                        support for the policies. In this connection, he stated there should be a
                        way to make exceptions as we are doing ourselves damage.</hi>
               </p>
                <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CWJ_1">Casey</persName> stated that an
                    Intelligence Estimate was in final stages of preparation which would give in
                    some detail the military effects of East-West trade.<note n="3" xml:id="d212fn3">See <ref target="#d213">Document 213</ref>.</note> Director <persName corresp="#p_CWJ_1">Casey</persName> stated that he believed that the
                    restriction of the transfer of high technology to the Soviet Union was perhaps
                    the most important measure the West could take, followed by the restriction of
                    militarily relevant oil and gas technology, and finally, future pipelines to
                    Western Europe which generate substantial hard currency. In reply to a question
                    from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>, Director
                        <persName corresp="#p_CWJ_1">Casey</persName> said that he agreed with the
                    categories of measures against the Soviet Union which had been discussed, but
                    that we needed to look carefully at the priority of those categories based on
                    their effect on the Soviet Union, and to consider whether they could be
                    negotiated with the allies.</p>
                <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Regan</persName> then proposed four items
                    as a result of the meeting:</p>
                <p>—First, that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> hold
                    discussions with the allies as he had suggested, under only the broad
                    instructions that an alternative package should cause “equal pain to the Soviet
                    Union to what we are now inflicting.” At the completion of those talks, if there
                    had been no European offer, the <gloss target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss> would
                    reevaluate the situation.</p>
                <p>—Second, that the Secretary of Commerce would be authorized to make exceptions
                    for those features of the denial orders which were damaging U.S. companies, but
                    not the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>—Third, that the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> proceed quickly with the
                    Intelligence Estimate.</p>
                <p>—Fourth, that in public, all members of the <gloss target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss>–IEP would continue the current stance: that the U.S. is prepared to
                    listen to any allied proposals for alternative sanctions against the Soviet
                    Union, and that the U.S. has a clear idea of where it is going. If questioned
                    closely about the status of consultations with the Europeans, all members would
                    refer the questions to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>.</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">Finally, that these four points would be put in a paper for
                        the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>.</hi>
               </p>
                <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWE_1">Brock</persName> pointed out that in
                    dealings with the Soviet Union, it was possible to make real progress if the
                    agreements and <pb n="703" facs="0734" xml:id="pg_703"/>their implementation
                    were kept out of the limelight. The same was true for agreements with the
                    Europeans.</p>
                <p>The discussion then turned to several immediate cases before the Commerce
                    Department for exceptions to the current temporary denial orders. First, the
                    Cameron Iron Works, the German subsidiary of which had signed a contract in
                    March with the Soviet Union for oil and gas equipment which was not for use on
                    the Yamal pipeline. The deal had been caught by the June extension of the
                    December sanctions.</p>
                <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Regan</persName> pointed out that the
                        <gloss target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss>–IEP could not sit “like a Supreme
                    Court” rendering judgment on individual cases. <hi rend="italic">It was
                        necessary to give general guidance to Commerce and allow the Secretary to
                        make the individual decisions. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName> said that he had the authority to grant exceptions
                        to the orders on the basis of hardship, but that for exceptions on the basis
                        of “unintended effects” he needed higher authority. He said that in general
                        the U.S. sanctions and denial orders were a tough policy that had caused a
                        great deal of economic damage both in Europe and the United States: what was
                        needed now was sensible decisions to ameliorate them.</hi>
               </p>
                <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> stated that if we
                    granted exceptions to U.S. companies, it would cause an uproar in Europe greater
                    than that caused by the grain sales agreement extension. Secretary <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> stated that the
                        criteria should be to distinguish between American and European companies.
                        If harm were being caused to European companies, then this would induce them
                        to pressure their governments to change their positions; if the damage were
                        being caused to U.S. companies, then an exception should be made.</hi>
                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName> stated that he now
                    had all the guidance he needed to make his decisions on the hardship cases.</p>
                <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName> then raised the
                    “unintended effects” category. Hewlett Packard and several other computer
                    companies had service contracts with Dresser France on office computers which
                    had been sold to Dresser France. An exception was needed to allow Hewlett
                    Packard and the other companies to repair these computers. <hi rend="italic">There was general approval in the <gloss target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss> that
                        these exceptions should be made.</hi>

                <p rend="center">The Soviet Gas Pipeline in Perspective</p>
                <p rend="center">KEY JUDGMENTS</p>
                <p>1. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has used imports from the West to
                    enhance its military capabilities.</p>
                <p>—By obtaining goods and technology, legally and illegally, that contribute
                    directly to the production and technical sophistication of weapon systems.</p>
                <p>—By expanding the base of industries of particular importance to military
                    production.</p>
                <p>—And, more generally, by easing economic problems, thereby reducing the burden of
                    defense.</p>
                <p>2. The rapid increase in Soviet imports from the West in the 1970s was made
                    possible by large windfall gains in export earnings due to the surge in oil
                    prices and the willingness of Western countries to provide large credits, most
                    of which were government guaranteed. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                    is encountering growing economic difficulties, which will make it more difficult
                    for Moscow to increase its imports from the West in the future. The outlook for
                    most Soviet exports, including oil, is not favorable, and Western banks are
                    unwilling to extend new long-term credits without government guarantees.</p>
                <p>3. Only the increase in gas exports through the Siberia-to-Western Europe
                    pipeline will prevent a marked decline in Soviet hard currency imports in the
                    1980s. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> almost certainly will be able
                    to meet scheduled deliveries of gas through the pipeline without diverting
                    Soviet equipment from domestic uses. Enough equipment has already been
                    delivered, or soon will be, to enable the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                    to meet likely West European demand for gas until the late 1980s. By then,
                    Moscow will probably be able to produce enough modern turbines and compressors
                    to bring the line to full capacity, or will have found new sources of equipment
                    for any it may have lost as a result of US actions. Meeting gas delivery
                    commitments and becoming self-sufficient in turbines and compressors will impose
                    costs on the Soviets in inefficiencies and shifts in resources and effort.</p>

                <p>4. While gas exports are the most promising future source of hard currency, oil
                    exports still account for some 50 percent of Soviet export earnings, and it is
                    important for Moscow to minimize their future decline. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> depends on the West for specialized oil
                    exploration, drilling, pumping, and processing equipment. As its deposits of
                    high-quality, accessible oil are depleted, the Soviets are turning to more
                    remote oil and gas fields and more costly exploitation techniques. But they lag
                    badly behind the West in the necessary technology. Without any access to Western
                    equipment, the adverse impact on Soviet oil production could be as high as 10
                    percent of output by 1990.</p>
                <p>5. Moscow’s best hope of improving its strained hard currency position in the
                    longer run is to secure the cooperation of Western Europe in building large new
                    pipelines for the delivery of additional natural gas in the late 1980s or in the
                    1990s. With enormous gas reserves and a powerful incentive to earn more hard
                    currency, Moscow is prepared to sell as much gas as the West Europeans will
                    accept. There is potential uncovered gas demand in Western Europe to fill not
                    only the Siberia-to-Western Europe pipeline now being built, but also a second
                    and third strand during the 1990s. Development of these large gas projects
                    currently requires Western pipe, equipment, and credit and markets as part of a
                    package deal, although Soviet need for these Western products will diminish as
                    Moscow develops its domestic gas equipment industry. Alternative sources of gas
                    exist, notably in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and in North Africa,
                    although they are in general relatively costly and some are considered
                    insecure.</p>
                <p>6. It will be difficult to enlist Allied cooperation in restricting trade with
                    the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Beyond economic incentives, there
                    are political considerations that fuel the West Europeans’ reluctance to accept
                    restrictions on trade and credits to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.
                    These include:</p>
                <p>—Their desire to restore the detente climate in Europe and to avoid exacerbating
                    East-West strains.</p>
                <p>—Their desire to maintain access to Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>—Their belief that economic and other ties with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will influence Soviet behavior.</p>
                <p>These political considerations, combined with the economic incentive, continue to
                    limit West European cooperation with the United States in restricting East-West
                    trade.</p>
                <p>7. The crux of the problem lies in developing with the West European countries a
                    common understanding of the strategic implications of East-West trade. Such an
                    understanding has been notably absent, but the chances of achieving it may be
                    better now that the West Europeans are becoming more aware of the issues and the
                    depth of US concern. Allied leaders have asserted that they will not conduct
                    economic war<pb n="706" facs="0737" xml:id="pg_706"/>fare against the Soviet
                    Union. But adequate analysis and discussion can lead to a common conclusion:</p>
                <p>—That deficiencies in security policies among the Western Allies have resulted in
                    Soviet acquisition of militarily important technology, financial subsidies, and,
                    potentially, an important role in Western Europe’s energy supply.</p>
                <p>—That taking steps to withhold these benefits is merely prudent security policy
                    which Allies owe to each other, and can be seen as self-protection rather than
                    economic warfare.</p>
                <p>8. Accordingly, Western countries might be willing to cooperate in:</p>
                <p>—Developing and implementing broader and tighter <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> restrictions.</p>
                <p>—Agreeing to stricter limits on the terms and volume of government-supported
                    credits.</p>
                <p>—Developing other energy sources as an alternative to additional Soviet
                    pipelines.</p>
                <p>9. Making Western military-related technology, subsidized credit, and locked-in
                    gas markets available helps the Soviet military buildup. Western governments
                    would then be under increased pressure to raise defense costs, a move that
                    requires heavy taxes, sometimes leads to deficit spending, and contributes to
                    inflation and high interest rates. The United States is now committing some 6
                    percent of its economic effort and the European Allies some 4 percent of theirs
                    to defend against a Soviet military threat that consumes 14 percent or more of
                    their <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>. At the same time Western leaders are
                    asking their citizens to carry a heavy defense burden they are pursuing policies
                    that help the Soviets maintain a threat that adds to this burden.</p>
                <p>10. This Estimate includes analysis of the potential impact of Western actions,
                    including actions by Western Europe and Japan, on Soviet economic and military
                    programs:</p>
                <p>—The reduced availability of hard currency and energy would make more difficult
                    the decisions Moscow must make among key priorities in the 1980s—sustaining
                    growth in military programs, feeding the population, modernizing the civilian
                    economy, supporting its East European clients, and expanding (or maintaining)
                    its overseas involvements.</p>
                <p>—While the cumulative impact of Western actions would clearly increase pressures
                    on Soviet decisionmakers, we cannot judge how they would choose to spread such
                    losses throughout the economy.</p>
                <p>—Because economic growth will be slow through the 1980s, annual additions to
                    national output will be too small to simultaneously meet the incremental demands
                    that planners are placing on the domestic economy. Even now, stagnation in the
                    production of key industrial <pb n="707" facs="0738" xml:id="pg_707"/>materials
                    is retarding growth in machinery output—the source of military hardware,
                    investment goods, and consumer durables.</p>
                <p>—Shortfalls in Soviet hard currency earnings due to Western actions probably
                    would force further cuts in imports of machinery and equipment. Moscow fears
                    that reductions in food imports would cause popular unrest and wants to avoid
                    the bottlenecks that would be caused by cutting imports of industrial materials,
                    such as steel.</p>
                <p>—In the longer term, cuts in machinery imports would retard progress in
                    modernizing a number of industrial sectors—steel, machine building, oil
                    refining, robotics, microelectronics, transportation, and construction
                    equipment—at a time when Moscow is counting on a strategy of limited investment
                    growth and relying instead on productivity growth.</p>
                <p>—Placing controls on energy-related equipment and technology would aggravate
                    civilian industrial bottlenecks and, therefore, might cause civilian
                    encroachment on defense production, such as a reallocation of some
                    military-oriented metallurgical and machine-building facilities to produce the
                    embargoed oil and gas equipment.</p>
                <p>—The combination of enhanced <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> controls
                    and foreign exchange shortfalls would raise the cost of Soviet military
                    modernization while at the same time weakening the industrial base for military
                    production.</p>
                <p>11. The relative impact of Western economic measures on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> can be estimated only as general orders of
                    magnitude, as follows:</p>
                <p>—Eschewing future gas projects—up to $10 billion a year in the 1990s.</p>
                <p>—Denying all oil equipment and technology—about $10 billion a year for several
                    years but then declining.</p>
                <p>—Eliminating interest subsidies—less than $500 million a year.</p>
                <p>In the long run, tighter <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> restrictions on
                    militarily sensitive technology (including technology and equipment that
                    indirectly contributes to significant improvements in weapon systems) would
                    perhaps be the most valuable action for the West. Such action would retard major
                    improvements in Soviet weaponry, which the West would be forced to counter.
                    While the dollar value of such action is difficult to estimate, the savings in
                    terms of Western spending for defense annually would probably come to billions
                    of dollars.</p>
                <p>12. Moscow has the means to react to Western pressure by giving defense needs an
                    even greater priority than at present and by pursuing a more truculent foreign
                    policy. The Soviets meet their fundamental military requirements from their own
                    large industrial base. Military programs, moreover, have great momentum and
                    political support; they would not easily be scaled back, although the rate of
                    modernization <pb n="708" facs="0739" xml:id="pg_708"/>could be slowed. Even so,
                    Moscow could not escape the reality that its basic choices between military and
                    economic programs would become more difficult, at a time when a change in
                    leadership might also make those choices less predictable.</p>

                    reported on the rules being followed in connection with sanction violations.
                    Temporary denial orders (TDO’s) are being issued against alleged violators,
                    whether the violation was a company decision or taken under governmental duress.
                    They are also applied to subsidiaries and affiliates where appropriate. TDO’s do
                    not extend to non-oil and gas related items. We are getting many requests for
                    exceptions on hardship grounds, such as the Sensor case where a Dutch court has
                    ordered the company to ship. Unintended effects cases are also coming in, such
                    as a case preventing supply for an Australian pipeline. He said there should not
                    be any exceptions at this time—it would represent opening Pandora’s box. But
                    after Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> has had his
                    meetings in New York, we should consider refining the rules. If equipment or
                    technology is for free world projects, if significant hardships are being
                    imposed on innocent third parties and if the project involved reduces energy
                    dependency on the Soviet Union, we should examine a change in rules.</p>

                    U.S. companies. He agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName>’s recommendation, but the domestic implications should

                    Ambassador Hermes (of West Germany) said last night that they don’t agree with

                    A number of Europeans have told me that if all of this leads to greater allied
                    unity, it was worth doing. But we are on extremely weak legal grounds if our
                    actions are seen as punitive rather than deterrent. How is a pipeline in
                    Australia a deterrent? We must be very precise about the standards on which we
                    make our decisions.</p>

                    Procedurally, you authorized discussions with the Europeans if they wanted to
                    have a meeting. Foreign Secretary Pym asked for a meeting. I accepted. Since
                    then they have had trouble getting together—the British, Germans and Italians
                    want to have a meeting. The French believe if they wait we will fold. We have
                    maintained the posture that we will meet, but they shouldn’t believe we’re
                    looking for a way out. We’re looking for a better approach to East-West economic
                    relations. The British, Germans and Italians understand this. The French don’t
                    yet. I have meetings set up in New York. The first is with <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Cheysson</persName> next Sunday. At some point, they will
                    probably decide on a joint meeting. They will have to take the initiative. If we
                    move from the pipeline to the broader issues of East-West economic relations, we
                    must involve the Japanese and perhaps also the Canadians, at least on a parallel
                    track. I have to play with the situation as it emerges. There must be room for
                    maneuvering and exploration.</p>
                <p>We should aspire to a strengthening of <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>
                    controls, a list revision and a firming of the process of policing. The question
                    of insufficient funds must be addressed.</p>
                <p>Secondly, credit restraints on the Soviet Union must be addressed. It is easier
                    to persuade people now not to be too liberal on international lending. It is
                    difficult to police and define. We need to emphasize both substance and
                    procedure. The deals are very complex.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, we must try to get agreement on not selling certain key oil and gas
                    technologies and equipment to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. U.S.
                    companies control a major portion of this material, so the Europeans can’t say
                    we’re being unfair. One possibility might be no government guaranteed credit for
                    this material.</p>
                <p>Finally, there is concern over the Soviets taking a bigger share of market than
                    implied by the first pipeline. The temptation is there to go ahead and gain a
                    much higher percent of the European market. We must reserve space in the market
                    for additional Norwegian North Sea gas. There have been changes in attitude in
                    Norway due to changed market conditions. We are considering an interesting
                    combination of Dutch/Norwegian gas in the future.</p>
                <p>The British don’t want to discuss this without discussing food exports to the
                        <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. We should reply that our policy is
                    no subsidized sales of American grain. There is no all-out trade war
                    planned—we’re talking about European vulnerability. The Europeans are out of
                    their minds to put themselves in the position of reliance on Soviet energy they
                    are moving towards.</p>
                <p>As I told <persName corresp="#p_HG_1">Geoffrey Howe</persName>, they’re not
                    offering us something. This is an alliance—we see Soviet behavior, technology
                    transfer and other unacceptable actions. Let’s get together and decide what to
                    do about it. The whole atmosphere is cockeyed now.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                <p>A group of us (including <persName corresp="#p_WWA_1">Allen Wallis</persName>)
                    met last Friday<note n="2" xml:id="d215fn2">September 17.</note> with Columbia
                    professor Seweryn Bialer, who passed on the views of upper-middle-level Soviet
                    officials and experts to which his recent three-week stay in Moscow exposed him.
                    His presentation put forward Soviet <pb n="713" facs="0744" xml:id="pg_713"/>views in all their variety and even contradictoriness. Two important points
                    stood out:</p>
                <p>1) <hi rend="italic">The Soviets claim to take the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration</hi> change of course in foreign
                    policy <hi rend="italic">very seriously</hi>, to the point of alarm.</p>
                <p>2) But, while cautious and conscious of their own problems, <hi rend="italic">the
                        Soviets are not (yet?) considering how to adjust to the new US policy</hi>,
                    both because of paralyzed decision-making and ideological rigidity.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Views</p>
                <p>Like other visitors to the Soviet Union, Bialer heard that the early hopes for
                    the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration have yielded
                    to a recognition that a new policy is here to stay. Its distinctive features are
                    seen as a quest for <hi rend="italic">military superiority</hi>, resort to “<hi rend="italic">economic warfare</hi>”, escalation of <hi rend="italic">anti-Soviet rhetoric</hi>, etc. But even more important is the <hi rend="italic">redefinition of US aims</hi>—in place of traditional US
                    demands for improved Soviet behavior, these officials see a new focus on
                    weakening and destabilizing the Soviet system itself, with the aim of driving
                    the Soviets off the world stage (“rollback of Soviet global influence”). In this
                    view, the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration’s
                    ambitious aims are explained by the President’s personal determination, the
                    representation of more radical viewpoints among close advisers, his effective
                    manipulation of Congress and the public, and his ability to count on European
                    loyalties in a pinch. (These Soviets, for example, reportedly take INF
                    deployment for granted.)</p>
                <p>Bialer found some Soviets believing a US course correction will occur in time,
                    but not a return to 70’s-style detente. What most believe, he claims, is that
                    detente itself was a kind of fluke and that (with the Vietnam defeat receding)
                    an older, more powerful, and more ideological tradition of US policy has
                    reasserted itself. All the more important Soviet officials he spoke to expressed
                    this “hard line” outlook.</p>
                <p>Bialer also notes that the new Soviet assessment has not been fully digested.
                    Intellectually and diplomatically, the Soviets consider themselves in a “<hi rend="italic">holding pattern</hi>”, for several reasons. Their caution
                    reflects 1) their own policy overextension, as in Afghanistan and Poland; 2) the
                    priority of their European “peace offensive”; 3) the immobility created by the
                    succession and 4) a growing preoccupation with domestic affairs.</p>
                <p>As described to Bialer, this holding pattern is likely to endure for some time.
                    No major decisions, he was told, are being taken now. (The Soviets seem on the
                    ultimate “continuing resolution”.) It is said that every major policy is a
                    matter of inertia, with no hope at middle levels that new proposals can gain a
                    hearing. Even apart from the succession, however, ideological rigidity
                    strengthens this standpat posture: The Soviets do not, even in principle,
                    consider US objections to their behav<pb n="714" facs="0745" xml:id="pg_714"/>ior in the Third World to be legitimate (even in the limited form of specific
                    demands, not all-out warfare). Promoting left-wing insurgencies is a matter of
                    both right and duty, of “inevitable progress” from which the Soviets, for
                    ideological reasons, cannot stand aside. (The absence of internal Soviet reform
                    is explained by Bialer in the same way. While taking its economic weaknesses
                    seriously, the Soviet leadership is at present <hi rend="italic">incapable</hi>
                    of devising any reform program; but even when it <hi rend="italic">becomes</hi>
                    capable, it will oppose all but superficial changes so as to protect its own
                    power.)</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Assessment</p>
                <p>There was this interesting contradiction in the Soviet attitudes Bialer picked
                    up: a <hi rend="italic">growing anxiety</hi>, especially about U.S. ultimate
                    purposes and military programs, but also a <hi rend="italic">rejection of
                        accommodation</hi> in those areas where we have objected to Soviet behavior.
                    (He heard admissions that although the Soviet arms control positions were, like
                    ours, propagandistic, they would not and could not soon be changed.)</p>
                <p>Either one of these conflicting views could, in principle, give way to the other.
                    Fear of war could in time lead to serious negotiations; alternately, Soviet
                    unwillingness to compromise may lead to still greater arms efforts and more
                    belligerent diplomacy. Our policy, of course, should take both possibilities
                    into account, but if Bialer is right neither adjustment is likely soon. Instead,
                        <hi rend="italic">we may witness a cautious Soviet hunkering-down but
                        without any interest in resolving disagreements</hi>.</p>
                <p>This was a very suggestive report. Unfortunately, it is not easy to interpret the
                    findings of even so experienced an observer as Seweryn Bialer. As he himself
                    acknowledges, the views communicated to him represent some <hi rend="italic">mix</hi> of real convictions and what the Soviets <hi rend="italic">want</hi> us to believe they think. An example is the issue of rhetoric,
                    which bulked very large in what Bialer heard. He reported both 1) that the
                    Soviets are frightened of the President’s rhetoric and 2) that they consider it
                    one source of public support for his policies.</p>
                <p>How true the former is we simply cannot know. At a minimum, the disparity between
                    the Administration’s early talk and its cautious subsequent record (on Cuba, for
                    example) must partly calm Soviet fears (although they may, as Bialer heard,
                    believe the President <hi rend="italic">would</hi> act much more firmly and
                    decisively in something like the Iranian hostage crisis). But if what they <hi rend="italic">really</hi> are convinced of is the latter, that the
                    President’s talk strengthens his internal position, then it may be to their
                    advantage to suggest that his strong rhetoric adds to international instability
                    and makes accommodation less likely. Certainly in Europe this is the Soviet
                    line—to focus their propaganda on a picture of US irresponsibility and
                    unreliability, putting the burden on us to show that this is not true. Their
                    complaints center on the President as <pb n="715" facs="0746" xml:id="pg_715"/>they would have him be (quick on the trigger and ready for war) rather than on
                    the sophisticated combination of uncompromising rhetoric, ambitious proposals,
                    and prudence in action that has in fact made him a more formidable opponent.</p>

               </p>
                <p>I am dubious about the approach <gloss target="#t_EUR_1">EUR</gloss> has
                    recommended. It is not enough to plan on being neither too soft nor too harsh.
                    Nor will running down a checklist of complaints get us anywhere—indeed it will
                    tend to reinforce <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s belief that
                    our true aim is to force Moscow to abandon its entire foreign policy and its
                    effort to achieve equal superpower status.</p>
                <pb n="716" facs="0747" xml:id="pg_716"/>
                <p>The trick is to find a way, without altering the substance of our positions, to
                    convince the Soviets that it is in their interest to try to do business with
                    this Administration. With the succession struggle now well underway, it is more
                    important than ever that the Soviet leaders see neither discontinuity nor total
                    rigidity when they peer at us through the window your talk with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> will provide. Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> will be fully prepared to parry and
                    counterpunch if you simply recite the litany of complaints and US positions; but
                    he will be thrown off balance if you show a genuine interest in doing business.
                    Thus, for both substantive and tactical reasons, you need to shift the terms of
                    reference from what the Soviets are probably anticipating, without letting them
                    think a general shift in our policies is in the offing.</p>
                <p>One way to do this is to identify a category of issues on which, in our view,
                    there <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be common interests and room for movement
                    on both sides. Even if this doesn’t produce early results—which may be
                    impossible no matter how you skin the cat—it will at least help focus the
                    dialogue on some constructive possibilities. It would also show that this
                    Administration is capable of identifying common interests. And by focussing on
                    relatively few (albeit important) issues, the Soviets would correctly infer
                    that, while narrow progress is possible, across-the-board cooperation is not. I
                    would place in this category: START/INF; nuclear non-proliferation; Southern
                    Africa; Afghanistan; and—paradoxically, perhaps—Poland.</p>
                <p>A second category consists of issues on which our purpose is essentially to <hi rend="italic">warn</hi> the Soviets to avoid actions that would threaten our
                    interests and thus further harm the relationship. In this category would be:
                    Nicaragua; support for Cuban and Libyan subversion generally; the Persian Gulf.
                    By casting our views on these issues as warnings (in contrast to expressing our
                    desire for progress in category one), we would be making clear that we expect
                    Soviet caution, not cooperation, where our vital interests are at stake but
                    theirs are not. Moreover, by addressing category one more positively, the
                    Soviets will take more seriously a don’t-tread-on-me line in category two.</p>
                <p>A third category consists of issues on which we neither look for Soviet
                    cooperation nor need—or want—to warn the Soviets: the Middle East and
                    Sino-American relations. The Soviet frustration about their diplomatic impotence
                    in the Middle East is symptomatic of their complex about not being treated as
                    our equal as a world-class political player. In addition to wanting to keep them
                    on the diplomatic sidelines in order to preserve our unique role and freedom of
                    maneuver, we should consider letting them play only at a price. Similarly, we
                    should let the mystique of Sino-American relations worry the Soviets, neither
                    using our China tie threateningly nor being apologetic. Thus, you should offer
                    nothing on these two questions, and respond—with a certain aloofness—only if
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> says something
                    outrageous.</p>
                <pb n="717" facs="0748" xml:id="pg_717"/>
                <p>There are, of course, other issues to be discussed that don’t fit neatly into
                    this construct, namely: Soviet human rights performance and bilateral matters.
                    In addition, the question of a summit will either come up directly or lurk in
                    the background, depending on how the uncertainty about future Soviet leadership
                    affects how <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> plays that issue. The
                    idea of identifying issues on which we believe progress is possible fits well
                    with the concept of a “carefully prepared” summit. The Soviets <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be willing to pay a substantive price for a summit; but it’s up to
                    us to steer them toward the issues on which we would consider movement helpful
                    in laying the basis for a summit.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conduct of the Meeting</p>
                <p>I suggest that you be quite explicit about your belief that there are <hi rend="italic">areas in which there ought to be room for progress</hi>. By
                    discussing these first, you can show your desire to accentuate the positive:</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">START/INF</hi>. It’s important—but it won’t be easy—to
                    convince <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that we are quite
                    serious about wanting agreements. The Soviets should share our interest in
                    reducing nuclear forces, especially the most threatening systems. The Soviets
                    appear more willing to move in <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> than
                    INF. We want progress in <hi rend="italic">both</hi>. Soviet moves in these
                    negotiations would help the relationship generally.</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">Non-Proliferation</hi>. This is a long-standing but
                    now-dormant area of clear common interest. We would like to set up regular
                    technical discussions. (We obviously aren’t prepared to discuss specific
                    concerns, e.g., Pakistan.)</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">Southern Africa</hi>. Our aim is to make the Soviets realize
                    that their support for the Cuban presence in Angola is an obstacle to a Namibian
                    settlement, and that this position will become politically untenable. Put in
                    this predicament, the Soviets might have a common—if expedient—interest with us
                    in arriving at a timetable for Cuban withdrawal. They will be reluctant to help
                    if they think we’ll then trumpet it as a major Soviet retreat; so we’ve got to
                    convince them that a constructive approach will earn them some credit.</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">Afghanistan</hi>. It is very doubtful that experts’ talks will
                    lead to results in the foreseeable future. But this is a good way to keep the
                    issue alive, and it’s useful to have a mechanism in place in the event that the
                    Soviets some day decide to look for an exit. We should therefore propose another
                    round.</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">Poland</hi>. The point is not that US-Soviet discussions per
                    se could lead to progress; indeed, the Soviets would not welcome talks on
                    Poland. But it is an issue on which a strong case can be made that there <hi rend="italic">should</hi> be a common interest in progress. The current
                    situation is only aggravating economic decline and political volatility. It’s
                    not stable and not safe. A controlled renewal of the reform process would
                    threaten <pb n="718" facs="0749" xml:id="pg_718"/>Soviet interests less than
                    does the attempt to suppress the movement. Conversely, you should stress that
                    our aims are limited: we want reconciliation, not chaos.</p>
                <p>You should be equally candid in identifying areas where our <hi rend="italic">message is essentially a warning:</hi>
               </p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">Nicaragua</hi>. The basic point is: we will do what is
                    necessary to combat subversion in Central America. Such actions as transferring
                    MiG’s would be intolerable and would leave us with no choice but to conclude
                    that Moscow isn’t genuinely interested in a better relationship.</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">The Persian Gulf</hi>. We don’t claim vital interests
                    everywhere—as <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> once accused
                        <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> of doing—but let there be no
                    mistake about the Gulf. This is already a highly unstable region, and it could
                    become dangerous if the Soviets attempt to exploit the instability.</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">Libyan and Cuban Subversion</hi>. You will want to reinforce
                    whatever concerns the Soviets have about getting drawn into a confrontation with
                    us as a result of the recklessness of their clients. We may not have much
                    success in weakening the Soviet-Cuban relationship, but the Soviets can be
                    convinced to put more distance between themselves and <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>. You need not recite a litany of proxy
                    misdeeds in order to make the basic argument.</p>
                <p>I suggest you lay out for the President your plans for the <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> meeting in the above manner,
                    stressing:</p>
                <p>—that there is no change in substance;</p>
                <p>—that the aim is to dangle the prospect of making headway on specific issues;</p>
                <p>—that a summit should be linked to progress on these issues (without being more
                    specific than that).</p>

                    what manner these talks should be conducted since he didn’t know the Secretary’s

                <p>To begin, <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi>
                    wanted to direct the Secretary’s attention to the following: the Soviet
                    leadership could not fail to note that the new Administration in Washington has
                    radically changed its policy toward <pb n="720" facs="0751" xml:id="pg_720"/>the
                    Soviet Union, and changed it for the worse. U.S. policy is creating tensions
                    between the Soviet Union and the United States. Statements made in Washington to
                    the effect that the Soviet Union has a different social system, that it is a
                    socialist country, has a different philosophy, has a different view of the world
                    and therefore no common language with the U.S. could be given a hostile
                    interpretation to create problems between the two countries. They also could
                    suggest that no accord could be reached and that no practical steps could be
                    undertaken between the two powers. Moreover, the U.S. had declared that much
                    that had been accomplished in the past in bilateral relations was invalid, and
                    this had led to a politically tense relationship. In the past, other
                    administrations had established relationships with the Soviet Union, and under
                    Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, <persName corresp="#p_KRT_1">Kennedy</persName>,
                    Nixon and <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>, relations with the
                    Soviet Union were normal despite different political and social systems. There
                    was then a common language that could be used. Looking back, he could remember
                    that in World War II the Soviets and Americans were even allied against fascist
                    Germany although they had different systems.</p>
                <p>Was all of this past record in error? Present U.S. policy seemed to indicate that
                    this might be true. In Washington the Soviet Union is regarded as anathema.
                    There is no respect for the different social system in the Soviet Union and
                    statements are being made which are not worth characterizing by their proper
                    name.</p>
                <p>The U.S. and the Soviet Union do have different systems, but from the days of
                    Lenin, the Soviet Union has tried to maintain business-like relations with
                    countries with differing political and economic systems and has always regarded
                    peaceful coexistence as one of its political principles. The Soviet Union always
                    has wanted to live in peace and to avoid resolving conflicts by force of arms.
                    This remains the basic policy of the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>In view of the above, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to
                    know whether Washington is following a line seeking to deny respect to the
                    Soviet system and even to repudiate past U.S.-Soviet accomplishments. Must this
                    situation continue to escalate? Does Washington believe that the catastrophe
                    which threatens cannot be avoided? If this is the U.S. line toward the Soviet
                    Union, then where is this going to lead? Does Washington believe that unless
                    U.S. conditions are accepted a conflict or war are inevitable? What are your
                    views on that subject? <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that
                    he was eager to know because he had to convey his impressions to the Soviet
                    leadership and to President <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>. He
                    added that he wanted to have a sincere exchange of views with the Secretary and
                    would like to hear his answers.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> noted <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s questions and added that he also had asked himself, in
                    preparation for this meeting, where U.S.-Soviet <pb n="721" facs="0752" xml:id="pg_721"/>relations should be going. He said he remembered that, when
                    he was in government some eight or nine years ago, relations between the two
                    countries were constructive, whereas now these relations were tense. Therefore
                    we have to ask how to improve the situation.</p>
                <p>In his talks with the President, whom he knows well and with whom he can
                    communicate easily, he has discussed these matters and therefore could state the
                    following. It is fair to say that the President wants the U.S. to be a strong
                    country with a strong economy and that he wants it to be militarily secure and
                    also in the forefront of world affairs. If other countries show a pattern of
                    behavior that leads to tensions and to unsatisfactory relations, the U.S. is
                    prepared to look after its interests and the interests of the world. Also the
                    President and the American people would prefer to have constructive relations
                    with the Soviet Union. It was therefore necessary to examine why things got to
                    be so bad. This in turn could give clues as to what to do about it.</p>
                <p>The Secretary said that when he was out of office the U.S. did not engage in an
                    arms build-up. However, the Soviet Union was engaged in a steady and impressive
                    build-up of its armed forces. Although the Soviet Union was a signatory of the
                    Helsinki Accord, the behavior of the Soviet Union was not in line with that
                    Accord. Other events took place at that time that did not help constructive
                    relations between the two powers. Here the Secretary would have to mention
                    Afghanistan, Poland and other events where not words but deeds made matters
                    worse.</p>
                <p>This is a whole pattern of behavior. It makes the President ask himself what
                    relations the Soviet Union really wanted to have with the United States.</p>
                <p>Here, the Secretary said, he had to explain our approach to values. Values such
                    as human freedom, human dignity, and free movement are basic to the American
                    outlook. These principles go back some 200 hundred years; they are the
                    principles of the American Revolution. Americans struggle to defend these
                    ideals. When looking at the situation today, when these values and principles
                    were being violated (especially after the signature of the Helsinki agreement),
                    Americans begin to worry. He was saying this not to engage in rhetoric but to
                    show how much Americans do care about these values.</p>
                <p>Looking at such principles as the non-use of force or respect for human rights,
                    the Soviet Union’s actions are inconsistent with these principles. It would be
                    worthwhile to look at the final act.<note n="2" xml:id="d217fn2">Reference is to
                        the Helsinki Final Act of August 1975.</note> It mentions family ties,
                    reunification of families, etc. (Here the Secretary read from the Helsinki
                    agreement on unification of families, freedom of thought, <pb n="722" facs="0753" xml:id="pg_722"/>belief, civil rights, and so on.) When people
                    in the Soviet Union who monitor the observance of these provisions are
                    persecuted, this is a violation of the Helsinki agreement. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had already discussed these issues with
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> on previous occasions. The
                    Secretary stressed that the U.S. attaches great importance to the problem of
                    free emigration by Soviet Jews; this issue continues to be of considerable
                    importance in America today. He added that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> would pass on a list of names to
                    Minister <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>. We believe some
                    progress could be made in this area. We are not raising these concerns for
                    propaganda purposes, but because the issue is important to the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>The Secretary said that history shows that the U.S. and the Soviet Union have
                    been able to conclude agreements and resolve issues. As examples, there are the
                    Austrian State Treaty, the Hotline Agreement, the Nuclear Test Ban, the Four
                    Power Agreement on Berlin, the Incidents at Sea Agreement, and the <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> Agreement. These were all of a constructive
                    nature, and they are still in force. They show that sometimes ways can be found
                    to address certain problems jointly. But the pattern of behavior described—the
                    situation in Poland and in Afghanistan, the role of Cuba in the Caribbean area,
                    the situation in Central America, the delivery of weapons to Nicaragua—all makes
                    it difficult to maintain the peaceful relations <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> has talked about. The U.S. side would like to review
                    prospects on issues where the sides might focus and do constructive work. At the
                    same time this has to be done against the background of a pattern of behavior
                    that is not acceptable to the American side.</p>
                <p>The U.S. side is trying to reduce the arms build-up, the Secretary said. Having
                    talked to his negotiators he believed that negotiations in Geneva are being
                    conducted in a business-like and professional manner. This suggests a serious
                    intent to reduce arms. But the setting in which these talks are being conducted
                    makes progress difficult for the U.S. side.</p>
                <p>To sum up, the Secretary said that in the President’s view it is up to the Soviet
                    Union to determine what relations it wishes to have with the United States. The
                    U.S. side prefers a constructive and problem-solving approach. He had personally
                    seen this kind of approach at work in his dealings with the Soviet Union in the
                    past. The U.S. wants such an approach. We recognize that the Soviet Union is a
                    superpower and a key country in the world, and that it can therefore do much to
                    maintain such constructive relations. Things can go either way. However, one
                    must not forget the pattern of behavior that provides the background for the
                    actions we take. The President of the United States wants substantive exchanges;
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had also proposed to talk
                    substance. If relations are to assume a more constructive trend, then the <pb n="723" facs="0754" xml:id="pg_723"/>two countries together must examine
                    difficult issues facing them, and do so in parallel.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> thanked the
                    Secretary for his reply and said that the matters which the Secretary mentioned
                    could be divided into two categories. The first comprises major issues, such as
                    strategic arms and weapons of mass destruction, which affect not only relations
                    between the two countries but also the whole world; intermediate nuclear weapons
                    in Europe also is included in this group. In the second category there are
                    issues that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> could not regard as
                    truly important and which in no way should affect relations between the two
                    countries. Is it so important, for instance, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> asked, if Mr. or Mrs. or Miss so and so can or cannot
                    leave such and such a country, whether they get permission or do not get
                    permission to leave it? This is a tenth-rate question. And yet such issues seem
                    to have a pronounced effect on international relations. Also, the portion of the
                    Helsinki final act quoted by the Secretary was not the only provision of that
                    act. There were also provisions dealing with non-interference in internal
                    affairs of a sovereign country, especially when dealing with citizens of that
                    country. The act also said that a sovereign country had the right to decide
                    these issues as it saw fit.</p>
                <p>Looking at these two categories of questions <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wished to speak to those that the Secretary mentioned
                    last because these were the important issues. The Geneva talks on INF and <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> were of prime importance, but before
                    getting down to specifics he wanted to digress for a moment. The Secretary was
                    defending the thesis that present US policy is based on the perception that the
                    Soviet Union is threatening US interests, without ever clearly defining these
                    interests. These interests seemed to be in almost every corner of the globe, but
                    perhaps they do not reach as far as the suburbs of Moscow. The Soviet Union does
                    not intend to threaten any legitimate interests of the United States or its
                    allies or to limit American rights in any way. The Soviet Union does not want,
                    in contrast to the United States, to be first in armaments, because the Soviet
                    Union only wishes to defend the equality and equilibrium established over a
                    fairly long period of time between the two powers. For practical purposes this
                    balance also applies to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and to Warsaw
                    Treaty nations. The numbers indicate that there is a balance between the US and
                    the Soviet Union, including an approximate balance in strategic arms. In Europe
                    one could accept this balance or even say that the US and its allies have the
                    upper hand: when counting identical types of nuclear warheads, <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> has 50% more than the Warsaw Pact countries.
                    Therefore, looking at these objective figures, it is difficult to see how anyone
                    could claim that the Soviet Union is a threat to the US and to the world. In
                    addition the US has an advantage because Europe could be used as a launch pad by
                    the <pb n="724" facs="0755" xml:id="pg_724"/>US; the Soviet Union has no such
                    comparable facility. US intermediate range weapons can reach Soviet territory
                    while similar Soviet weapons cannot reach US territory.</p>
                <p>Turning to <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> and INF, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that he was glad to hear that, in
                    the Secretary’s view, both sides are engaged in serious discussions and that
                    Soviet efforts are serious, which they are. However, the current US position on
                        <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> and on INF could not form a basis
                    for an agreement. As matters now stand the US wants to gain advantage over the
                    Soviet Union in nuclear weapons, but such an approach is totally unacceptable to
                    the Soviet Union, whether you call it a zero option or something else. A
                    reduction as proposed by the U.S. is an attempt to disarm the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>Another issue <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to raise was
                    the fate of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. The Soviet side is not
                    only disappointed but ready to condemn this Administration’s view of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and its refusal to ratify the agreement. The
                    Soviet side views this rejection as a gross miscalculation because <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II would have been equally beneficial to
                    both sides. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had received various
                    answers from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> about US
                    attitudes toward the status of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. One of
                    them was that <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II was dead; another was
                    “we will continue to observe <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II.” What
                    were Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>’s views on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II? How could Washington treat so lightly an
                    agreement that took eight years to work out, carefully discussing and weighing
                    the pros and cons of every provision. After all that work, the US rejection
                    cannot but be viewed by the Soviet side as a bad omen for other treaties. Is
                    this an example of how the new Administration views serious agreements and
                    treaties? <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was also concerned
                    about two agreements which were signed but not ratified—namely, the treaty
                    dealing with peaceful nuclear explosions and the threshold test ban treaty.
                    These were apparently pigeon holed and forgotten although both sides had worked
                    on them very seriously. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was eager
                    to learn about their destiny. Another abandoned issue was the attempt to discuss
                    chemical weapons. Was it simply that the US side did not want to deal with this
                    question, without even proposing amendments or offering its own views? Such
                    refusals to discuss these matters are worrisome because Washington seems to be
                    moving at full speed to develop chemical weapons, and this could be interpreted
                    as a preparation for a chemical war. The Soviet Union is determined to reach an
                    agreement to ban chemical weapons, no less now than before. Statements that the
                    Soviet Union is using chemical weapons are untrue. The Secretary should not
                    believe in such tales because the Soviet Union has not and will not use chemical
                    weapons. Such use is against Soviet morals and principles. Perhaps somebody is
                    trying to mislead Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>. The Soviet
                    Union would welcome a US effort to take a fresh look at this issue.</p>
                <pb n="725" facs="0756" xml:id="pg_725"/>
                <p>There were some other questions on <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s mind which he wanted to mention; principally the
                    deployment of INF in Europe. There apparently is a US plan to develop various
                    forms of cruise missiles in different areas and thereby to encircle the Soviet
                    Union and to put it under pressure. It is possible to think that there might be
                    an agreement covering strategic arms in Europe, but that the US nevertheless
                    would have other weapons not covered by this agreement because they are neither
                    strategic nor stationed in Europe. And yet such weapons could reach various
                    parts of the Soviet Union such as Siberia, the Far East and Central Asia. The
                    Soviet Union will draw proper conclusions from such an approach and take
                    necessary defensive measures. Otherwise the US will some day fill the oceans and
                    seas around the Soviet Union with nuclear weapons and will say “we have duped
                    the Soviets”. We will never allow this to happen.</p>
                <p>Another issue that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wished to
                    discuss was the use of outer space for military purposes. The Soviets have noted
                    that there are some in the US who are considering such activities. It would not
                    be in the interest of either the US or the Soviet Union to use space for
                    military purposes. The policy of the Soviet Union is to maintain peace in outer
                    space and prevent it from becoming militarized. There are enough difficult
                    issues on earth without adding to them in outer space.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that there are other
                    bilateral agreements and forums which were either suspended, declared invalid or
                    allowed to lapse by the United States. The Soviet Union cannot understand why
                    Washington has decided to withdraw from certain contacts; this only weakens
                    Soviet/American relations. At one time Washington became enthusiastic about
                    placing limitations on arms deliveries to other countries. US-Soviet
                    Conventional Arms Treaty delegations met several times but then Washington
                    decided to slam the door shut on this endeavor. The Indian Ocean talks are
                    another example of the door suddenly being shut. There are other negotiations
                    which were never fully developed because the US did not want to continue.
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> summed up his statement by
                    saying that there were certain questions in Soviet-American relations and
                    international relations which deserved top priority.</p>
                <p>Having said that, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to move
                    on to the second category of questions, i.e., those that the Secretary mentioned
                    in the second half of his exposition. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> added that these categories were of course purely
                    arbitrary. In addition to Helsinki, there are other outstanding issues demanding
                    attention. One of them is Poland, especially when viewed in the context of the
                    Helsinki Final Act. The Poles would protest against any interference from any
                    party and in any international forum. Poland is a sovereign country, and the
                    Soviet Union is not involved in Polish internal affairs. It is for the Poles
                    themselves to settle their internal affairs. The Soviet Union is against <pb n="726" facs="0757" xml:id="pg_726"/>any economic sanctions, be they
                    directed against Poland or against any other countries. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was sure that Washington would realize
                    that sanctions could only be harmful in the long run; he referred to a statement
                    by <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> dealing with sanctions.</p>
                <p>As for Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> believed that,
                    in the context of the Helsinki Final Act, one could see two aspects to this
                    question: one internal and the other one external. Internal, domestic affairs
                    are a matter for the Afghan regime to settle. As for the external aspect, there
                    are invasions by armed bandits from Pakistan. It is an open book that this is
                    happening with the assistance of the United States. As soon as these armed
                    incursions stop, the Soviet Union will withdraw its troops from Afghanistan and
                    Afghanistan will be left alone, if effective guarantees can be obtained that no
                    external invasions into Afghanistan will recur. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> added that contacts will be established in Geneva, with
                    the indirect help from the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary General,
                    between representatives of Afghanistan and Pakistan. There is hope that they
                    will make some headway.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> appealed to <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> to consider the long range interests of
                    the United States and not to get involved in internal matters of other
                    countries. He asked again that the issue of a non-aligned Afghanistan be
                    considered by Washington, adding that if Pakistan could look at the issue in the
                    same spirit, the whole Afghanistan question could be taken off of the
                    agenda.</p>
                <p>With regard to Kampuchea and Vietnam, the Vietnamese were invited by the
                    Kampuchean people to help them. The genocide committed by the Pol Pot regime is
                    well-known. Now Kampuchea has a different regime and it is up to the Kampuchean
                    people to determine what regime they desire. Sihanouk seems to have revitalized
                    himself and some are opening doors to him—it’s a question if these are front or
                    back doors. At any rate, the Secretary should not play with puppets. In
                    conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> advised Washington
                    and other western countries not to interfere in Kampuchea, Afghanistan or
                    Poland.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> continued to say that there were
                    other international problems to be discussed, but that he was not sure whether
                    there was time enough to discuss them today. He wanted to hear the Secretary’s
                    view and those of the Administration on the following issues: the Middle East,
                    Africa, and the Caribbean. There are, of course, other important issues
                    deserving an exchange of views. However, there would have to be a focus on
                    crucial matters, matters dealing with war or peace in the world, and these
                    depend on the policy of big powers such as the Soviet Union and the United
                    States. In this regard, the Soviet Union and the United States are both “in the
                    same tower”.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was very eager to learn more about
                    the policy line, the mood, and the thoughts of the present US Administration, so
                    that he <pb n="727" facs="0758" xml:id="pg_727"/>could form a broad impression
                    in his mind about the possibility of doing business with the US. But the issues
                    of the first order are the arms race and the reduction of arms. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> stressed again that he wanted to
                    utilize this chance to exchange views on as many issues as possible because
                    there were so few chances to discuss these issues on other levels. He would be
                    willing to meet again if the Secretary agreed. He assured the Secretary that he
                    was not engaging in polemics. There are thoughts that had to be expressed. One
                    could not close one’s eyes, not wishing to look at reality, because reality
                    would open them again. There are urgent problems to be resolved, and to a great
                    extent the destiny of the world will depend on the policy that the US and the
                    Soviet Union will follow. We cannot be 100% responsible for the world, but “we
                    are all in the same boat”.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> replied that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s last question—where we are going—was a critical one.
                    He had listened for 1½ hours to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                    review on a wide range of topics and he had tried to ask himself what the
                    Foreign Minister was telling him. The Foreign Minister is a serious man whom the
                    Secretary met before and who represents a country of great importance and power.
                    The Secretary had listened and reviewed his notes. He found that his broad
                    reaction to many items raised by <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                    was that of discouragement, although here and there the two appeared to be
                    thinking along similar lines. The Secretary was frankly disappointed that
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> devoted so little time to
                    human problems and called them a tenth priority. Perhaps that is one of the
                    difficulties facing the two sides. Human problems always enjoy the highest
                    priority in the United States and the Secretary hoped that deep down <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would feel that too. The Secretary
                    remembered his visit to Leningrad with Soviet Minister of Trade Patolichev,<note n="3" xml:id="d217fn3">
                     <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>
                        recounted this story in greater detail in <hi rend="italic">Turmoil and
                            Triumph</hi>, pp. 117–119.</note> when they were taken to a cemetery. He
                    remembered walking down the central path of the cemetery to lay a wreath to
                    those who had died in that battle. He remembered tears in Patolichev’s eyes and
                    how the interpreter was so overcome by emotion that she could not interpret. The
                    Secretary was sure that all must feel that the well-spring of human values
                    should not be placed at tenth priority but must be emphasized. He reminded
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that the US view of the world
                    depended on how people were treated. He wanted <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> to know how much Americans cared about human problems.
                    This was necessary to understand present US policy.</p>
                <p>The Secretary then turned to the chemical weapons issue, saying that he was
                    somewhat puzzled by <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s approach.
                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had presented some
                    evidence on the use of chemical and bacteriological <pb n="728" facs="0759" xml:id="pg_728"/>weapons, which had created a big issue in the United
                    States. Questions are being asked about violations of treaties as well as
                    verification. Verification is a problem also with regard to peaceful nuclear
                    explosions in the Soviet Union, which appear to be above the agreed limit. Such
                    explosions are detected by certain devices which, although not without problems,
                    indicate explosions in excess of the agreed level. The Soviet Union has made
                    similar comments about explosions in the United States. This meant that the
                    problem of verification needs some more work.</p>
                <p>As for <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> pointed out that the treaty was presented to the US
                    Senate before the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration;
                    it was the previous administration that could not get it approved in that body.
                    In the eyes of the Senate, <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II is not a
                    good bargain for the United States. As for the status of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, the Secretary could confirm what
                        <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had previously said: that in a
                    basic sense, the US intends to observe its provisions in the broad dimensions,
                    but that <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II is not now a treaty; it is a
                    piece of history. The proposals advanced by the President of the United States
                    would be much better for the Soviet Union and for the world at large.</p>
                <p>Turning to Poland, Afghanistan and Kampuchea, the Secretary pointed out that
                    these were places where the US could not be credited with creating problems. The
                    existing problems there occurred otherwise. We were encouraged to hear that,
                    with the Secretary-General’s help, there might be some movement in Geneva this
                    November, that as a result Soviet troops might leave Afghanistan, and that an
                    independent regime might be established there. The US would only welcome such a
                    development. The talks conducted by Ambassador Hartmann on Afghanistan produced
                    no results. As for Poland, Soviet influence there is great, even decisive. It is
                    impossible not to see that martial law is still in effect, that dependent labor
                    unions are suppressed, that there is no dialogue between opposing parties and
                    that the economy is unable to produce enough to prevent deprivation. The US
                    would like to see a change in the situation and would only welcome such a
                    development.</p>
                <p>The Secretary also pointed out that it was the Vietnamese and not Americans who
                    were in Kampuchea. Any constructive moves by countries in that area, including
                    initiatives in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, deserve recognition. The
                    US would certainly be glad to see some movement in this area.</p>
                <p>The Secretary wanted <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> to know that
                    he was not engaging in propaganda when he said that a change for the better in
                    Afghanistan, Poland, Kampuchea would be welcome and that it would undoubtedly
                    improve the atmosphere for negotiations, including arms control issues.</p>
                <p>The Secretary remembered <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                    question about how far flung US interests were. The US is concerned about events
                    of the world <pb n="729" facs="0760" xml:id="pg_729"/>because there is no
                    isolated place in the world anymore. When outside the government, the Secretary
                    had been impressed by how easy it was to get involved in disputes although one
                    could not shoulder 100% of the world’s burden. The Falkland Islands are an
                    example: a remote place which in no time at all assumed great international
                    importance. This example illustrates how great powers such as the US and the
                    Soviet Union must pay attention to such developments.</p>
                <p>The Secretary had other comments on other matters and also on matters mentioned
                    by <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. The Secretary would welcome
                    an additional exchange of views with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. Before moving to other topics, the Secretary wanted to
                    mention Central America. Central America was a neighbor of the United States and
                    the US could see a pattern of arms flow to Nicaragua—not directly from the
                    Soviet Union—but arms which for the most part came from the Soviet Union and
                    were spreading to other countries in that area. He assured <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that the US would not stand still and
                    watch it. To be explicit, information was available that jet planes may be
                    delivered to Nicaragua. Such a development would be unacceptable to the US and,
                    as <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> had mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> before, the US would not stand still
                    for it.</p>
                <p>The Secretary assured <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> again that
                    he would like to continue an exchange of views and to make such exchanges more
                    constructive; it might be well, as previously mentioned to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>, to identify items of concern that
                    would be fruitful to discuss. The Secretary added that such discussions should
                    not be limited to meetings between <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and himself, but that others could be commissioned to
                    hold useful exchanges on some occasions.</p>
                <p>The Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> then discussed
                    the possibility of an additional meeting and agreed to meet on Monday, October
                    4, 1982 from 3:00–6:00 p.m. at the Soviet Mission. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> added that he would then discuss and react to the
                    Secretary’s statement on Nicaragua and also take up the Caribbean issue. He also
                    believed that the war between Iran and Iraq deserved some attention, because
                    although the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> were not involved,
                    this war could complicate other issues. Other items <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would like to take up at the next meeting were: an
                    exchange of views on the Law of the Sea Conference, the General Assembly—to see
                    what aims the Soviet Union and the US are pursuing there. In addition, he called
                    the Secretary’s attention to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security
                    Council, established by the great powers after WWII as an instrument for
                    preserving peace, but whose potential has never fully been realized. “The
                    Security Council does not play the role assigned to it. It is too weak in
                    character, it does not meet the requirements of the day.”</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> added that other issues to be taken up would
                    be Namibia and Southern Africa. <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>

                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> agreed that non-proliferation
                    was an internationally sensitive issue. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>

                        yesterday.<note n="2" xml:id="d218fn2">See <ref target="#d217">Document
                            217</ref>.</note> Judged against what we know of the kind of polemical
                    and aggressive stance <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> can take, I
                    was struck by how sober his presentation was. Clearly he wants to keep talking
                    to us, despite the claims some Soviets make that they have written off the
                        <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> led off. Noting that our relations
                    are “politically tense,” he asked whether the US wants “peaceful coexistence” or
                    confrontation. I replied that the choice was for Moscow to make; the
                    deterioration in our relations is a result of Soviet conduct—their persistent
                    refusal to honor agreements on human rights, their relentless military buildup,
                    and irresponsible activities in Poland, Afghanistan and elsewhere. I went
                    through our human rights concerns in particular detail—family reunification, the
                    persecution of the Helsinki Watch Group, Jewish emigration—putting them in the
                    context of their relationship to our own fundamental values.</p>
                <p>I made it clear that we are serious in our approach to INF, <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> and other negotiations. He agreed that the
                    talks in Geneva are proceeding in a businesslike fashion. Nonetheless, he
                    strongly criticized the specifics of our proposals, particularly the zero option
                    in INF, saying that it could not form the basis for an agreement. I stressed the
                    importance of verification, indicating that our concern applied not only to <pb n="731" facs="0762" xml:id="pg_731"/>
                  <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> and INF, but to agreements previously concluded (the chemical
                    weapons ban) as well as to agreements not yet ratified (Threshold Test Ban and
                    Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaties).</p>
                <p>In addition to arms control, I dwelt at some length on some of our regional
                    concerns: Poland, Afghanistan, Kampuchea, Central America. As you and I agreed,
                    on Nicaragua I told <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that we are
                    concerned by the pattern of arms shipments, and said that the introduction of
                    jet fighters into Nicaragua would be “unacceptable.”</p>
                <p>Toward the close of the meeting, I stressed that Soviet moves in areas such as
                    emigration, human rights, Poland, Afghanistan and Kampuchea would be welcome. If
                    the pattern of Soviet conduct changes there may be a basis for mutually
                    beneficial agreements. We are prepared to go either way, I said. I intend to
                    take the same approach in next Monday’s meeting, where regional issues not
                    covered yesterday will surely be a major focus.</p>

                </list>
                <p>Were I <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, I would come away from the
                    first meeting<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2">See <ref target="#d217">Document
                            217</ref>.</note> with the following impressions:</p>
                <p>—The tone and substance of American concerns have not changed.</p>
                <p>—Washington holds Moscow responsible for the sorry state of the relationship.</p>
                <p>—Therefore, changes in American policy toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will not occur absent changes in Soviet behavior.</p>
                <p>—The new Secretary of State professes an interest in making practical progress on
                    specific questions.</p>
                <pb n="732" facs="0763" xml:id="pg_732"/>
                <p>These are all essential messages. However, fundamental questions must still loom
                    in <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s mind.</p>
                <p>—If the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> makes some moves—recognizing that
                    anything more than modest moves are excluded because of the Soviet succession
                    situation—what will the U.S. do?</p>
                <p>—Will it show flexibility and “credit” the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                    for having taken constructive actions, or will it remain rigid and crow about
                    Soviet “retreats” as a way of vindicating and reinforcing a tough line?</p>
                <p>—Does the new Secretary’s concept of progress in certain areas involve movement
                    by <hi rend="italic">both</hi> sides?</p>
                <p>Your aim now should be to help <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                    answer these questions in a way that could lead to improvement in Soviet
                    behavior. In developing an approach to the next meeting, you should have in mind
                    some concept of what would constitute “improvement.”</p>
                <p>I would distinguish five categories:</p>
                <p>1. More cautious future international behavior—i.e., avoidance of <hi rend="italic">new</hi> unhelpful actions.</p>
                <p>2. Steps to ease one or more existing trouble spots.</p>
                <p>3. Actions responsive to our concerns about human rights.</p>
                <p>4. More forthcoming positions in arms control.</p>
                <p>5. Willingness to discuss issues of common concern.</p>
                <p>Bearing in mind the questions <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> may
                    have about what we expect and what the Soviets would get out of being responsive
                    to our concerns, you will want to:</p>
                <p>—be quite <hi rend="italic">concrete</hi> about what we would consider
                    constructive;</p>
                <p>—be as convincing as possible that <hi rend="italic">we will respond
                        positively</hi> (i.e., no crowing and where applicable, flexibility on our
                    side);</p>
                <p>—suggest practical <hi rend="italic">next steps</hi>.</p>
                <p>The following illustrates the approach I have in mind. It identifies what we
                    would regard as constructive Soviet action in each of the five categories.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Refraining from shipping MiGs to Nicaragua</hi>. You have
                    said this would be unacceptable. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                    wants to return to the subject of Central America. You should restate our
                    warning. Obviously, we should not reward the Soviets in any way for avoiding a
                    provocative act in an area of vital interest to us. That said, you may want to
                    find an opportunity to assure <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                    that we will not boast about Moscow having backed down.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Accepting Cuban withdrawal from Angola</hi>. You should
                    press the point that the Soviets will not be able to escape responsibility for
                    frustrating a Namibian settlement if an understanding on Cuban withdrawal cannot
                    be reached. Moscow is unlikely to be helpful if they <pb n="733" facs="0764" xml:id="pg_733"/>suspect the result will be American claims of a Soviet
                    retreat. Indeed, you should say that we would depict it as a constructive step
                    with positive effects on the relationship. What you should not offer is direct
                    Soviet participation in the current diplomatic effort or in shaping the
                    solution, UNTAG, etc. By way of follow-on, you should suggest that <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CCA_1">Crocker</persName> meet soon with Kornyenko and <persName corresp="#p_CCA_1">Crocker</persName>’s counterpart.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Movement on dissidents</hi>. You will not want to get into
                    specific personalities with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, but
                    it’s worth reiterating that letting some people out would have a positive
                    political effect and would not be exploited by us. Without implying a commitment
                    (e.g., that agreement to a <gloss target="#t_CDE_1">CDE</gloss> would be the
                    quid), you should also point out that the prospects for progress in the Madrid
                        <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> talks would climb if some people were
                    let go. As you know, the Soviets have evinced interest in a meeting between Max
                    Kampelman and his counterpart to discuss Madrid. I recommend that you tell
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> we would like to hold this
                    meeting promptly and that we approach it hopefully.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Shifting to more forthcoming positions in arms control</hi>.
                    You do not want the second meeting to dwell on arms control. If it does come up,
                    however, there are two basic points worth making: (1) just as improved Soviet
                    international conduct would improve the prospects for arms control, more
                    forthcoming Soviet positions in arms control would be taken as a sign of
                    Moscow’s desire for progress in the broader relationship; (2) the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will find the US flexible once Soviet
                    positions reflect a genuine interest in significant, verifiable arms reductions.
                    This second point is important because it could help dispel Soviet suspicions
                    that we would simply “pocket” any moves on their part. Bearing in mind how hard
                    it will be to get Washington to change US positions in <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> and INF, you should make this point more
                    as a prediction—and personal view, if you will—than as an offer.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Agreeing to discussions on nuclear non-proliferation</hi>.
                    In view of our clear and common—and, I might add, growing—concern about halting
                    the spread of nuclear weapons, it is logical for us to suggest talks and for the
                    Soviets to agree. Beyond the intrinsic value, the willingness and ability of the
                    two sides to discuss this issue could have a modestly positive political effect
                    on the relationship. There are pitfalls, of course; e.g., the Soviets could use
                    such talks to lambast us on Israel and Pakistan. You should characterize them as
                    “technical” and propose that the Soviets name someone to meet with <persName corresp="#p_KRT_1">Dick Kennedy</persName>. I think it best that we not
                    publicize such talks—at least not yet.</p>
                <p>Again, the basic concept is to zero in on particular possibilities and to
                    convince <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that the US will respond
                    positively to constructive Soviet steps. You may want to be more selective;
                    indeed, the more possibilities you identify the more it may seem to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that we <pb n="734" facs="0765" xml:id="pg_734"/>insist that the Soviet overhaul their whole foreign policy
                    before relations can improve. The counter argument is that the more ideas you
                    lay out the higher the probability that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> will find some bait that interests him. Of those that
                    I’ve identified, Southern Africa and nonproliferation would seem to offer the
                    best prospects for actual results; I recommend you cover at least these.</p>
                <p>I have not mentioned Afghanistan. You should suggest that <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> and Kornyenko have another round of
                    talks; but there should be no connotation that the Soviets are doing us a favor
                    by agreeing—so I wouldn’t cast it as an example of a positive Soviet action.</p>
                <p>Let me suggest that you look at the attached matrix, which displays how to define
                    and address each objective. If this framework appeals to you, we can tailor your
                    opening statement and package your talking points accordingly.</p>

                    a positive measure the second <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> meeting
                    would agree on some topics that the two sides would follow-up in later
                    lower-level confidential, informal meetings. Areas mentioned were nuclear
                    non-proliferation, restrictions on conventional arms sales, chemical weapons,
                    Indian Ocean, and the Nuclear Test Ban. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> emphasized this was a non-inclusive list with the US
                    free to add or subtract from it. End Summary.</p>
                <p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> met at his request
                    on Friday, October 1, with Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName>. He said that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was looking ahead to the upcoming
                    second <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> bilateral<note n="2" xml:id="d220fn2">See <ref target="#d221">Document 221</ref>.</note> and was thinking of what
                    positive results could come of it. “Off the top of his head” there were a few
                    areas where <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> thought something
                    could be done. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> mentioned nuclear
                    non-proliferation; the test ban treaty; the chemical warfare treaty;
                    restrictions on sales of conventional weapons, and the Indian Ocean as some
                    examples.</p>
                <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> emphasized that these were
                    just suggestions and that the Soviets were open-minded and would welcome any
                    other suggestions that we wished to make. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s idea would be that the topics could be briefly
                    discussed in the <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> meeting and agreement reached on which
                    specific areas would be followed up. The follow-up would be done in a
                    confidential, informal way at a lower level: perhaps by the respective Embassies
                    in some instances; on the periphery of international conferences by experts in
                    others, and so on. The method can be worked out; the point is to get agreement
                    on what areas will be pursued.</p>
                <pb n="737" facs="0768" xml:id="pg_737"/>
                <p>3. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> said that
                    a point that bothered him was that all the Soviet suggestions were in the area
                    of arms control. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> hastened to say
                    that these were only rough suggestions and other issues could of course be
                    suggested as well. He said that the Soviets did not expect us to agree to pursue
                    all the Soviet suggestions. We were certainly free to state our objections on
                    any of the topics. They wanted to throw out a variety of ideas for us to choose
                    from.</p>
                <p>4. The meeting ended with an agreement that Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> would discuss the Soviet proposal
                    with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> and get back to
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> with a reply on Sunday night
                    or Monday morning.<note n="3" xml:id="d220fn3">October 3 or 4.</note>

                <p>After brief exchange of pleasantries, <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> said that he would like to
                    continue the exchange of views if there were no objections from the Secretary.
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would like to start with a
                    discussion of the Middle East because the situation there was of interest to
                    both, but he would not attempt to weigh the importance each side attached to
                    this issue. Nevertheless, the question was of great importance and he would like
                    to discuss it.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> replied that indeed the Middle East was an
                    important question. However, the Secretary would like to make a counter
                    suggestion and present a list of five items, which could be discussed in any
                    order, time permitting. But first, he wanted to speak about the general
                    relations between the two powers. The views held by the two sides were not
                    always similar, but he wanted to find a way to improve the U.S.-Soviet
                    relationship by discussing questions of mutual interest and identifying areas
                    where the two sides could constructively work together. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> had already done some preliminary work.</p>
                <p>In this spirit, the Secretary said he would like to present the following
                    list:</p>
                <quote>
                  <p>1. Under a general heading he would like to put the human rights issue on
                        the agenda. This was an issue of great importance to the United States.</p>
                    <p>2. Regional issues. This would be a discussion of preventive measures to be
                        taken, especially in areas of the world where things could get worse.</p>
                    <p>3. Regional trouble spots such as the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>4. Arms reduction, specifically how to make possible headway on a test ban
                        treaty.</p>
                    <p>5. Areas of parallel interest, such as nuclear non-proliferation.</p>

                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> had no
                    objections but, since the question of the Middle East was “in the air” all the
                    time he would start with the Middle East and then discuss the proposed list,
                    noting that other questions might arise during the discussion which might not
                    fit into the Secretary’s suggested framework. However, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> believed that he and the Secretary were
                    not confined to a rigid bureaucratic framework and could discuss any other
                    issues. This, in his view, would be the proper approach. In other words, other
                    questions might be squeezed into the general framework.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> replied that he was ready to give <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> his views on the problems of the Middle
                    East and what to do about them; then he would like to hear <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s views too.</p>
                <p>These were difficult matters to resolve. It would be necessary to find a way to
                    fulfill the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people which <pb n="739" facs="0770" xml:id="pg_739"/>would be fully consistent with the security
                    needs of Israel. The Secretary saw many dimensions to that problem. Many
                    proposals were expressed by the President in his statement on September 1,<note n="2" xml:id="d221fn2">See <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s
                        “Address to the Nation on United States Policy for Peace in the Middle
                        East,” September 1, 1982, <hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                     </hi>, 1982, Vol. II, pp.
                        1093–1097.</note> and if <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> were
                    not familiar with them, the Secretary would be glad to give him a copy. The U.S.
                    side believed that a central problem now was the situation in Lebanon, which was
                    complex and distressing. Lebanon was a country that became an innocent bystander
                    in a larger conflict, plagued from 1975 on by the existence of a state within a
                    state and incapable of governing itself. People got killed, wounded, and
                    displaced. Previous disputes and threats to Israel’s security, especially from
                    the southern part of Lebanon, had lead to present conflict, death and
                    destruction. Now there were problems with the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> evacuation and recently, with the massacre.<note n="3" xml:id="d221fn3">Reference is to the massacre of Palestinians in the Sabra
                        and Shatila camps in the aftermath of the assassination of Bashir Gemayel on
                        September 14.</note> The problem was to get the Syrian, <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> and Israeli forces out of the country and to
                    do everything possible to establish a free and independent government and to
                    start reconstruction of the country. At the same time, there was the parallel
                    need to make progress in the Middle East process. This process would be possible
                    with the cooperation of every party involved, but the heart of the problem was
                    the reconciliation of the people and making the legitimate rights of the
                    Palestinians compatible with the interests of Israel. The President’s speech on
                    September 1 was an effort to advance this process within the framework of the
                    Camp David Accord.</p>
                <p>A related issue was the Iran/Iraq conflict. The U.S. was determined to remain
                    neutral but held the view that the former territorial boundaries were to be
                    respected. The U.S. was for a ceasefire and supported <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Resolutions pertinent to that situation.</p>

                  </hi> replied
                    that there was no need to say more about U.S. and Soviet interests in the Middle
                    East. It was sufficient to look at the map to see that this whole region was
                    adjacent to the Soviet Union and any situation in that region was of no little
                    concern to the Soviet Union from the point of view of security. The Secretary
                    should not think that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was
                    regarding this matter from a distance. Over a number of years the Soviet Union
                    was aware of an American attempt to ease the Soviet Union out of any
                    participation leading to a solution to the Middle East problem. No one should
                    believe that the Soviet Union could be left out of the Middle East solution. One
                    must proceed from the premise that neither the U.S. nor the Soviet Union can be
                    excluded from an examination of Middle East problems. If anyone <pb n="740" facs="0771" xml:id="pg_740"/>suggested that the Soviet Union could simply be
                    crossed out when talking about the Middle East, the Secretary should not heed
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> continued to say that the U.S.
                    should not fear Soviet participation in a Middle East settlement. He stressed
                    that the Soviet Union was in favor of the existence of Israel as a state because
                    many years ago Washington and Moscow proposed simultaneously that Israel should
                    be established as an independent state while it was still under British mandate.
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> recalled that in 1947 he was
                    heading the Soviet delegation to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> where he
                    never wavered through the difficult negotiations and stood fast before extremist
                    Arab factions who did not want Israel to exist. Neither Israel nor the U.S.
                    should fear the presence of the Soviet Union in that area. Why not sit down
                    together, think together and perhaps do something together to bring about a real
                    settlement? What has happened in the Mideast was not in accordance with plans
                    and intentions of those who wanted to establish an independent Arab/Palestinian
                    along with an independent Jewish state. The Soviet Union wanted Israel to be a
                    normal peace-loving state and not an aggressive one. The Soviet Union was not
                    worried about Israel as a state, but about the direction of its policy. Israel
                    seemed to see aggression as the way of its future expansion. To justify their
                    actions the Israelis referred to the Bible, invoked ancient history but forgot
                    that the Bible dealt with different times and that these references might not
                    benefit Israel in the long run. He added that the Soviet Union wanted Israel to
                    exist and to live in peace and maintain normal relations with Arab countries. He
                    knew that the Arabs wanted peace with Israel—he was not talking about Arab
                    extremists which he mentioned earlier, but recent acts perpetrated by Israel
                    caused dismay, indignation and even anger among the people of the Soviet Union.
                    It was not long ago that the Soviet people had saved European Jews from
                    annihilation at the hands of Hitler’s invaders. Now the whole world could see
                    the Jews assuming some characteristics of Nazi Germany. At the same time,
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would not be afraid to look
                    for a common language and for a role for the Soviet Union to resolve the
                    problem. What Israel had recently perpetrated had to be corrected—the dead could
                    not be resurrected but at least Israeli forces should be withdrawn from the
                    occupied areas. He could not be sure that the Israelis would not do something
                    similar or worse and start a chain of events that neither the Secretary nor
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would want to see.</p>
                <p>In view of the above, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted the
                    Secretary to take a broad view of the situation, a view from a high tower to get
                    things into perspective. The Soviet point of view on the Camp David Accords was
                    well known. A broader view of the situation should be taken. The area is a
                    “warehouse of explosives”. No one wanted such a development—neither the Soviet
                    Union nor the United States, nor any other country.</p>
                <pb n="741" facs="0772" xml:id="pg_741"/>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> then turned to the Fez meeting.
                    The Fez principles were reasonable and could be the basis of a settlement, and
                    were not in opposition to certain Soviet principles. As for Washington’s plans
                    and the statements by the President, the most acute problem of the area was not
                    mentioned, namely—an autonomous Palestinian state. How viable could such a plan
                    be? Such a plan would not work, was not realistic and could not be implemented.
                    A plan that would not provide for a Palestinian state and also for an
                    independent state of Israel was not viable.</p>
                <p>As for the procedural or organizational aspects, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that the Arab proposal to raise the issue in the
                    Security Council was acceptable to him, even if Washington did not like it, and
                    any other Arab state could participate in it. What was needed was a qualified
                    vote in the Security Council. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                    idea was that in spite of the proceedings in the Security Council, the United
                    States, the Soviet Union and some Arab states could seek in parallel an
                    effective solution of the problem. What he had in mind was a conference of
                    countries such as Israel, Syria, Jordan, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and
                    perhaps some other countries wishing to participate. This would not be an
                    attempt to create a mini-General Assembly. There would be no imposition by
                    majority vote in such a conference, which would be a fresh forum where new ideas
                    to reach an agreement could be tried. It was not by chance that after WW II some
                    peace conferences were held with interested countries. In his view, Arab
                    countries would be willing to recognize Israel—after a withdrawal of Israeli
                    forces from occupied Arab lands, but Israel would feel safer too. Would the U.S.
                    be willing to guarantee such an arrangement? Perhaps the Soviet Union and other
                    countries would do it too. This was no “evil eye” that the U.S. need fear.
                    Perhaps if Washington would cast a fresh glance at the issue, some people there
                    might be willing to think about it.</p>
                <p>No matter what, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> continued, the end
                    of military action in the area would not be the end of the problem. Problems
                    would continue. Today, Israel was powerful, but would Israel want to remain at
                    war for the next 100 years? Would Israel be equally strong in say, 10, 15 or 20
                    years?</p>

               </quote>
                <p>Currently, the problem was how to deal with Israeli, Syrian and <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> forces. The U.S. was using its persuasive
                    powers to get the Israelis <pb n="742" facs="0773" xml:id="pg_742"/>to withdraw
                    their forces. The current withdrawal from all of Beirut and from the airport was
                    a “downpayment.” At the same time, the U.S. was talking to the Syrians though
                    there was no direct way to talk with the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>.
                    The Soviet Union had provided the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> with
                    Soviet weapons; therefore, the influence that the Soviet Union had with the
                        <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> and the Syrians could be used
                    constructively to encourage their withdrawal from Lebanon. Meanwhile, the U.S.
                    would put up funds for humanitarian purposes and for the reconstruction of
                    Lebanon. Government funds would be needed to rebuild the infrastructure, such as
                    roads, etc., while private capital could be attracted to Lebanon for other forms
                    of development. In other words, a stable climate was needed to attract capital.
                    The Soviet Union could help persuade the Syrians and the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> to leave Lebanon so that reconstruction could
                    begin. In this regard, the Secretary noted disturbing reports that armed
                    Palestinians had returned to northern Lebanon.</p>

                    in northern Lebanon, according to reliable information. Those from Beirut were
                    returning to that area. <hi rend="italic">

                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> then turned to the Palestinian issue, noting
                    that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had charged that President
                        <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> had bypassed the issue of a
                    Palestinian state. The Secretary explained that the President had examined this
                    idea, but had specifically rejected it. He believed it more promising to have a
                    Palestinian affiliation with Jordan; such a plan was more workable. The
                    Secretary remembered travelling through the area a few years ago and found it
                    rather barren. It was difficult for the Secretary to imagine how it could work
                    as an independent entity. The President also believed that an independent
                    sovereign state with its own independent armed forces and the ability to use
                    these forces would be a destabilizing factor in that area. He believed that
                    fewer not more arms were needed there. According to the President’s plan, this
                    would be a territory to be governed together with Jordan; it would be a
                    demilitarized area that Israel would not have to worry about.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> remembered travelling to Israel right after
                    Sadat’s visit to Jerusalem and he felt that the natural disposition of the
                    Israelis was to have peace in the area. He pointed out that the Israelis were
                    willing to give up the Sinai desert to achieve peace. At any rate, the Camp
                    David forum did prove successful in establishing peaceful relations between
                    Israel and Egypt. In other words, the Camp David Accords were an effective
                    framework and no different forum was <pb n="743" facs="0774" xml:id="pg_743"/>needed now, only the emergence of the willingness on the part of the Arab
                    leaders, King Hussein, West Bank Palestinians and others to help resolve an
                    issue between the Palestinian people and Israel. The Secretary noted that Camp
                    David contained explicit mention of legitimate Palestinian rights and talked of
                    “self-governing” authority for the West Bank. Thus, the basics were up to
                    Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinians to work out.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> replied
                    that Camp David provided for self-government for the Palestinians, which meant
                    that they could vote on the West Bank and in Gaza for this or that Mayor or
                    perhaps a sheriff. But, he added with a smile, the basic issue was the creation
                    of an independent and autonomous state. He believed that the concept of
                    self-government suffered from too many different interpretations. It was one
                    thing to live in your own house, but something else to be able to vote for
                    mayor, a judge, or a policeman. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                    then asked whether if the Syrians leave, will the Israelis pull out? He then
                    quickly said that he didn’t know Syrian plans, and that he had not discussed it
                    with the Syrians and somebody would have to talk to the Syrians about it because
                    these were Syrian troops that they were talking about. He asked the Secretary to
                    give him his clear view on the issue because he only wanted a better
                    understanding of the problem and that the Secretary should not draw any
                    conclusions from the question.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> said that perhaps they had found something
                    they could agree on noting that certain words have a certain meaning and
                    connotation in the Middle East. As for self-determination, the U.S. was in favor
                    of it. As for self-government, the U.S. envisioned more than just voting for
                    your own sheriff. The issue was the environment: social and economic life and
                    the ability to control these factors. That’s how the President’s plan would
                    work. This would not include a military establishment, which would be
                    destabilizing in that area. The thinking was that the territory in question
                    could be best set up in association with Jordan. Such an arrangement would give
                    better economic scope to the Palestinians.</p>
                <p>As for <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> fighters in north Lebanon, the
                    Secretary continued, the evidence of their presence there was clear. In time,
                    they might lay down arms and become part of the population, but that was not
                    clear. As for Israeli intentions concerning withdrawal, the Secretary himself
                    had put that question to Foreign Minister Shamir, who had said, once the Syrians
                    were out, that Israel would leave all of Lebanon and not occupy any part of it.
                    The President would hold Israel to its word. The U.S. would hope that conditions
                    could be created to allow this to happen before the end of the year. But the
                    Secretary noted that it was important to recognize how the current situation
                    came about. Southern Lebanon was an area with many <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> fighters who harassed Israelis <pb n="744" facs="0775" xml:id="pg_744"/>in the northern part of the country. This constituted a
                    base against northern Israel. This was the reason why the Israelis moved into
                    Lebanon. Israel needed an assurance, as the role that UNIFIL<note n="4" xml:id="d221fn4">Reference is to the United Nations Interim Force in
                        Lebanon.</note> is meant to play has shown, that this area would not again
                    be used to harass Israel. Some kind of security arrangements, like UNIFIL, would
                    be necessary. In short, the answer to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s question, was a “pretty good yes,” the U.S. intention
                    was to push hard to make the Israelis pull out of Lebanon and to do it promptly
                    before they had a chance to settle in.</p>
                <p>

                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> then asked
                    the Secretary whether it would be useful to agree on some basic consultations
                    between the U.S. and Soviet representatives at some agreed level to discuss the
                    Middle East. There would be no time frame at this point, but <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would propose about one month to
                    establish such an exchange and asked whether the Secretary would agree to it or
                    whether such an approach was taboo.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> replied that he and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> were exchanging views on the Middle
                    East right now and there was no reason why this should not be continued. Perhaps
                    such meetings could take place in Moscow or in Washington. The U.S. had a very
                    good Ambassador and so did the Soviet Union and such an exchange of views could
                    be set up periodically, whenever something of importance had to be discussed.
                    The Secretary felt that since the Soviet Ambassador could see many people in
                    Washington, he would hope that <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName>
                    could see <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and others when
                    necessary. He concluded that, having such outstanding Ambassadors, we should let
                    them handle such exchanges.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> replied
                    that if the Secretary was uneasy about a special exchange of views, there was no
                    need for it, and both sides could agree through their Ambassadors to conduct
                    such exchanges, perhaps on a rotating basis. When necessary and the sides were
                    agreeable, some special talks might also be arranged. In summary, the Soviet
                    Union wanted peace in the Middle East without diminishing lawful interests of
                    Israel in defending its right to exist, but was strictly against Israel’s
                    aggressive policy and the trend towards annexation. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> could not be shut out of Middle East
                    diplomacy. He assured the Secretary that the Soviet side would be ready for an
                    exchange of views.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> wanted to raise a question related to a
                    different part of the Middle East, namely the Iran/Iraq conflict, which had
                    turned into a substantial war. This conflict seemed to be rooted in Shiite
                    fundamentalism that was spreading through the region and could spill over into
                    other areas. The U.S. was determined to remain neutral and had called for a
                    ceasefire and the observance of national boundaries. The U.S. was not supplying
                    arms to either side. However, that war <pb n="745" facs="0776" xml:id="pg_745"/>remained a matter of concern to the United States, and we would like to hear
                    Soviet views.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> replied
                    that the Soviet Union maintained contacts with Iraq, but less so with Iran
                    because of the complex situation there. The Soviet Union considered the current
                    Iran-Iraq conflict to be an absurd war for both countries and that it was time
                    to end it. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> could not understand
                    why it started in the first place. It would be helpful if the U.S. would act
                    similarly and advise Iraq and “your old bosom friend Iran” to put an end to it.
                    However, as he saw it, it would be a gross miscalculation on the part of the
                    United States if, with reference to the danger from Iran, the U.S. decided to
                    install military facilities in an Arab country adjacent to it. There was no need
                    to do it, such a move would only make matters worse.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> replied that the Persian Gulf was of vital
                    importance to the United States and that any spillover of the fundamentalist
                    movement, as recently seen in the coup attempt in Bahrain, would have grave
                    consequences. The U.S. was concerned not only about Iran or Iraq, but also about
                    the possibility of a spillover into Bahrain, Kuwait, or Saudi Arabia. The U.S.
                    would have to look to its interests. The Secretary took note of <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement, but wanted him to know how
                    important the Gulf was to the United States.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> then turned to the matter of human rights,
                    which was at the very top of his list and a matter of great concern in the
                    United States. On his way to the meeting, the Secretary was handed a paper by
                    some New York Congressmen;<note n="5" xml:id="d221fn5">Not further
                        identified.</note> he hadn’t looked at it yet but it probably dealt with
                    emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union. He remembered that when he was in the
                    Nixon administration, he had a quiet exchange with the Soviet side concerning an
                    increase in emigrants from the Soviet Union. An increase came about and this was
                    welcomed. We would welcome some information about the 15 names on the list which
                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> handed to <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName> after the first meeting. These were
                    persons claiming U.S. citizenship who wanted to return to the United States;
                    most of them were elderly, and one had been trying to emigrate since 1947. This
                    was a long time. Resolution of questions such as these would do much to improve
                    U.S.-Soviet relations. Little things in this area, he added, could make a big
                    difference.</p>
                <p>The Secretary said that he and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                    should discuss such matters quietly in order to improve U.S./Soviet relations.
                    Shcharansky was another case to be discussed. His wife was planning to
                    demonstrate in front of the Soviet Embassy; he was a sick man and cases of this
                        <pb n="746" facs="0777" xml:id="pg_746"/>nature were bound to catch
                    attention in the United States. When discussing arms reductions earlier on, the
                    Secretary had touched on the Helsinki Final Act and activities on the part of
                    the Soviet Union which appeared not to be in accord with the provision of that
                    agreement. The Secretary wanted to point out very emphatically, without engaging
                    in polemics, that little things could make a big difference in mutual relations.
                    The U.S. would welcome discussions to ease existing strains. There were ways of
                    doing it without interfering in the domestic affairs of the Soviet Union and
                    some thought should be given to how to bring it about.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> replied
                    that the deterioration of relations had created an atmosphere that was less
                    conducive to resolving emigration problems from the Soviet Union for certain
                    people. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> felt that U.S. policy was
                    entirely responsible. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> quickly
                    added that he was not going to engage in polemics either, but that somehow they
                    got into the discussion. As for the list received from the U.S., concerning
                    people who were claiming to be U.S. citizens, the Soviets believed them to be
                    Soviet citizens. But he was ready to look at them to determine whether or not
                    they could be classified as U.S. citizens. This could be done objectively and he
                    was prepared to look into this matter. The other list definitely dealt with
                    Soviet citizens wishing to go to Israel and not to the United States. The Soviet
                    Union could not look at such a request. These were not people wishing to go to
                    the United States, but to Israel, and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to be clear that the treatment of such a category
                    of people cannot be revised. He remembered that the Secretary kept referring to
                    the Helsinki Final Act. A government should, if possible, benevolently review
                    such cases, and act benevolently, if possible. It also was the absolute
                    sovereign right of a state to make the final decision. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> remembered the Secretary’s statement
                    that an individual should have the last word. There was no super-national
                    authority which could make these decisions. It was the sovereign state that
                    would make the final decision. No other position was possible. The last word
                    belonged to the state. There was no scope for a collision of views if an
                    objective view were taken.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> returned to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement that the last word belonged to the state.
                    This wasn’t right; the last word belonged to the individual wishing to emigrate.
                    In the U.S. view it was very important for an individual to have the capacity to
                    express himself. On the scale of values, this principle stood very high. The
                    individual should have the last word regardless of where he or she lived. If
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had nothing to add to this
                    subject, perhaps U.S. and Soviet representatives at the Madrid meeting could
                    meet to discuss this issue.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> stated that
                    the last word was not with the individual. There were cases where an individual
                    was engaged in secret or top <pb n="747" facs="0778" xml:id="pg_747"/>secret
                    work. Every state had the right not to allow such people to leave the country.
                    This was an inalienable right of the state. (<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> repeated inalienable right in English.) The Soviet Union
                    had the right to do it. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                    remembered cases where an individual was held back, but then after awhile was
                    allowed to depart. The last word was not with the individual, he repeated.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> replied that much depended on each
                    individual case. The above conditions did not affect many people. An individual
                    had rights over his life and for the most part could come and go as he wished.
                    The U.S. did not have the problem that the Soviets faced. The Secretary
                    remembered a slogan he saw abroad “Yankee go home and take me with you.” He
                    added that the annual in-flow of people into the United States from all over the
                    world was considerable. As for the 15 individuals involved, he did not think
                    they were involved in top secret work and if U.S.-Soviet relations were to
                    improve, such cases would have to be handled differently. Any positive action
                    taken by the Soviet Union would improve the atmosphere that had gotten worse, as
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had noted earlier.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> admitted
                    that there was only a small percentage of people involved in secret work who
                    wanted to leave. He pointed out that many people were allowed to leave the
                    Soviet Union during the last few years. <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                  </hi> added that the number was
                    well over 100,000. <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> continued to say that <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> seemed to believe that many Soviet
                    people wanted to leave, but very often these were people who are making much
                    noise about it, had the time to write and in general were making a nuisance of
                    themselves. There were even cases where a person was said by the U.S. to be
                    anxious to leave, but when asked, the answer was “no, I don’t want to leave,
                    only my relatives abroad want me to come”. (<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> instructed his interpreter to render the above passage
                    “with feeling”.)</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> then mentioned the case of Professor
                    McClellan’s wife, who had been waiting for eight years to come to the U.S. <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> said he
                    was unfamiliar with the case, but promised to look into it and <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>
                  </hi> added that he
                    was familiar with the case. <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> asked whether
                    the two <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> negotiators would want to meet
                    and discuss these issues. Ambassador Kampelman would be ready to discuss these
                    matters.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> said that
                    these questions did not require a special meeting, but that he would support the
                    idea of having a meeting to discuss the Madrid <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> sessions and he was sure that, if Kampelman raised human
                    rights questions, the Soviet representative would be prepared to listen. At the
                    same time, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to avail
                    himself of the opportunity to object vehemently to an unusual move by the U.S.
                    side which must have been sanctioned at the very top. The Soviet <pb n="748" facs="0779" xml:id="pg_748"/>Representative, Kovalev while in Madrid, had
                    agreed to meet with Kampelman in Vienna. Upon arrival in Vienna, he discovered
                    that Kampelman had not come. In all his experience in diplomatic affairs,
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had never encountered such
                    unacceptable behavior by a diplomat. He felt that in the future, he might have
                    to send diplomatic notes to arrange similar meetings. He asked the Secretary to
                    straighten this matter out, but in principle he was ready to conduct such talks
                    at any time and at any place.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> replied that confusion about the meeting was
                    due to a third party trying to arrange it. Austria undertook to arrange this
                    meeting, but something went wrong. He assured <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that this matter would be worked out through the two
                    Ambassadors. <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> suggested that the U.S. representative should
                    travel to Moscow on such an occasion, since his Soviet counterpart had already
                    done his foreign travel. <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> replied that the
                    venue and the time could be discussed by the Ambassadors. <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> agreed.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> then suggested that the discussion
                    move on to regional topics such as Afghanistan, the Caribbean and Africa.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> started by saying that Afghanistan
                    had already been discussed with the Secretary’s predecessor and that he would
                    like to only mention two aspects of the Afghanistan problem. First, there was
                    the domestic issue concerning the regime, the leadership, the competence of the
                    regime, its legal system and so on. Nobody had any right to interfere in these
                    internal affairs of Afghanistan. Then there was the external aspect. <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> interjected that, before moving on to
                    external affairs, he wanted to point out that Soviet troops were currently
                    stationed in Afghanistan. <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> promised to take up that issue and continued to
                    explain his view of the situation. On the external situation, armed incursions
                    from Pakistan were taking place, and these gangs were trained mainly in Pakistan
                    and partly in Iran. They engaged in acts of terrorism such as shooting teachers
                    and children, and young men were forced to join these gangs. These incursions
                    from outside amounted to a foreign aggression which was the main reason why the
                    Afghan leadership asked the Soviet Union for assistance. This was a security
                    issue in Afghanistan and, at the Afghan request, the Soviet Union had sent a
                    limited number of Soviet troops. This was because the incursions from Pakistan
                    were fighting the existing regime and government.</p>
                <p>As for the presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted the Secretary to hear from a representative of
                    the Soviet Union that, as soon as these armed outside elements stopped fighting
                    the present government, Soviet troops would be pulled out. There must be an
                    effective and guaranteed end to such incursions. How could this be subject to
                    negotiations. A pullout would be a part of an understand<pb n="749" facs="0780" xml:id="pg_749"/>ing between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. “We went in,
                    and we will pull out when the Afghan leadership agrees”. Afghanistan would have
                    to be an independent and non-aligned country. This was being said in the
                    corridors of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. Why not support it? Why
                    would such a position be unacceptable to the West and to Pakistan? The armed
                    bands did not come from the moon, but from Pakistan where they were trained and
                    armed. On the question of refugees, real refugees could return to Afghanistan
                    without any difficulty, and there were special laws dealing with such refugees.
                    There was, of course, a small group of formerly privileged people from
                    Afghanistan who would have to seek refuge elsewhere. Lastly, meetings to be held
                    in Geneva through the good offices of the Personal Representative of the
                    Secretary-General, between Afghan and Pakistani representatives, would have
                    Soviet support. The U.S. had good relations with Pakistan and the Soviet Union
                    was not against Pakistan; it was only concerned that Pakistan was a base for
                    incursions into Afghanistan. Afghanistan also wanted to improve relations with
                    Pakistan, and they had some border questions to discuss. They should talk—that
                    was the Soviet position. An improvement of the situation in that region also
                    would help U.S.-Soviet relations. The Soviet Union found it impossible to
                    maintain any other position. “This is a door to the Soviet Union, this is a
                    neighboring border state. That’s what it is.”</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> replied that his view of the diplomatic and
                    military history differed sharply from <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s. Men were fighting in Afghanistan because armed forces
                    of another country were dominating the government in Afghanistan. There were
                    incursions because foreign forces were stationed in Afghanistan and tried to
                    control that country. The Secretary also wanted to add a phrase to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s proposal for an independent and
                    non-aligned Afghanistan. The phrase would be, “a government freely chosen by the
                    Afghan people.” The presence of foreign troops in that country would make free
                    choice impossible. The removal of Soviet occupation was the key to the question.
                    The Secretary was glad to hear that there would be talks in Geneva and he hoped
                    that a resolution would also positively affect U.S.-Soviet relations. He added
                    that in the past, the Afghan government had not looked ideal to the U.S. and it
                    was friendly to the Soviet Union; but the U.S. did not object. Now the U.S. and
                    many countries at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> objected to the
                    presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan and believed that fighting in that
                    country was also bad for the Soviet Union. He also mentioned that the recent
                    talks between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> and the
                    Soviet representative in Moscow had not been productive. Another round could
                    take place and the U.S. side was ready to continue such discussions. The
                    Secretary concluded that his views on the history of that country differed from
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s, but that the U.S. would
                    welcome any positive outcome of the talks in Geneva.</p>
                <pb n="750" facs="0781" xml:id="pg_750"/>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> agreed that
                    their assessment of the history and of the actual situation in Afghanistan was
                    different. He too would like to see progress in Geneva and if the U.S. could
                    take a positive view, this could occur.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> then proposed to discuss the Caribbean area,
                    including Central America. The buildup of arms in Nicaragua was far beyond its
                    needs and the flow of arms to other Central American states was disruptive to
                    the stability of that region. Elections had been held in El Salvador showing a
                    very high turn-out by the population in spite of efforts by armed guerrillas to
                    stop people from participating. That country needed stability which would then
                    lead to economic development. It needed a chance. The problem in Central America
                    was to foster economic development, which the U.S. supported, but now such
                    development was hindered by armed intervention, through channels leading through
                    Nicaragua, and by arms deliveries from Cuba and other countries. However, the
                    origin of these arms was the Soviet Union. In particular, as the Secretary had
                    mentioned last week, the emergence of jet fighters, or for that matter, armed
                    Cuban forces in Nicaragua was unacceptable to the United States. Nations of
                    Central America wanted stability and were willing to work with the United
                    States. The massive buildup of arms was disruptive and causing a great deal of
                    concern to the United States. Cuba appeared to be involved in that area and so
                    was the Soviet Union by delivering arms. Because of Soviet involvement we were
                    interested in <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s view.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> replied
                    that his country was watching the Caribbean area and Central America and agreed
                    that at times this was an unquiet, even tense part of the world. But the
                    tensions were not generated by Cuba and very little Nicaragua; these were little
                    Latin American countries facing the United States, which was a big country.
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> could not agree that these
                    forces could be disruptive, but he knew of U.S. accusations leveled at Cuba.
                    Also, Nicaragua seemed to be appearing more and more frequently in the
                    Washington lexicon. The notion that Cuba or Nicaragua was a danger to the United
                    States could not be taken seriously. No world leader could seriously believe
                    such accusations. In fact, all this was unbelievable. Cuba did have some Soviet
                    arms, but not much because Cuba cannot afford much. There were minimal amounts
                    of weapons sent to Nicaragua for its own security purposes. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> felt that U.S. information was not very
                    good and that some of the accusations could not be treated seriously. Business
                    was bad for U.S. foreign policy in El Salvador, he continued, but not because of
                    Cuba and Nicaragua; rather, it was because of the way the people of that country
                    lived. There were some groups of people there—<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was sure that the Secretary would understand his
                    thoughts without going into detail. As for Nicaragua, this was a new country <pb n="751" facs="0782" xml:id="pg_751"/>to the Soviet Union, but it was of no
                    danger to the United States and had no evil intentions towards the United
                    States. He assured the Secretary that the U.S. could sleep peacefully because no
                    problems would come her way from these quarters. The idea that Soviet influence
                    and Soviet arms in that area presented a danger to the U.S. could not be taken
                    seriously. The Soviet Union would need a very long arm to reach that area, and
                    it had no plans and no desire to do so. The Soviet Union wanted Cuba and
                    Nicaragua to have good relations with the United States, and they in turn wanted
                    to establish good relations with the United States. However, the U.S. responded
                    to these overtures by a blockade, ostracism and isolation. Was this good for
                    U.S. policy? Everyone had the right to feel sympathy or antipathy towards
                    somebody. Even during the American Revolution, people had different sympathies.
                    It would be best for the U.S. to remain calm, but instead the U.S. was about to
                    start a radio propaganda war against Cuba. The Soviet Union felt that this was
                    unnecessary, that it would be better for the U.S. to remain cool in evaluating
                    the situation. As a big country, the U.S. could inject a calming and moderating
                    influence into that region and cool hot tempers. The U.S. as a big power could
                    afford to do it without any harm to its foreign policy and prestige.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> replied that he was very disappointed in
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s response. It was ridiculous
                    to think that the U.S. was trying to stir-up problems in that area. The problem
                    was that arms were flowing from Nicaragua down to Costa Rica, Honduras and other
                    countries. This flow of arms and of military advisers should be stopped to give
                    these countries a chance for stability and for development. Without going into
                    detail, the Secretary found the situation in the area very troublesome, but the
                    U.S. was ready to defend its interests there.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> replied
                    that he had heard a similar approach from the Secretary’s predecessor, namely
                    that Nicaragua was receiving a flow of arms, of Cuban advisors, etc. He tried to
                    verify this information by checking with the Cubans and found that <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>’s information was incorrect, to put it
                    mildly. There were Cuban teachers and medical personnel, but there were no
                    military advisers. The idea that Cuba had plans to interfere in Nicaragua was
                    simply hard to believe. He said that the Soviet Union had enjoyed good relations
                    with Cuba for a number of years. Nicaragua was a new country to the Soviet
                    Union, but the Soviet Union felt sympathy for the Nicaraguan people. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was sure that the Secretary knew the
                    clique, or whatever he wished to call them, who were earlier in power in that
                    country. He wanted to stress again that the stories about military advisers and
                    other schemes and plans in that area were pure inventions. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was not saying this to give the
                    Secretary a false feeling of security. The Soviet Union was not that naive.</p>
                <pb n="752" facs="0783" xml:id="pg_752"/>
                <p>The Secretary said he was glad to hear <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s assurances, but the information available to him
                    pointed to large volumes of arms, with indications of where they were going.
                    There was no doubt about it and there were also groups disruptive of existing
                    governments. This was a very unpleasant and unacceptable situation. He did not
                    know what the Cubans told <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> said there
                    were some people from Cuba in Nicaragua, but they were medical personnel and
                    teachers, and not military people as the Secretary had implied. <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> said that even if it were as <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> had said, the presence of combat troops
                    or jet planes would be unacceptable. <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> asked for confirmation that
                    the Secretary had said “jet planes,” and <hi rend="italic">both
                        interpreters</hi> confirmed that he had. <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> then asked if this statement
                    referred to a present or a hypothetical situation. (The Secretary did not
                    respond directly to this question.)</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> then turned to Africa, saying that he hoped
                    that perhaps something constructive could be done. <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> replied that what was needed,
                    first of all, was an independent Namibian state. South Africa had no right to be
                    there, it contradicted certain <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Resolutions.
                    Second, South Africa also would have to stop aggression against Angola,
                    especially using Namibian territory. The whole world could see the raids and
                    aggression by South Africa. Third, aid to some groups such as <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>, in Angola, which fight against the
                    present government, would have to stop. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> knew that there were Cuban troops in Angola. This was a
                    situation analogous to Afghanistan because the presence of Cuban troops in
                    Angola was not the cause but the effect of South African aggression. If these
                    causes were removed, then Cuban troops would also be removed. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that he and the Secretary had
                    talked to the Angolans, and both knew their position. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> knew what the Angolans thought about
                    the region and what they thought about Cuban troops. There was a joint statement
                    by Angola and Cuba early this year on that subject. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> thought that earlier the U.S. had been interested in
                    talking to the Soviet Union about this issue. However, lately he had noticed a
                    certain waning of interest on the part of the U.S. The Soviet Union was ready to
                    keep up contacts with other countries trying to resolve the Angolan question
                    without interfering in its internal affairs. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_CCA_1">Crocker</persName>’s meeting with Soviet representatives was only
                    informative. As for the Group of Five any U.S.-Soviet talks had nothing to do
                    with the creation of the Group of Five; they sort of formed themselves. He
                    believed that the relevant <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Resolutions would
                    be a good basis for a general solution. He was sure that more contacts were
                    needed between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and also some other countries, to
                    resolve the issue.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> welcomed the statement about contacts. As
                    for the Contact Group, he said that their work was in line with <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> interests <pb n="753" facs="0784" xml:id="pg_753"/>and that they were attempting to bring about independence
                    and free elections in Namibia. These were complicated talks involving South
                    Africa, but they seemed to be going fairly well. At this point, there was no
                    certainty of having an election with <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                    presence. The impediment now was the lack of operational plans for the
                    withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola connected to the South African pullout
                    from Namibia. More was needed than just general statements. A program for
                    assurances was needed that provided for Cuban troop withdrawal if Namibia gained
                    independence. Without such assurances, little could be done. Even if it were not
                    connected with talks about Namibian independence, some parallel action was still
                    needed. The hurdle remained: how would Cubans leave Angola? The U.S. side was
                    working to resolve this issue, and the Secretary hoped that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would also use his influence to bring
                    about a solution. The Secretary said that this might be an area where the two
                    powers could do something constructive together. He repeated that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> had influence and that the U.S. was willing
                    to cooperate. The neighboring states also wanted to see an independent Namibia.
                    The Secretary thought it possible to have parallel efforts in this direction. He
                    agreed that the meeting between <persName corresp="#p_CCA_1">Crocker</persName>
                    and the Soviet representative was mainly informative. As for additional points
                    of contact suggested by <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, the
                    Secretary thought that <persName corresp="#p_CCA_1">Crocker</persName> and
                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> should arrange for
                    another meeting to share ideas and see whether some parallel actions could be
                    taken as initiated. He wanted to include Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> because he was familiar with the subject and could play
                    an important role if events should take a more constructive turn.</p>
                <p>As for Angola, the Secretary believed that this nation needed a national
                    reconciliation but that the Angolans would have to work this out themselves. The
                    presence of foreign forces was a burden to the local economy; at a time when the
                    Angolans needed development, the less they spent on arms, the more would be left
                    for development.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> suggested
                    that representatives from each side should agree on the date and place for
                    consultations and do this roughly within a month or a month-and-a-half. In
                    essence, the Soviet Union wanted to see this matter resolved, and he knew that
                    Angola and Cuba also wanted a resolution, but on a just basis. This would
                    involve an independent Namibia, no aid to those against the present Angolan
                    regime, and no South African aggression against Angola. As for Cuban troops, if
                    the above could be resolved, then it would not be difficult for Angola and Cuba
                    to resolve the rest. As for the Contact Group, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was
                    not bound by it. The Soviet Union and the U.S. should consult bilaterally and
                    then inform others later of the results. <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi>
                    said that he did not object to this proposal. He would be prepared to have a
                    meeting within a month and would leave it up to <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CCA_1">Crocker</persName> to
                    decide on the time and the place.</p>

                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> then moved
                    on to nuclear non-proliferation. He wanted the Secretary to know that the Soviet
                    Union was an unconditional supporter of the non-proliferation treaty. More work
                    by the Soviet Union and the U.S. was necessary to widen the circle of
                    participants because not as many countries had joined as had been envisaged, and
                    it was necessary to watch this agreement very closely because there were
                    loopholes in it. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was glad that
                    the Secretary was showing interest in this matter. It had come to his attention
                    that there were certain circles in the United States advocating other ways of
                    resolving the problem without supporting the original agreement. He did not want
                    to believe it, and he was glad to hear that that was but a rumor. If the U.S.
                    was firmly supporting the non-proliferation agreement and its provisions, the
                    Soviet Union would act accordingly.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> said that the U.S. was ready to subscribe to
                    these principles and also felt genuine concern about necessary vigilance and the
                    need to close any loopholes in the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. He also
                    assured <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> of continuing U.S.
                    support for the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss>, but had to register his
                    distress over the vote on Israel. He was against the politicizing of this group.
                    He was distressed at what had happened in Vienna recently. This agency was very
                    valuable and should not be politicized. As for contacts on non-proliferation
                    issues, the Secretary informed <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                    that the U.S. had recently appointed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRT_1">Richard
                        Kennedy</persName> to deal with these matters full-time. The Secretary said
                    that it might be constructive to have meetings in Washington or Moscow or in
                    some other place to establish a quiet pattern of work in this area. He believed
                    that the interests of the two powers were close on this issue, so constructive
                    work should be possible.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi> thought it
                    possible for the representatives to meet and to look at the strict
                    implementation of the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>. The date and place
                    could be arranged later. <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> added that their
                    Ambassadors could be helpful in such an endeavor.</p>
                <p>In summing up, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that the two
                    parties had discussed issues from the top downwards. He wanted to close on a
                    note stressed by <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> and himself at
                    the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>—that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would like normal relations with the United States, but on the
                    basis of respect for its legitimate interests. Nobody should be allowed to
                    disturb the balance in the world and therefore the sides started with <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> and INF in Europe, questions of
                    exceptional importance. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was sure
                    that the U.S. was familiar with Soviet proposals presented early on and during
                    the present <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> session. He wanted to stress
                    statements made by the Soviet Union in a unilateral way about no-first-use of
                    nuclear weapons and hoped that the U.S. would act in a similar manner. He would
                    not expect an answer at this point, but since the U.S. was familiar with the
                    Soviet position, he would ask the Secretary to study it without bias or
                    prejudice.</p>
                <pb n="755" facs="0786" xml:id="pg_755"/>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> wanted to make a few comments in a similar
                    spirit. As for the last question, the Secretary pointed out that no-first-use of
                    any kind of weapon was a posture maintained by <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and by the U.S. This meant no aggression with any weapon. This
                    matter should be looked at in a comprehensive manner. As for arms reductions,
                    the Secretary knew of the professional attitude and the businesslike manner in
                    which the negotiatiors were working in Geneva and this applied to both U.S. and
                    Soviet negotiators. The Secretary mentioned this in his <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> speech<note n="6" xml:id="d221fn6">
                     <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>’s September 30 speech is printed in
                        the Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, November 1982, pp.
                        1–9.</note> and, although many issues still divided the two sides and it was
                    impossible to predict the outcome, he was glad to observe that the negotiations
                    were conducted in a businesslike way and would hope that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> would share his view. As for the
                    overall picture, some U.S. and Soviet views were not dissimilar, but the main
                    question remained, namely, what kind of relationship would the super-powers
                    have? This was important to the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and to the whole world. Relations could be more constructive
                    than they were in the past or continue to remain as they were. The U.S. was
                    prepared to defend its interests, but would prefer to move to more constructive
                    relations between the two powers.</p>
                <p>To sum up the second session, the areas of possible cooperation appeared to be
                    South Africa and non-proliferation. Finally, the Secretary stressed again the
                    importance that the U.S. placed on the question of human rights and asked
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> again to look at the list of
                    15 names presented by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName>
                    in the first meeting.</p>
                <p>In closing, <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                  </hi>
                    replied that he too appreciated the businesslike atmosphere of these discussions
                    and, as for any announcements or statements, each side was free to say whatever
                    it saw fit, but that the Soviet side would want to reserve the right to announce
                    necessary corrections if some distorted views of the talks were to appear. He
                    felt that these talks were of a closed and private nature. <hi rend="italic">The
                        Secretary</hi> suggested that the spokesmen for each side should work out a
                    suitable text.</p>
                <p>Over refreshments, the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> discussed the possibility of a further meeting prior to
                    next year’s <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>, and the two agreed to see
                    how events went in coming months.</p>

                </list>
                <p>Today’s return meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> at the
                    Soviet U.N. Mission went four-and-a-half hours. The atmosphere, as at our first
                    session, was serious and devoid of polemics. Basic differences were not
                    narrowed, but I believe we laid the foundation for future discussions.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> dealt at length on the Middle
                    East. His main point was that as a major power close to the region the Soviet
                    Union must be included in diplomatic efforts to achieve Middle East peace. While
                    he reiterated familiar Soviet support for a Palestinian state, he went out of
                    his way to repeat several times that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                    also supports Israel’s right to exist.</p>
                <p>Discussion proceeded from the Arab-Israeli dispute to the Iran/Iraq war. This
                    gave me the opportunity to tell <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                    we consider the Gulf an area of vital importance to us, and if the conflict
                    spreads to endanger our friends in the area this would be a matter of grave
                    concern to us.</p>
                <p>On human rights, I stressed Jewish emigration, and mentioned <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Anatoly Shcharanskiy</persName> as well as people with a
                    claim to American citizenship who wish to emigrate. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> claimed that emigration had declined because our
                    relations have turned down, but did not budge on substance.</p>
                <p>On Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> sounded the same
                    two notes as in the first meeting: the problem is mainly the result of outside
                    interference, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> favors the talks
                    taking place under the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary General’s
                    auspices with Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>I stressed the disruptive influence of Soviet support for the arms buildup and
                    political subversion in the Caribbean/Central America by Cuba and Nicaragua. I
                    told <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that the introduction of jet
                    fighter aircraft or armed Cuban forces in Nicaragua would be unacceptable to the
                    U.S.</p>
                <p>On southern Africa, I described the efforts we and the Contact Group are making
                    to achieve a Namibia settlement, and how Cuban <pb n="757" facs="0788" xml:id="pg_757"/>troop withdrawal from Angola is related to it. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> replied that the Soviets would like to
                    see the problem solved, but emphasized that Cuban troops would only leave after
                    the South Africans were out of Namibia.</p>
                <p>Turning to nuclear proliferation, I said this seemed to us to be an area where
                    the two countries might be able to work together. He replied that the Soviets
                    stand firmly in support of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and “are prepared to
                    act accordingly”.</p>
                <p>At the close of our meeting, I reiterated a point made last week: We are prepared
                    to go in a more constructive direction in our relationship, or continue as we
                    are. For our part, we would prefer to embark on a more constructive path, but
                    the choice is up to the Soviet Union.</p>

                <p>It is worthwhile to step back from the tactical details of our current
                    discussions with the Allies on the Poland-related sanctions to review our
                    overall progress on East-West relations. (C)</p>
                <p>From 1976 to 1980, you succeeded in transforming American public opinion
                    concerning East-West relations. You exposed the fatal weaknesses in detente
                    policies, and built support for a more realistic approach. From 1980 to 1982,
                    you changed U.S. government policy towards the Soviet Union. You increased
                    military expenditures, placed arms control policies on a sound basis, and
                    changed the tone of our public statements about the Soviet Union. Your challenge
                    for the <hi rend="italic">next</hi>
                    <pb n="758" facs="0789" xml:id="pg_758"/>two years is to change the public
                    opinions and government policies of our allies in the area of East-West economic
                    relations. This process will not be easy—the allies, for many reasons, consider
                    the detente era an unqualified success. Many in this Administration will say
                    that the difficulties of changing our Allies’ minds are insurmountable. Because
                    the effort will be ultimately unsuccessful, they argue, and because it will
                    generate friction in the Alliance, we should not try. I believe that as a matter
                    of principle we must continue to make every attempt to change the course of
                    East-West economic policy and its fueling of Soviet military might, and I am
                    confident that we can succeed. (C)</p>
                <p>In the two earlier phases of your efforts, objectives were fairly clear. Your
                    victory in the 1980 election capped the campaign to change U.S. opinion on
                    East-West relations; in the past two years your two defense budgets and your
                    arms reduction proposals have been identifiable milestones in changing U.S.
                    government policy towards the Soviet Union. For the next phase—changing the
                    opinions and policies of our allies—equally clear milestones are needed. In
                    priority order, I suggest that they are: (C)</p>
                <quote>
                  <p>1) Firm commitments from the Allies to buy no more natural gas from the

                        amounts;</p>
                    <p>2) A strengthened agreement on procedures to halt the flow of high Western
                        technology to the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>3) A firm pledge by our allies to end subsidized credits to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and tighten remaining credit terms.

               </quote>
                <p>We should measure our success against these objectives—not some
                    lowest-common-denominator agreement with the allies. (C)</p>
                <p>We should use the current round of repression in Poland to publicly make the
                    transition from a sanctions policy tied to events in Poland to a two-part
                    policy. The first part is to put in place an enduring East-West economic policy
                    based on the three objectives listed above. The second part is a modified
                    package of sanctions tied directly to events in Poland. Our rationale is that
                    Poland is not only a tragic event in itself, but also a manifestation of
                    underlying repressive character of the Soviet Union which must be met by
                    enduring unified Western policies in the area of East-West economic relations.

                <p>Mrs. Shcharanskiy met with the Secretary for 30 minutes at her request to discuss
                    the situation of her husband Anatoliy.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Shcharanskiy said that she was in the United States to assist her husband,
                    whose situation was very dangerous. He had been on hunger strike since September
                    27, was in poor health and was completely isolated in Soviet prison. Last year
                    she had met with the President, the Vice President, and the Secretary of State,
                    and President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> had said he would
                    help. Today Anatoliy’s life was at stake. She had heard many kind words about
                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> and hoped he could find
                    a way to help her husband.</p>
                <p>The Secretary assured Mrs. Shcharanskiy the United States Government was fully
                    aware of her husband’s situation and would do all it appropriately could to
                    assist. One of our recent efforts on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shcharanskiy</persName>’s behalf was made during the Secretary’s meetings
                    with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> in New York.<note n="2" xml:id="d224fn2">See <ref target="#d217">Documents 217</ref> and <ref target="#d221">221</ref>.</note> At the President’s direction, and in
                    accord with the Secretary’s own inclination, human rights issues were placed at
                    the top of our agenda. This marked a departure from the pattern of past meetings
                    with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, as did the fact that
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s response was more
                    substantive than heretofore. Just prior to the second meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> at the Soviet <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Mission, a group of U.S. Congressmen gathered outside of that
                    mission and handed the Secretary material about the <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shcharanskiy</persName> case as he entered. He was thus able to tell
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> that he had just received
                    information about the case, that <pb n="760" facs="0791" xml:id="pg_760"/>Mrs.
                    Shcharanskiy was in the U.S. to assist her husband and that many in Congress
                    shared her concern.</p>
                <p>The Secretary said he had conveyed to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>—and through him to the entire Soviet leadership—that the
                    United States was strong, and had strong allies. If the Soviet Union continued
                    with a pattern of behavior that threatened our interests, we would defend those
                    interests. But a more constructive U.S.-Soviet relationship was possible if
                    Moscow altered its behavior. Change in Soviet human rights practices, including
                    emigration, would be particularly significant—and it was in this context that
                    the Secretary called <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s attention
                    to the <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shcharanskiy</persName> case.</p>
                <p>It was very difficult to judge what impact this had on <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, the Secretary continued. And we did
                    not know what effect the meetings would have in Moscow. He had been joined in
                    the <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> meetings by Ambassador
                        <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> as well as by Under
                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> and Assistant
                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> was now back in Moscow. We have asked
                    our <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> Ambassador, Max Kampelman, to meet
                    with his Soviet counterpart to discuss human rights issues, and Ambassador
                        <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> would be following up these
                    issues in the Embassy’s contacts with Soviet officials in Moscow. But
                    decision-making processes in Moscow were at best murky: we had a general
                    impression that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> was not in good
                    health, and the smell of political succession was in the Moscow air.
                    Nonetheless, we had placed our concerns in front of the Soviet leadership and
                    had made clear that we would judge the prospects for an improved relationship on
                    the basis of Soviet deeds, not words. We had to be honest: we could not say we
                    had found the key to tragic situations such as the plight of Anatoliy
                    Shcharanskiy. The inhumanity of the Soviet system was sometimes difficult for us
                    to comprehend. We must all pray that the Soviets will heed the message we have
                    given them, and that Anatoliy Shcharanskiy will be spared.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Shcharanskiy indicated appreciation for what had been done but felt that her
                    husband had screamed for help by means of his hunger strike. He had become a
                    symbol for all Soviet Jews, as well as for all human rights activists in the
                        <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. She thought U.S. actions on her
                    husband’s behalf should be more intensive. Perhaps a prisoner exchange could be
                    worked out. Perhaps something could be done with respect to the President’s

                <p>The Secretary responded that a number of specific efforts were underway, and we
                    would continue our search for other approaches to the problem. We did not,
                    however, want to give Moscow the idea that it could gain major concessions from
                    the United States by tormenting prominent Soviet Jews; that is why the Secretary
                    had said we would do all that was appropriate. He hoped it would soon be
                    possible to give Mrs. Shcharanskiy more positive news, but at this moment he did
                    not want to create false hopes. We were well aware that good news regarding her
                    husband would be welcomed not only by her but also throughout the United States
                    and the world.</p>

                <p>I am writing to express my deep personal concern about the condition of Anatoly
                    Shcharansky. His plight has aroused a great deal of sympathy and support in the
                    United States.</p>
                <p>Since September 27, Mr. Shcharansky has been on a hunger strike which he has
                    undertaken to protest the denial to him by Chistopol’ prison authorities of
                    permission to write letters to his friends and relatives or to receive visits
                    from his mother or brother. After five years of incarceration, his health is
                    said to have deteriorated significantly. The continuation of a hunger strike
                    places his life in jeopardy.</p>
                <p>I urge you to give your personal attention to this matter, and I trust that some
                    way can be found to accommodate Mr. Shcharansky’s needs for greater
                    communication with his family within the requirements of your penal system.</p>

                    also urge your personal intervention to secure Mr. Shcharansky’s release from
                    prison and permission to join his family in Israel.<note n="2" xml:id="d225fn2">In telegram 298898 to Moscow, October 23, the Department instructed the

                </list>
                <p>We have received a troubling <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> assessment on
                    the potential market for Soviet gas in European markets through use of only one
                    strand of the Siberian pipeline and full use of existing infrastructure. This
                    illustrates very clearly that unless we can get a commitment from the Europeans
                    to limit their gas contracts to present levels, the Soviets will capture most of
                    the market of the 1990s and drive out the competitive alternatives.</p>
                <p>Attached (Tab I) are three visuals which tell the story.<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2">Attached but not printed.</note>
               </p>
                <p>Case I is the no Siberian gas case. The key here is that Dutch gas would have to
                    be increased over the short term, but over the longer <pb n="763" facs="0794" xml:id="pg_763"/>term, Norwegian and North African producers can meet
                    demand. This is the President’s original alternative energy case.</p>
                <p>Case II assumes that the first strand of the pipeline is completed but that there
                    are no more gas contracts with the Soviet Union. As you can see, there is still
                    room for alternatives, particularly Norwegian gas. Sufficient market is
                    preserved to allow development of the giant Troll field.</p>
                <p>Case III shows how big a chunk the Soviets can take out of the market with only
                    one strand, if some limitation is not imposed on contracts. The results are
                    dismaying. They can effectively block out all large scale alternatives. Only the
                    Sleipner field in Norway is assumed to be developed. Troll is knocked out.</p>
                <p>Bottom line: The Foreign Ministers communique is presently inadequate because it
                    does not contain a statement to limit gas purchases over the longer term. If we
                    do not get this commitment, then economic momentum will be on the side of the
                    Soviets. They have all the advantages. We must even the scales. I think that the
                    President must be made aware of this analytical evidence and the consequences of
                    not pressing the Europeans now to limit their gas purchases over the longer
                    term.</p>

                <p>1. (S—Entire text). Begin summary: <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> called on <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> at his request October 26 to deliver Soviet
                    announcement of same day launch within <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> of

                <p>2. On October 26 at 1700. Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> called at his request on Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> to deliver unofficial Soviet
                    Embassy translation of notification of same-day launch [of] a “new type” of
                    light <gloss target="#t_ICBM_1">ICBM</gloss> “RS–22” at Plesetsk. Text of
                    translation is given in para 3 below. <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> was accompanied by <gloss target="#t_EUR_1">EUR</gloss> Assistant Secretary-Designate <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName>, <gloss target="#t_EURSOV_1">EUR/SOV</gloss> Director
                        <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> and P Special Assistant
                        <persName corresp="#p_MH_1">Montgomery</persName>.</p>
                <p>3. Begin text: As a gesture of good will, the Soviet side informs the U.S. side
                    that the first launch of the “RS–22” light intercontinental ballistic missile of
                    a new type was carried out on October 26, 1982 in the Soviet Union, within its
                    national territory.</p>
                <p>. . . in submitting this notification the Soviet side is guided by the objective
                    to preserve all positive achievements of the SALT–2 negotiations. The present
                    notification is offered, of course, on a strictly confidential basis. End
                    text.</p>
                <p>4. With reference to the specification that the launch was of a “new type” of
                    system, <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> asked if it were possible
                    for us to conclude that this was the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s
                    designated new type under the provisions of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. Moscow saying that other systems which would be tested
                    will be variants of older types of systems? <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he “presumed” this was so, but was not 100 percent
                    sure.</p>
                <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> noted we had observed two new
                    systems under development, one larger than the other, and at least one which
                    appeared to be mobile, and he asked if one of these systems was involved.
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said he had no information
                    on this point.</p>
                <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> expressed his view that the
                    notification represented something of a departure for the Soviet side, and
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> reaffirmed that it is indeed
                    a gesture.</p>
                <p>7. With reference to the recently concluded conference on democratization in
                    Communist countries, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                    congratulated <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> on being a
                    good crusader. <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> rejoined that
                    the conference had been interesting, and should give the Soviets no cause for
                    concern. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> replied that they are
                    not concerned, but continue to be surprised at what kind of administration there
                    is in Washington.</p>
                <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s off-the-record assessment of the
                        <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> meetings. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said there had been no progress on the issues, but the
                    Soviet judgment was that agreement to move forward with discussions of human
                    rights/CSCE, Southern Africa and non-proliferation was welcome “small movement,
                    even though discussions on some of these and similar topics like Afghanistan had
                    been in train before.” <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName>
                    agreed. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked when the Soviet
                    side could expect answers to its proposals for beginning discussion on Southern
                    Africa and non-proliferation the week of November 9. In the <pb n="765" facs="0796" xml:id="pg_765"/>case of non-proliferation, it was a question of
                    using experts from the Soviet <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> delegation
                    or sending them back to Moscow. <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName>
                    said answers could be expected soon, and would probably suggest that discussions
                    begin somewhat later than the Soviets had proposed, perhaps in the late
                    November-early December timeframe.</p>
                <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> said he would be in New
                    Delhi in mid-November, and asked to be remembered to <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s former No. 2 in Washington (now Ambassador in New
                    Delhi) Vorontsov, on the off chance they would have occasion to meet.</p>
                <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked for our assessment of
                    the status of <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> and INF.</p>
                <p>11. With regard to INF, <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> said our
                    assessment is that the Soviet stance is a little tougher this round than last.
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked for an example.
                        <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> said it is a general
                    impression, based on the fact that the Soviet negotiator returned to announce
                    that he would be reiterating the basic Soviet position without change. With
                    regard to <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>, it is too early for us to
                    form the same kind of impression, <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName>
                    continued. We think it good that both sides are discussing the concept of
                    reductions and the same type of units of account, but we are still at the stage
                    of exploring views.</p>
                <p>12. With regard to the Soviet suggestion of a statement of principles, <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> continued, we are not opposed to the
                    approach per se; the difficulty is that the Soviets are suggesting the wrong
                    principles. It could be helpful to agree on basic principles, and there were
                    precedents, but they must be the same principles. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> rejoined that if the U.S. sticks to a zero option for a
                    whole year, the Soviets can be expected to put forward a version of their own.
                        <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> noted that the Soviets
                    had put forward a peculiar kind of zero option.</p>
                <p>14[<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> drew <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s attention to the fact that in briefing the press
                    following his meetings with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> the
                    Secretary had stressed that the two sides were approaching the negotiations
                    seriously. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked jovially
                    whether this was a message to the “next (Soviet) generation,” as Bernard
                    Gwertzman had claimed in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>.<note n="2" xml:id="d227fn2">A reference to Bernard Gwertzman, “U.S. is Preparing its
                        Policies With a New Kremlin Leader in Mind,” <hi rend="italic">New York
                            Times</hi>, October 25, 1982, p. A9.</note>
                    <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> replied that in all
                    seriousness our approach is that we deal with Soviet Governments one at a time,
                    and thus with the government in place; Gwertzman may not have invented his
                    story, but he did not get it from <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George
                        Shultz</persName>, or <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName>
                    himself, or from <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName>.</p>
                <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether in <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName>’s opinion <persName corresp="#p_REV_1">Rostow</persName>’s trip to Europe was helpful to the negotiations in
                    Geneva. <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> replied that he <pb n="766" facs="0797" xml:id="pg_766"/>thought it was, since it demonstrated our
                    commitment to progress in the negotiation. <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_REV_1">Rostow</persName>
                    seemed to have had a useful talk with Soviet negotiator <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Kvitsinskiy</persName>. He had also been talking to our
                    allies. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said the trouble was
                    that he appeared to be saying different things in these conversations. <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> surmised that some allies might
                    not have been listening as carefully as <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Kvitsinskiy</persName>, but asked for specific examples. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said his was a general impression.
                        <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> concluded that the
                    reports he had did not show such contradictions.</p>

                <p>I want to draw your attention to the fact that the question you touched upon in
                    your letter of last October 25,<note n="2" xml:id="d228fn2">See <ref target="#d225">Document 225</ref>.</note> concerns a Soviet citizen,
                    sentenced for espionage and other grave anti-Soviet crimes, and lies within the
                    exclusive competence of the Soviet State. There are neither legal nor any other
                    grounds for resolving it in the manner you would wish.</p>
                <p>At the same time, as I understand it, there is no basis for concern in this
                    matter.</p>
                <p>Sincerely,</p>

                <p>Assistant Secretary of State-Designate <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Richard
                        Burt</persName> opened the meeting by stating his belief that <gloss target="#t_ICCUSA_1">ICCUSA</gloss> should be revitalized. <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> explained that the Committee serves a
                    very useful function not only as a mechanism for information dissemination, but
                    for policy coordination, and in this regard, called for <gloss target="#t_ICCUSA_1">ICCUSA</gloss> to move from a concentration on
                    exchange-related matters to a broader policy focus. He noted that the US has
                    never been as successful as the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in
                    speaking with a single policy voice, and looked to <gloss target="#t_ICCUSA_1">ICCUSA</gloss> as a way of overcoming this difficulty. He proposed that
                        <gloss target="#t_ICCUSA_1">ICCUSA</gloss> meet approximately every two
                    months.</p>
                <p>Turning to the first agenda item, US-Soviet relations, <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> noted that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> had placed Soviet affairs at the top of
                    his foreign policy priorities. In the past, Soviet policy has often changed with
                    changes in administrations and personalities, but that has not been the case
                    with the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> transition.</p>
                <p>Discussing the <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> meetings, he described <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s argument that the downturn in
                    relations was due to US actions. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                    claimed that the US had barred the Soviets from playing a political role in
                    important regions of the world, and had unilaterally abandoned detente.
                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>, countered by stating
                    that the downturn was directly attributable to Soviet actions—in Angola, the
                    Horn of Africa, and Afghanistan, for example. The US position is that deeds, not
                    words, are important—and if there is no change in Soviet actions, then the
                    relationship will remain strained.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> remarked that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is now at a crossroads with its leadership
                    transition. Mindful of this, <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> took
                    great pains to detail US objections to Soviet actions so that the upcoming
                    leadership generation will have a clear idea of US foreign policy. <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> characterized our policy as an
                    undramatic, sober, firm one. The US will remain strong, revitalize its economic
                    power, and do whatever is necessary to strike a military balance.</p>
                <p>In sum, the message we have sent to the Soviets is that relations can go either
                    way—but the decision is now up to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>,
                    and the <pb n="768" facs="0799" xml:id="pg_768"/>US is prepared for longterm
                    competition. We will be watching Soviet behavior closely.</p>
                <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> representative commented that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s speech to the Defense Council<note n="2" xml:id="d229fn2">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s speech of October 27 to a conference of Soviet
                        military leaders at the Kremlin. (<hi rend="italic">Current Digest of the
                            Soviet Press</hi>, vol. 34, no. 43, November 24, 1982, pp. 1–3)</note>
                    raised interesting questions about Soviet policies. In his view, the speech did
                    not offer much reassurance to the Soviet military on defense issues.</p>
                <p>The question was raised whether US exchange participants should be briefed on US
                    policy before traveling to the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> answered that the exchangees should be briefed on policy,
                    so that they will understand the US stance, but not so that they will be used as
                    a channel of communication with the Soviets. The Commerce Department
                    representative noted that the state of US-Soviet relations makes it more
                    difficult to maintain useful relations with Eastern European countries. In
                    reply, <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> described our policy of
                    differentiation and noted as well that we do not treat Yugoslavia as a Warsaw
                    Pact state.</p>
                <p>Discussing reciprocity in US-Soviet relations, <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> stated that it is a point of principle that relations
                    proceed on an equitable basis, on the mundane level (e.g. protection of
                    nationals), as well as in more substantial areas (e.g. arms control). He noted
                    that this is a very difficult policy to administer: the closed Soviet society
                    gives the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> the advantage in controlling
                    matters of reciprocity. Nonetheless, reciprocity is essential in our dealings
                    with the Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_BRR_1">Burt</persName> cited the new
                    Foreign Missions Act as an important tool of reciprocity and introduced a staff
                    member of the State Department’s Office of Foreign Missions, who described the
                    powers accruing to the Department from the Act and offered to provide more
                    detailed briefings on the Act to any <gloss target="#t_ICCUSA_1">ICCUSA</gloss>
                    representative.</p>
                <p>The Assistant Secretary-Designate then left to meet with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Thomas W.
                        Simons, Jr.</persName>, Director of the Office of Soviet Union Affairs, took
                    the chair. Turning to other agenda items, <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> noted that all personal non-group travel to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> by US government employees must be cleared
                    in advance with the State Department. In this connection, he remarked that
                    hostile intelligence recruitment efforts remain a concern and asked
                    representatives to remind their agencies of this.</p>
                <p>On exchanges, <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> commented that it
                    may be time to take another look at our exchange policy, to identify areas where
                    exchanges operate to the detriment of the US, and conversely, to spot fields in
                    which the absence of exchange agreements puts the US Government <pb n="769" facs="0800" xml:id="pg_769"/>at a disadvantage in managing relations. The
                        <gloss target="#t_OSTP_1">OSTP</gloss> representative described a case
                    involving an <gloss target="#t_NOAA_1">NOAA</gloss>-managed exchange which
                    remained in effect for years at considerable cost and no benefit to the US. He
                    suggested that some agencies may not be aware of the importance of
                    reciprocity.</p>
                <p>The meeting was opened to comments from the representatives. Interior Department
                    representatives raised the need to designate an area coordinator, at the
                    Assistant Secretary level, for the wildlife conservation exchange. They stated
                    that participation at that level was necessary in order to mobilize resources
                    effectively within the Interior Department. It was noted, however, that the ban
                    on contacts at the Assistant Secretary level remains in force, and <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> agreed that it will be very difficult
                    to find reasons to rescind that sanction.</p>
                <p>Discussion then arose of the overall value to the US of exchanges, whether
                    exchange agreements with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> still served
                    US policy purposes and whether the agreements benefit the US taxpayer. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> commented that exchanges serve a useful
                    role as a part of the overall structure of bilateral relations, but also said
                    that the US must benefit from the exchanges in order to keep the programs going.
                    They should not serve merely a symbolic function. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> also warned that we must be alert to attempts by the
                    Soviets to “end-run” the official exchange structure and develop new exchanges
                    with private American organizations.</p>
                <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSF_1">NSF</gloss> representative informed the group that
                    he had heard that the Soviets were discussing de facto reconstitution of the
                    science and technology agreement with the American Council of Learned Societies,
                    and that the Council wants to use unexpended S&amp;T funds for discussions with
                    the Soviets. In the <gloss target="#t_NSF_1">NSF</gloss>’s view, those funds
                    should only be used for wind-up activities. Greenberg asked if <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName>’ earlier comments meant that we should
                    now consider revitalizing the S&amp;T agreement. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> replied that that was not necessarily the case, but that
                    we need to identify any ways in which the absence of exchange agreements works
                    against our interests. The <gloss target="#t_FBI_1">FBI</gloss> representative
                    then asked if these S&amp;T discussions could be halted through visa denials;
                        <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> felt that we could run into
                    problems with visa procedures.</p>
                <p>The <gloss target="#t_OSTP_1">OSTP</gloss> representative said that he would be
                    interested to know the overall level of exchange activity. He suspects that the
                    level is lower than during more cordial periods, regardless of Soviet end-run
                    activities. He also stated that representatives should pay close attention to
                    the need for decisions on exchange renewals, and cited the Agricultural
                    Agreement as an example. He noted the seeming Soviet propensity for “December
                    surprises” and remarked on the need for US agencies to have their options on the
                    Agricultural and other agreements cleared well in advance of the renewal
                    deadlines.</p>

                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s speech has unleashed a flood of
                    paper. The controversial question is: did he say something really new which
                    presents a fresh threat to us, or did he merely reiterate old themes? In the two
                    attached memoranda (Tab I, November 2; and Tab II, October 29<note n="3" xml:id="d230fn3">Tab II is attached but not printed.</note>), State
                    reaffirms its view that the October 27 speech did <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                    represent a new departure and does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> presage a major
                    military effort. I concur with State’s evaluation on the following grounds:</p>
                <quote>
                  <p>—<persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> did not promise his
                        military audience to increase defense spending but urged them to improve
                        their performance.</p>
                    <p>—He stressed the improvement in Soviet-Chinese relations which most likely
                        was meant to reassure his audience that the Soviet international situation
                        is better than it has been for some time.</p>
                    <p>—The day after <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> had delivered
                        his speech, <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName>, his closest
                        collaborator and apparent choice for successor, spoke in Tiflis and
                        downplayed the U.S. military threat.</p>
               </quote>
                <p>State seems correct to me in arguing that the main thrust of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s talk was that the Soviet armed
                    forces must do better with what they have rather than count on more money and
                    resources.</p>

                        Leaders: Why All the Confusion?</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>U.S. media analyses of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s October
                    27 speech to Soviet military leaders have distorted the substance of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s remarks. Some interpretations
                    virtually ignore the actual content of the speech. Few show awareness of the
                    context in which the speech was delivered.</p>
                  <p>Subsequent developments in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> seem to
                    support our view that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s speech
                    disclosed no fundamental policy shifts and was in fact addressed primarily to
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s immediate audience, the
                    Soviet military establishment. For example:</p>
                  <p>—<persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s speech preceded a major
                    address to the same audience by Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName> on “the state of combat and political training in the
                    army and navy and tasks of its further perfection.” The full text of <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName>’s remarks has not been published,
                    perhaps because it was sharply critical of the military (<persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName> is reputed to be a hard-driving
                    perfectionist). However, the initial portion, as carried on Soviet television,
                    indicates that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s remarks were
                    intended to set the stage for <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName>’s
                    critique of Soviet military preparedness.</p>
                  <p>—The day after <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s speech,
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s protege <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName> addressed an award ceremony in the
                    Georgian capital of Tbilisi and was a little less harsh than his mentor in
                    discussing the United States. In particular, <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName> did not dwell on U.S. military preparations.</p>
                  <p>—And, in a related development, senior members of <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>’s <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> Institute who are
                    currently visiting Washington commented privately that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s remarks about the U.S. were blunt
                    because of the audience he was addressing, not because of a basic change in
                    Moscow’s thinking.</p>
                  <p>In light of these developments, we believe <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s unusually stark characterization of the U.S. military
                    threat was in the first instance crafted to underscore the urgency of improving
                    deficiencies in combat and political training in the Soviet armed forces. It did
                    not mark a <pb n="772" facs="0803" xml:id="pg_772"/>fundamental change in
                    Moscow’s current assessment of U.S. policy, though <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName>’s follow-up speech did hint at Soviet toughness in
                    arms control negotiations and implied that Moscow would not be intimidated by
                    any U.S. military programs. Similarly, we continue to be skeptical that
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s speech broke new ground
                    with regard to Soviet military spending. His basic message here was that the
                    Soviet military-industrial complex and the armed forces must do better with
                    sizable resources they are currently provided, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> that
                    they are going to receive an even larger slice of the resource pie.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Issue</p>
                <p>Now that we have reached agreement with the Allies on the non-paper, the issue
                    before you is to select the appropriate U.S. response in terms of modifying our
                    unilateral oil and gas controls.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Facts</p>
                <p>The following options will be presented to you at the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting:</p>
                <p>Option 1: Lift all oil and gas equipment and technology sanctions against the
                    Soviet Union.</p>
                <pb n="773" facs="0804" xml:id="pg_773"/>
                <p>Option 2: As recommended in attached memo<note n="2" xml:id="d231fn2">Not found
                        attached.</note> from Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName>,
                    cancel the June 22 measures, and resulting denial orders; retain December 29
                    controls with broad “exceptions” criteria including grandfathering pre-December
                    contracts.</p>
                <p>Option 3: “Toughen” the recommendations in the <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName> memo
                    through an <gloss target="#t_NSDD_1">NSDD</gloss>, requiring speedy agreement on
                    multilateral controls on critical oil and gas equipment in the context of the
                    study called for in the non-paper.</p>
                <p>Option 4: Lift only the June 22 measures pending the separate successful
                    negotiation of multilateral controls on critical oil and gas equipment.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                <p>Your selection from these options depends on the approach you think will be most
                    effective in translating the broad principles of the non-paper into specific
                    firm commitments. Option 1 relies completely on the good faith of the Allies in
                    living up to the spirit of the non-paper. The history of this issue is not
                    encouraging in this respect. Option 4 requires new concessions from the
                    Europeans before we will grandfather pre-December contracts, and would probably
                    be contested by them, if not rejected. Option 2 occupies the middle ground on a
                    U.S. response. You should understand that it will be difficult for the Commerce
                    Department to administer, because of its complexity. Vigilant high-level
                    attention will be required to ensure it does not degenerate into Option 1. The
                    liberal “exceptions” policy of Option 2 can forfeit any future U.S. leverage and
                    prejudge unfavorably the outcome of the study on oil and gas technology
                    controls. Option 3 addresses these limitations directly by accelerating the
                    study on multilateral oil and gas controls to replace the exceptions policy as
                    quickly as possible.</p>
                <p>The confused public handling of this issue in recent months argues strongly for a
                    clear statement from you at this critical juncture. The cabinet must be informed
                    that your statement and the White House-issued press guidance on these decisions
                    will govern all public and private explanation of our policy. Poland remains at
                    the center of this policy—the prolonged repression of the Poles has been the
                    catalyst in the forging of an enduring, security-minded East-West economic
                    policy.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">RECOMMENDATION</p>
                <p>That you select one of the four options modifying U.S. sanctions as the U.S.
                    response to agreement on the non-paper.<note n="3" xml:id="d231fn3">

                    consultations with the Allies. Although the President might not be ready to make
                    a decision at the meeting, he continued, the Secretary of State needed a
                    selection by the President from among the four options<note n="3" xml:id="d232fn3">See <ref target="#d231">Document 231</ref>.</note> in order
                    to inform the Allies. (C)</p>
                <p>Secretary <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>
                  </hi>
                    said that although during the consultations, the Allies there had been careful
                    not to discuss the pipeline sanctions, they <pb n="776" facs="0807" xml:id="pg_776"/>were now “curious” to know what action the President would
                    take to modify the sanctions. The consultations with the Allies, he continued,
                    had identified the common ground in the area of East-West economic relations.
                    This common ground enabled the Allies to feel that they had not been negotiating
                    with the United States under duress, and the United States for its part was able
                    to put forward an agreement in a positive, upbeat manner. The Secretary stated
                    that he would address four topics: the status of the discussions with the
                    Allies; a review of the non-paper; the side letters to the paper; and the
                    Poland-related sanctions. (C)</p>
                <p>Concerning the status of the discussions, the Secretary pointed out that although
                    the paper was in a final form, final Allied approval depended on U.S. sanctions
                    modifications. He pointed out that certain words in the text of the paper such
                    as “subsidize” and “strategic interests” were ambiguous. There was an inherent
                    ambiguity in these words that could only be worked out as the paper became
                    “concrete and operational.” There were several side letters to be written in
                    conjunction with the paper: the Italians wanted reassurance that the contracts
                    covered in the “pause for reflection” which they had instituted would not be
                    considered “new contracts,” therefore subject to the agreement of the non-paper.
                    The Federal Republic wanted similar reassurances on an imminent gas agreement
                    covering Berlin. The Japanese wanted assurances concerning the Sakhalin project,
                    for which contracts were signed on a yearly basis. The Belgians wanted an
                    assurance for contracts similar to those of Italy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> pointed out all these situations were
                    straight-forward, legitimate, in good faith and that the countries concerned
                    were seeking reasonable assurances. Concerning the interpretation of the word
                    “subsidize,” the side letter would point out that the definition of the word is
                    not identical among all the governments. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> thought that this side letter might be better handled by
                    other means during the consultations. There was also a potential side letter
                    concerning the phrase “common approach.” The United States was concerned that
                    this phrase not be interpreted to mean that countries could only take actions
                    which were agreed by all of them. The United States had asserted in the
                    consultations that it might still be necessary to take unilateral actions.
                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> then stated that Under
                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WWA_1">Wallis</persName> had rejected a European
                    proposal on a joint examination of the legal aspects of extraterritoriality.
                    Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WWA_1">Wallis</persName> had said that
                    such a study could be undertaken as a separate effort, but not as part of the
                    non-paper. (C)</p>
                <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> next reviewed the
                    contents of the non-paper for the members of the National Security Council. He
                    covered the introduction, the section listing criteria for East-West trade, a
                    list of areas for study, and the near-term undertakings in the study. He
                    concluded this <pb n="777" facs="0808" xml:id="pg_777"/>description by pointing
                    out that the United States would attempt to remove or make side letters
                    unnecessary, but that if this were not successful, he would have no hard
                    objection to the side letters. (C)</p>
                <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> then turned to the
                    schedule for further consultations. He said that a meeting had been scheduled
                    for tomorrow, November 10, with the four European countries affected by the
                    American temporary denial orders. He said at that meeting he hoped to inform
                    those countries what the President’s intentions were for modifying the
                    sanctions. Later in the afternoon of November 10 there was a meeting of the
                    “Seven plus two” in which the entire package would be reviewed. In an effort to
                    avoid the disagreements which had followed the Versailles Summit, all the Allies
                    would agree on what they would say publicly. The American preference was to
                    distribute the non-paper. The French had objected. As an alternative, the State
                    Department had distributed to the Allies a precis of the paper in the form of
                    talking points which the President would use, and had asked for a similar paper
                    from each of the Allies by tomorrow. At the 10 November afternoon meeting, the
                    task was to put the papers together and to coordinate the public pronouncements.
                    The Secretary noted that the non-paper would in due course become public through
                    leaks in any case and that this was nothing to be worried about since it was a
                    good paper, one to be proud of. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> concluded that by tomorrow afternoon the Allies could be
                    very close to a final agreement on all elements in the package requiring only a
                    few cables among foreign ministers and capitals to wrap it up. (C)</p>
                <p>Judge <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName>
                  </hi> asked
                    if the Secretary considered it worthwhile for the President to send a message
                    through his channels to the other heads of state. (C)</p>
                <p>Secretary <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>
                  </hi>
                    said that the basic public line of all the heads of state should be that the
                    paper represented a victory for the Alliance, not for any individual country. It
                    was necessary to have an upbeat, positive presentation. It would be good for the
                    President to emphasize this interpretation to his counterparts. The Secretary
                    had met earlier in the afternoon with German Defense Secretary Manfred Woerner
                    and had given him this message concerning public handling of the issues. Woerner
                    had promised to take this message back to Chancellor Kohl. In conclusion,
                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> said messages from the
                    President to his counterparts would be desirable. (C)</p>
                <p>Judge <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName>
                  </hi>
                    reviewed the manner in which the U.S. would announce the arrangement. The
                    President would announce the overall agreement on East-West trade, then the
                    “action would shift” to the question of modifying the U.S. sanctions, and the
                    announcement on this subject would be handled by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName>, who actually was responsible for
                    administering the sanctions. <pb n="778" facs="0809" xml:id="pg_778"/>The idea
                    would be that the President would announce the broad outlines of the agreement,
                    and then give directions to his departments to implement them. This was similar
                    to the way in which these sanctions had been imposed. (C)</p>
                <p>Secretary <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>
                  </hi>
                    said that he would be giving a background briefing with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName>. He would elaborate on the overall
                    agreement, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName> would
                    field the questions on the sanctions themselves. (C)</p>
                <p>Before the views of the other members of the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                    were given, the <hi rend="italic">President</hi> stated that what he wanted to
                    know was whether the agreement which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> had worked out was superior to what the United States now
                    had in place. He recalled that Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BJL_1">Buckley</persName> had gone to Europe to work out common measures. If he
                    had succeeded there would have been no need for U.S. sanctions. Neither had
                    there been any success at the Versailles or Bonn Summits in working out common
                    sanctions. (C)</p>
                <p>Secretary <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>
                  </hi>
                    said that the agreement was basically a good one. It was, of course, impossible
                    to say whether the work program laid out in the agreement would meet all U.S.
                    objectives. However, a certain momentum was being generated and it looked
                    promising. As for the concrete content of the agreement, the improvements to
                        <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> were actually in progress. The
                    agreement that there be no new gas contracts signed for the course of the study
                    was a clear commitment. Basically, the paper was a commitment by the Alliance to
                    work out an economic strategy to complement the military strategy and the
                    strategy on values which the Alliance already had. It was appalling to him that
                    the Alliance did not have one already. As for the studies, the Secretary
                    recommended strongly that they go forward and that the U.S. government assign
                    their best people to them. Properly done, the studies could be of great
                    significance. There was always the possibility that they could peter out and
                    produce no concrete results, but the Secretary doubted it. The agreement on
                    credit policy was a plus, in the Secretary’s view. He hoped that an arrangement
                    could be worked out. Other credit agreements having nothing to do with the
                    Soviet Union had been negotiated from time to time and had not been terribly
                    successful, but it was worthwhile trying again. Concerning the agreement to
                    study controls on high-technology items outside the military sector,
                    specifically oil and gas controls, the Secretary thought that the possibilities
                    were good of obtaining some positive commitments. He did not expect sweeping
                    controls, but some individual items could be identified. The Secretary continued
                    to say that the United States had “gotten a lot of mileage” out of the pipeline
                    controls. They had focused the attention of the Allies and they had focused
                    world attention on Poland. There had been damage done to the pipeline in terms
                    of delaying it and <pb n="779" facs="0810" xml:id="pg_779"/>creating
                    difficulties for it, although the intelligence community had different views on
                    the exact nature of these effects. In the end, however, the Soviets would
                    complete this pipeline, as they had many other pipelines. When the Soviets
                    completed the pipeline, the United States did not want to have its pipeline
                    sanctions in place, since this would give the appearance of failure. There was a
                    point, therefore, when it was important to modify the pipeline sanctions. In the
                    Secretary’s judgement, we had just about reached that point. (C)</p>
                <p>Secretary <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>
                  </hi> agreed that the non-paper had good potential.
                    The criteria were especially good. However, he pointed out that the paper was
                    basically an agreement to consider an agreement, with the exception of the
                    commitment not to sign new gas contracts. The undertakings on <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> were nothing new. The agreements on
                    credit, an <hi rend="italic">ex post</hi> review and a harmonization of
                    policies, would be good if they were fulfilled. The studies had potential to
                    have greater results, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> felt, if the U.S. sanctions were lifted in a way that
                    retained leverage in U.S. hands. More leverage was needed than simply assigning
                    good people to do the studies. After the Versailles Summit, the agreements had
                    been disavowed by some of the participants. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> pointed out that some French
                    officials were already saying privately that the paper contained nothing new.
                    Very little could come from the paper and the studies unless the United States
                    retained some leverage. He agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> that the sanctions that the United States had imposed had
                    given positive results. Without the pain they had inflicted there would have
                    been no movement on the common agreement. The manner of lifting the sanctions
                    would give the opportunity to ensure the studies were completed and gave
                    concrete commitments. In summary, the United States should get something solid
                    in return for lifting its sanctions. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName>, therefore, recommended a variation on option four:
                    that the temporary denial orders be rescinded and that enforcement of the June
                    18 measures be suspended pending completion of the studies. When these studies
                    resulted in concrete commitments, the rest of the sanctions would be eliminated.
                    This leverage would be retained to prevent a repetition of Versailles. (C)</p>
                <p>Secretary <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName>
                  </hi>
                    pointed out that the effectiveness of the sanctions was now at its height.
                    Within a couple of years it would diminish as companies and countries figured
                    out ways to work around the sanctions. In his opinion if the studies showed
                    promise, then it was sensible to drop these sanctions before they became weaker.
                    Although he had signed a memo with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> which recommended option 2, he was now changing his
                    recommendation to option 1. Option 4 simply penalized American companies while
                    European companies took their business. If the agreement was in fact better than
                    the sanctions, then <pb n="780" facs="0811" xml:id="pg_780"/>the clean,
                    unambiguous action of option 1 should be taken. Even under option 1 the
                    Afghanistan sanctions relating to oil and gas equipment would still be in place,
                    as would the export control mechanisms. The important thing was to relieve the
                    uncertainty for American businessmen and customers. Uncertainty prevented from
                    going ahead with their plans. If the December sanctions were retained, the
                    effect would be that Alsthom Atlantique would take over contracts for rotors
                    which General Electric was unable to compete for. (C)</p>

                    whether the President himself would announce both the overall agreement and
                    lifting the sanctions. Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName>
                    replied that the President would announce the overall agreement and the Commerce
                    Department would announce the sanctions modifications. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJA_1">Baker</persName> replied that from the press point of

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> stated that it was necessary to say publicly
                    that the United States would have preferred to have had an agreement like this

                    pointed out that instead of saying that the United States had obtained this
                    agreement from its Allies, he could therefore lift the sanctions, he could say
                    something like “in the light of this agreement . . .” (C)</p>

                    concluded that it was [his] opinion that the President should announce both the

                <p>In reply to a question from Counsellor <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Meese</persName>
                  </hi>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName> said that option 2 would solve some
                    but not all of the problems of U.S. companies which had been affected by these
                    sanctions. It would not solve General Electric’s problem with its rotors. He
                    frankly said he did not understand what leverage over the Allies would remain
                    with option 2. (C)</p>
                <p>Counsellor <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Meese</persName>
                  </hi>
                    said that option 2, the “broad exception” option, would give the U.S.
                    flexibility. The concept as he understood it was a gradual loosening of U.S.
                    controls except for selected areas of high technology. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> agreed that this was the case, and that
                    option 2 would allow Caterpillar and Allis-Chalmers to compete for contracts.
                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName> interjected that the
                    effect was still to leave U.S. companies under controls but not European
                    companies. (C)</p>

                    said that controls would remain in place, but that companies would proceed with
                    their contracts under the exceptions. The United States would restrain certain
                    high technology items. It was true that some of our companies would be
                    penalized, but this would be a form of leverage. A structure would also be in
                    place so that further actions could be taken if necessary. (C)</p>

                  </hi>
                    said that the structure for controls would exist in any case. He still failed to
                    see why how controlling U.S. companies but not European companies gave us
                    leverage over European governments. (C)</p>

                    said that he agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>’s analysis of the importance of the agreement. His
                    recommendation was option 2. He pointed out that under option 2 companies would
                    still be competing for many non-Soviet contracts and for Soviet contracts under
                    the exceptions policy. (C)</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Vice President</hi> inquired whether option 2 would allow
                    the Cameron Company to sell blowout preventers to the Soviet Union. Secretary
                        <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> replied that these were high
                    technology, U.S.-origin items and would be candidates for remaining under
                    controls. The Vice President said that a lot of money was involved in these
                    contracts and that it was not entirely clear that they were sensitive technology
                    and should be controlled. (C)</p>

                     <persName corresp="#p_OLH_1">Olmer</persName>
                  </hi> said that the blowout preventers could be sold. The
                    only items which would be held would be rock bits and submersible pumps under
                    option 2. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> said that
                    option 2 would retain controls over more than just bits and pumps; there was a
                    list of additional equipment which would be covered. (C)</p>
                <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_OLH_1">Olmer</persName> continued that the
                    U.S. would be attempting to obtain multilateral controls on this type of
                    equipment, but that if they were unsuccessful, then the equipment would be
                    allowed to be shipped as an exception. (C)</p>

                    emphasize the security context. He said that tightening <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> restrictions alone is a tremendous

                    an agreement with the Allies, but if the studies failed to control high
                    technology items, then the military tasks of the United States would be more
                    difficult. From his point of view options 2, 3, or 4 would be acceptable.

                    said that, in answer to the President’s question, the agreement was better than
                    what the United States now had. He favored option 1. The problem of businessmen
                    was uncertainty, and the exceptions policy of option 2 retained this
                    uncertainty. Controls <pb n="782" facs="0813" xml:id="pg_782"/>would still
                    remain under option 1 to prohibit the export to the Soviet Union of sensitive
                    high technology products which were unique and controlled by the U.S. He said
                    the effect of options 2, 3, or 4 would be simply to put additional U.S. products
                    under controls which other countries could manufacture and win U.S.
                    contracts.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> asked for a clarification of the difference
                    between option 1 and option 2. Under Secretary <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#p_OLH_1">Olmer</persName>
                  </hi> explained that under the 1978
                    Afghanistan sanctions and prior controls, the United States prohibited the
                    export to the Soviet Union of oil and gas exploration and production equipment
                    and technology. It did not under these controls, prohibit export of equipment
                    for refining or transmission and had not controlled foreign subsidiaries and
                    licensees. The measures taken in June controlled subsidiaries and licensees. The
                    measures of December 1981 controlled refining and transmission equipment.
                    Therefore, under option 1, two of the four oil and gas equipment areas would
                    remain under controls, whereas under option 2, all four areas would remain under
                    control. In addition, under option 2 there would be a small amount of additional
                    leverage concerning extraterritoriality. Concerning G.E.’s rotors, the hope
                    would be that the agreement reached after the studies on high technology items
                    would prevent Alsthom Atlantique from displacing General Electric in the world
                    market. (C)</p>

                    under option 2. He pointed out that despite all the talk that Alsthom Atlantique
                    could replace General Electric, there had been no sign in the four months since
                    the June measures that it was able to do so. Most observers believed it would
                    take at least two years to accomplish this. In addition, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> pointed out that the situation in
                    Poland was getting even worse. He reiterated that under option 4 the December
                    sanctions would be removed once solid commitments had emerged from the studies.

                    said that the wording of option 1 was not completely correct. It was not true
                    that “all sanctions” would be lifted. It was more accurate to say that the
                    measures taken in December 1981 and June 1982 would be lifted. (C)</p>

                <p>In a diary entry for November 11, 1982, President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Ronald Reagan</persName> wrote that his day started at 3:30 a.m., when
                    President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs William “<persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName> called with word that <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> died.” (Brinkley, ed., <hi rend="italic">The <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                        Diaries</hi>, Volume I, page 171) At 10:01 a.m. in the State Dining Room at
                    the White House, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> delivered
                    remarks presenting the Presidential Citizens Medal to Raymond Weeks at a
                    Veterans Day Ceremony. At the close of these remarks, the President read the
                    letter he had just sent to Vasiliy Kuznetsov, First Deputy Chairman of the
                    Presidium in Moscow. “Please accept my condolences on the death of President
                    Leonid Il’ich <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>. President
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> was one of the world’s most
                    important figures for nearly two decades. May I ask you to convey our sympathies
                    to the President’s family. I would also like to convey through you to the Soviet
                    Government and people the strong desire of the United States to work toward an
                    improved relationship with the Soviet Union. I look forward to conducting
                    relations with the new leadership in the Soviet Union with the aim of expanding
                    the areas where our two nations can cooperate to mutual advantage.” After
                    reading this letter, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> added: “Now,
                    I’ve said for many years there are fundamental differences between the Soviet
                    system and our own system here in the United States. But I believe our peoples,
                    for all our differences, share a desire and a dedication to peace.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>

                    it will be the V.P., Secretary of State &amp; our Ambassador. Incidentally our

                    That day, following a brief hospital visit after he choked on a fish bone at

                    departed from Andrews Air Force Base for Moscow, to meet Vice President

                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>, General Secretary
                        <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> first wanted to express his
                    personal appreciation for the respect manifested by the United States toward the
                    Soviet Union on this sad occasion of the death of President <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Leonid I. Brezhnev</persName> as indicated by the high
                    rank of the delegation dispatched to Moscow by the United States.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> said that the recent remarks by
                    President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> to the effect that he
                    wanted to conduct a policy of improving Soviet/American relations had not gone
                    unnoticed on the Soviet side,<note n="2" xml:id="d234fn2">Presumably a reference
                        to <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s November 11 remarks; see
                            <ref target="#d233">Document 233</ref>.</note> and he wanted to add that
                    the intentions of the Soviet leadership were certainly analogous. At the recent
                    Plenum of the Central Committee of the <gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss>
                    and at today’s solemn ceremony, he had already had occasion to state that the
                    principled policy of the Soviet leadership would remain unchanged and as
                    consistent as it had been during the life of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Leonid
                        I. Brezhnev</persName>. In this connection he wanted to say that this
                    consistent policy of the Soviet Union toward the U.S. had been and would
                    continue to be based on equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each
                    other’s internal affairs. Above all it would be a policy aimed at peaceful
                    development of relations. He would not conceal the fact that the relations
                    between our two countries today were quite complex. However, it was not the
                    Soviet side which had dealt with the other as an adversary. Moreover, the Soviet
                    Union invariably and consistently displayed restraint in the face of unfriendly
                    and at times openly hostile remarks and steps on the U.S. side. Displaying such
                    restraint, the Soviet Union was not doing it because it was unsure of its
                    strength. The U.S. side or anyone else for that matter should have no illusions
                    on this score. The Soviet leadership acted in this fashion because it believed
                    that such a policy was sensible and that to act otherwise would hold no
                    promise.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> wanted to draw the attention of
                    the U.S. side to the fact that due to U.S. actions, at present almost the entire
                    stock of stability between the two countries, which had been built up over the
                    years, had been carelessly squandered. This was true of almost the entire
                    reserve of stability which served to insure both sides against unpleasant
                    surprises. He thought that both sides clearly understood that if such an erosion
                    of the productive layer of Soviet/American relations were allowed to continue,
                    there would be no guarantee that this would not bring the sides to catastrophe.
                    He therefore believed that the urgent task today was to put an end to this
                    process. He understood, of course, that matters could not be helped simply by
                    verbal promises, but it was surely a fact, and he would like the Vice President
                    to understand him correctly, that it would be desirable for our two countries to
                    halt further <pb n="786" facs="0817" xml:id="pg_786"/>spirals in the arms race
                    and to reach agreement at the current negotiations on European and nuclear arms
                    on a mutually agreeable basis that would not prejudice the interests of either
                    side and would be based on strict adherence to the principle of equality and
                    equal security. Of course, there really was no other way out of the present
                    predicament, because if the arms build up continues, the U.S. side would build
                    up, the Soviet side would build up too, and one might well ask where this would
                    lead in the end and what would be the end result. After all, all present here
                    today were certainly experienced and sophisticated people, and he was sure that
                    his friend <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">A.A. Gromyko</persName> shared his views
                    in saying that it would be completely impossible for either side to believe that
                    it could come to any negotiation with proposals that were unacceptable to the
                    other side. This applied to both sides. Of course, the two sides could engage in
                    debate and even sometimes scold each other in the press or in some other forum,
                    but when it came to specific matters it was absolutely necessary to act as
                    sober-minded and normal people. There was no way of evading this requirement.
                        <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> noted that at present there
                    was insufficient trust between the two sides, i.e. trust on the part of the
                    Soviet Union as well as on the part of the United States, but the Vice President
                    should understand that this was so because universally accepted standards of
                    conduct had been violated and attempts had been undertaken to interfere in the
                    internal affairs of the other side. The Soviet leadership resolutely rejected
                    such a policy of dictating one’s own standards to the other side. No one had the
                    right to do so or to dictate what the other side could or could not do.</p>
                <p>He wanted to point out that the entire Soviet leadership had been and continued
                    to be in favor of an active and businesslike dialogue between our two countries
                    with respect to matters of mutual interest and questions that required
                    businesslike discussion. There were certainly many such questions and the Soviet
                    Union was in favor of broadening the range of problems discussed in negotiations
                    and exchanging views in a direct dialogue in order to give such negotiations
                    specific content and to insure that they would result in developing good and
                    stable relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. Such relations
                    would certainly be conducive to a far more healthy international atmosphere than
                    existed today.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> apologized to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName> for raising these questions on this, not
                    the most auspicious occasion, realizing that, after all, he and Secretary
                        <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> had come to Moscow to express
                    his condolences and sympathy to the Soviet Union at this moment of grief.
                    However, the Soviet leadership wanted to have good relations in fact, and he
                    would appreciate this being conveyed to President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>. Naturally, these relations had to be based on equality
                    without prejudice to the interests of either country. He was well aware of the
                    fact that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>
                    <pb n="787" facs="0818" xml:id="pg_787"/>and his friend <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> were used to this kind of dialogue
                    because they were battle-hardened men, but he had felt that this first meeting
                    between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName> and himself, even on
                    this sad occasion, should be used as an opportunity to express these views.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> thought that if this brief speech
                    of his could contribute to improvement of relations between us, this meeting
                    would have been well worthwhile. In conclusion he would ask the Vice President
                    to convey the views expressed to President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> and to express to him best wishes on behalf of the entire
                    Soviet leadership, wishes for continued success and good health. He also asked
                        <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName> to convey to the President the
                    gratitude of the Soviet leadership for the condolences he had expressed on this
                    sad occasion of the passing of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">L.I.
                        Brezhnev</persName>, in particular when he had visited the Soviet Embassy in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName> first wanted to
                    express officially the condolences we had come here to express and to tender to
                        <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> and his colleagues our
                    thanks for the extraordinary courtesies extended to us not only here but also in
                    Washington by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> interrupted to repeat his thanks
                    for these condolences, and also for the condolences in writing which President
                        <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> had conveyed in
                        Washington.<note n="3" xml:id="d234fn3">See <ref target="#d233">Document
                            233</ref>.</note>
               </p>
                <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName> said he felt that he
                    knew <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> and that he was delighted
                    to meet him at this table. He thought the two of them had a somewhat similar
                    background. When <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Bill Clark</persName> had become
                    the head of the National Security Council <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName> had invited Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> to his home for the purpose of meeting <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName>. He had asked <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> to be as frank with us as <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> had been today. In the same spirit of
                    frankness we could, even on this sad occasion, as he had done with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>, detail some of the problems of deep
                    concern to us, such as Afghanistan, Poland, and human rights from the standpoint
                    of international norms, and one or two others. He could assure the General
                    Secretary that we did not intend to interfere in the internal affairs of others
                    but had to say that the American people felt strongly about these issues. We
                    were committed, under this President, to maintaining the strength of our
                    military forces, at a level adequate for our security, but we are not interested
                    in an arms race. We shared the commitment which seemed to be expressed here
                    regarding the need to have fruitful talks, but we believe that, in the arms
                    control field, these must be based on verifiable agreements which provide for
                    real reduction in arms. The Vice President said that the President is deadly
                    serious on this issue.</p>
                <pb n="788" facs="0819" xml:id="pg_788"/>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName> said that he had noted some
                    contentious areas of deep concern to us, areas where we hoped change would be
                    possible on the Soviet side. He could assure <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> that we would respond positively to any positive
                    changes. He could not agree more that the objective of our negotiations had to
                    be preservation of peace and stability. <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> had said that the Soviet Union had acted with restraint
                    in the face of what it considered to be hostile actions. Time did not allow
                        <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName> to develop this theme, to
                    rebut <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s contentions, or to
                    detail our list of Soviet actions which we considered hostile. Still, if both
                    sides felt it was possible to make progress, it was an important fact. The Vice
                    President said he had noted the young men who had marched in the parade at
                    today’s ceremony. He himself had four sons and of course could not help but hope
                    that the negotiations in Geneva would bear fruit. The Vice President appreciated
                        <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s taking time to meet with
                    us and wanted to wish him well on his accession to great new responsibilities.
                    We were ready to do our part.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> thanked the Vice President and
                    the Secretary for this meeting and once again for the goodwill manifested in
                    coming here to share the grief of the Soviet people. He did not believe it
                    necessary to go into the details of the questions each of them had raised today,
                    but of course these problems did exist and they should be understood from a
                    correct perspective. At present the US side had its own understanding of these
                    matters, as did the Soviet side. It was therefore necessary to sit down and talk
                    and resolve the differences between us, but this was not the occasion to do so.
                    He would therefore once again thank the Vice President for the views he had
                    expressed, and would ask him once again to convey his best regards to President
                        <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> and assure the President that
                    the most sincere wish of the Soviet leadership was to improve and strengthen the
                    relations between the Soviet Union and the U.S., since this would be in the
                    interests of not only our two countries, but in fact of all mankind.</p>

                <p>13793. Pass Secretary’s party only from <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName>. Subject: Meeting With <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>.</p>
                <p>1. (Secret—Entire text.)</p>
                <p>2. Following is a fairly full account (to be compared with Krimer’s notes) of the
                    half-hour meeting with <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> held
                    between 4:30 and 5:00 p.m. on November 15, 1982. Those present on the Soviet
                    side were: General Secretary <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>,
                    Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, Foreign Policy
                    Politburo Aide Alexandrov and Interpreter Viktor Sukhodrov. On the U.S. side
                    were: Vice President <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName>, Secretary of
                    State <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName>, Interpreter Bill Krimer. The meeting
                    took place in one of the state reception rooms of the old Kremlin Palace. After
                    an exchange of handshakes, greetings and some photography, each group sat on the
                    opposite side of a long table.</p>
                <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> read from a prepared text with
                    some extemporaneous interpolations to amplify his own thinking. He began by
                    expressing the appreciation of himself and his colleagues and the Soviet people
                    for the expressions of condolences from the American people and particularly for
                    the mark of respect by the American people in sending such a distinguished
                    delegation. He said that it had not gone unnoticed that President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> had said that it was our policy to work
                    toward improved relations. He said, “We have taken note of this statement and
                    can say to you that our intentions are analogous.” <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> continued that he had already had the occasion to state
                    in the Central Committee meeting and at today’s ceremonies that the new
                    leadership’s line will be the same as under President <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>. The Soviet Union has had a consistent
                    and principled policy and they are following the line of equality,
                    non-interference and the seeking of peaceful relations. But, he went on, “sin
                    will out.” It is fair to say that our U.S.-Soviet relations are in a complex
                    condition. It was not the Soviets, he said, who took the initiative to worsen
                    relations. In fact, the Soviets displayed great restraint in the face of what
                    has appeared at times to be provocation. We have exercised this restraint not
                    because we are unsure of ourselves or weak, but because we believe confrontation
                    is senseless and won’t get anywhere.</p>
                <pb n="790" facs="0821" xml:id="pg_790"/>
                <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> went on to say that he would
                    like to draw the attention of his American guests to the fact that it was due to
                    U.S. actions that “We have almost fully squandered agreements that insured us
                    against surprises.” He said that if this erosion of the productive layer of our
                    relations should continue, he was sure it would lead to catastrophe and it was,
                    therefore, necessary to rebuild our relations.</p>
                <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> went on to say that he
                    understood we could not just pledge in words, but instead we must find ways to
                    show by deeds how we can stop the arms race and reach agreements on strategic
                    weapons and intermediate missiles in Europe that will be mutually acceptable and
                    based on the principles of equality and equal security. He then interpolated and
                    said that there is no other way; “If we continue, you will continue the arms
                    build up, and we will, and where will it all end? We all have sufficient
                    experience and sophistication. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                    and <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> understand these things well.
                    It would be a mistake on both sides if either one comes in with a position which
                    is so different that negotiation becomes impossible.” He then added to the text
                    that we can always debate and quarrel with each other in the press, but in the
                    end we must talk to each other in a sober-minded and normal way. He said, “There
                    is a true lack, and we must admit this, of mutual trust. Confidence has been
                    undermined primarily because acceptable standards have not been followed. You
                    have been interfering in the internal affairs, and teaching others to do so, of
                    other states. No one has the right to impose his standards or to dictate his
                    policy view of the world.” He then went on to point out that Soviet leaders were
                    dedicated to a broad, active dialogue between us and, indeed, between all
                    countries. He made an appeal for business-like discussions that would broaden
                    the range of contacts between us. He called for exchanges, negotiation and
                    consultation. He said it was important to give practical content to our
                    relationship and that he hoped this would lead to good and stable relations. He
                    said the result would heal this bad climate.</p>
                <p>6. He then added at the end of his statement that he trusted we would excuse his
                    raising these frank points on perhaps not the most auspicious occasion, “when
                    you have shown such good will by coming to express sympathy with us. But,” he
                    said, “I felt it was important that I should take this occasion to express to
                    you directly so that you could pass on this expression to your President, which
                    is the feeling for the mood of our leaders and people. We want good relations.
                    We want the best relations, but these always must be based on real rights and
                    interests.” With his only spark of humor in the conversation, he said that
                        <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> were probably steeled to exchanging
                    harsh words, but looking at Vice President <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName>, he said, “we are men of peace and, therefore, it is
                    important that we express our thoughts <pb n="791" facs="0822" xml:id="pg_791"/>frankly to one another.” He said he felt it was important that he should
                    express his thoughts and hoped that his “little speech” would have a good
                    effect.</p>
                <p>7. He again extended the wishes of the leadership for the success and health of
                    President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> and, once again,
                    expressed his thanks for the condolences and, most particularly, for the
                    President’s personal visit to the Soviet Embassy.</p>
                <p>8. The Vice President once again expressed his condolences and those of the
                    President and said that he and the Secretary very much appreciated the
                    courtesies that had been extended both here and in Washington. He said, with a
                    smile, that he felt he really knew Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> quite well since in the past they had shared some of
                    the same tasks. He said, “Hopefully, this gives a basis on which to have a
                    discussion.” The Vice President said that when <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Bill
                        Clark</persName> took over his new functions, he had invited Ambassador
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> to his house for dinner. In
                    the conversation that evening, the Vice President asked <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> to be frank in saying what disturbed
                    him about American policy and that he would be equally frank in telling
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> what was wrong from the U.S.
                    point of view with Soviet policy. He said he recognized that there was not time
                    to go into great detail on these matters today, but that he had listed for
                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> Afghanistan, Poland,
                    the treatment of human rights issues according to international norms and
                    several other important issues. He said we had no intent to interfere in the
                    internal affairs of others, but we feel very strongly about these issues. “We
                    are committed to maintaining our military strength at a level adequate for our
                    security, but we are not interested in an arms race. We believe we share a
                    commitment for the need for fruitful talks, but we believe these must be, in the
                    arms control field, based on verifiable agreements which provide for real
                    reductions in arms. The Vice President said that the President is deadly serious
                    on this issue. “We have cited some areas where we think change is possible and
                    we will respond positively to any positive change. We believe in the objective
                    of discussions and peace through negotiations. You have said that you have acted
                    with restraint in the face of what you think have been hostile actions. Time
                    doesn’t allow me to develop these points or to rebut your contentions, and I
                    suppose we could add our own list, but we feel it’s possible to make
                    progress.”</p>
                <p>9. The Vice President ended by saying that no one could help but be moved by the
                    sight of those young men on Red Square today. He said he had four sons and these
                    thoughts stress for him the need for the Geneva negotiations to bear fruit. The
                    Vice President ended by thanking the General Secretary and expressing once again
                    our readiness to do our part.</p>
                <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> ended by thanking the Vice
                    President once again, saying that he hoped ways would be found to continue
                    discussions <pb n="792" facs="0823" xml:id="pg_792"/>and get into details. He
                    said, “You have your perspective and we have ours. It’s necessary to sit down
                    and talk. We can’t do it now, but we should find ways to do this.” He asked to
                    have his greetings sent once again to President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> and his assurance that the whole Soviet leadership wished
                    to strengthen our relations.</p>
                <p>11. Comment: <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> appeared to me to be
                    more fit, although quite stooped, than he had at the November 7 reception, and
                    this despite all his strenuous activities of the past few days. <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> is clearly in charge. With no title
                    except General Secretary and perhaps chairman of the funeral committee, he
                    received the most senior delegation heads. There were a number of signs of
                    special gesture toward the United States and although his words had a tough
                    ring, they were said with an openness and directness that had a certain appeal.
                    For the first time in years, the Soviet Union appears to have firm, dynamic, but
                    tough leadership. <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> did not appear
                    to me to sound or act as though the mantle of power had just descended on his
                    shoulders. He talked as though he has been exercising power for some time and
                    that he has reached some understanding with his colleagues so that they accept
                    his position as leader. One interesting footnote was the presence of Alexandrov,
                    who was <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s foreign policy
                    advisor. I had seen him the other day at the reception and found him weighed
                    down with the cares of office and perhaps worries about his boss’s health. Today
                    he was almost glowing as he carefully noted any additions which his new leader
                    made to the statement which he had obviously prepared. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> too appeared at ease with <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>, although he wore his serious face
                    with his mouth very carefully tilted downward, which always indicates that the
                    news being given is not all pleasant tidings.</p>
                <p>12. It will be interesting to compare notes with the Germans, for example, who
                    saw him just after us, to see if there are any special messages for Europe as
                    distinct from the U.S.</p>
                <p>13. When you have Secretary-approved text, Vice President asked to have copy sent
                    to his party.</p>

                    for the President.</p>
                <p>1. Confidential—Entire text.</p>
                <p>2. Just before leaving for the airport following our meeting with <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George</persName> and Barbara Bush and I had the sad and sobering
                    experience of meeting with the six Pentecostalist family members living in our
                    Moscow Embassy. As you know, we have been giving the Pentecostalists refuge
                    since June 1978 because the Soviets insist they must return to Siberia before
                    their emigration applications will be considered. They wish to leave the Soviet
                    Union directly because their previous applications have brought them only
                    persecution.</p>
                <p>3. The six family members seemed touched by our unexpected visit. It gave them
                    the chance to give us the letters they had prepared to send us on the occasion
                    of our stay in Moscow, and they were generous in their praise of U.S. help and
                    our efforts to help them emigrate. During our chat, <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George</persName> and I expressed the hope that the time
                    will soon come when they can leave and be free to practice their religion as
                    they wish, without encouraging unrealistic expectations on their part.</p>
                <p>4. We did not publicize the visit beforehand, but it did come on the heels of our
                    talk with <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>, and I doubt the
                    Soviets will miss the clear signal of your deep commitment to the cause of human
                    rights in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>

                </list>
                <p>1. Mr. President, <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George Shultz</persName> will
                    brief you verbally on our Moscow visit, but I wanted to pass along a couple of
                    thoughts.</p>
                <p>2. I am glad you sent us. The Soviets clearly appreciated the gesture and shared
                    their appreciation in several ways.</p>
                <p>3. By way of example: <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George Shultz</persName> and I
                    walked to the receiving hall. Took off our coats, and went to the rear of the
                    line. When we were halfway up the stairs walking along with the likes of
                    President Zia, Prime Minister Suzuki and many more, a Soviet protocol officer
                    pushed through the crowd on the stairs and told us to come forward. Reluctantly
                    we obliged, being led obtusively past all the waiting dignitaries. We were
                    installed at the head of the line just in front of Prime Minister Trudeau. This
                    was all done in front of a large <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> camera pool.
                    We then greeted <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>, Tikinov, and
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, all of whom thanked us
                    profusely for coming and asking that we convey their sincere thanks to you.</p>
                <p>4. There were other little gestures, but the major event was our meeting at 4:30
                    p.m. with <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. Soviet watchers were amazed that
                        <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> received us.</p>
                <p>5. I will not report here on the conversation. A verbatim report is being
                        prepared,<note n="2" xml:id="d237fn2">See <ref target="#d234">Document
                            234</ref>.</note> but since this was the first known visit with
                        <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> by Americans, let me convey
                    some impressions.</p>
                <p>6. He seemed sure of himself. He read his three-page brief but with ease and
                    self-assurance.</p>
                <p>7. He conveyed strength, but not in a bellicose way.</p>
                <p>8. He dished it out, but did not flinch as I mentioned Poland, Afghanistan, and
                    human rights.</p>
                <p>9. He smiled and seemed genuinely warm when I made joking reference to his having
                    been <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> chief while I was head of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
                <pb n="795" facs="0826" xml:id="pg_795"/>
                <p>10. It is of course too early to predict how things will evolve in Moscow, but
                    for some reason I feel up-beat. Opportunity may well lie ahead, though much of
                    the rhetoric was predictable and accusatory.</p>
                <p>11. I am writing this cable as we fly Moscow to Frankfurt—a Soviet navigator up
                    front in the cockpit; the impressions of Red Square and the pageantry of
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s funeral fresh in my
                    mind.</p>
                <p>12. We were very close to the front. When the goose-stepping, arm-swinging, elite
                    guard marched in I at first saw only hostile troops and hostile power. We had a
                    little wait and I watched the changing of the guard and looked at the faces and
                    then I saw my sons and yours: <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George</persName>,
                    Jeb, Neil, Marvin, Mike and Ron.</p>
                <p>13. I saw a funeral without tears, save for the immediate family. I saw a funeral
                    without God and thought “how sad—how lonely.”</p>
                <p>14. I can’t speak for <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George Shultz</persName> with
                    whom it was a total joy sharing these responsibilities, but let me say two
                    things now: First, thanks for sending us on an unforgettable mission. Second: we
                    must succeed in our quest for peace.</p>
                <p>15. Now back to Africa. Warm regards,</p>

                <p>It is much too early to tell which way <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> will direct Soviet policies. He is by instinct and
                    experience a policeman; there is nothing in his background to indicate any
                    liberal tendencies. Indeed, compared to him, his defeated rival, <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName>, is almost a moderate. However,
                        <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> faces immense problems and
                    his decisions may be inspired <pb n="796" facs="0827" xml:id="pg_796"/>less by
                    what he wants to do than by what he must do. I believe that the following are
                    his immediate goals:</p>
                <p>—To restore in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> a sense of strong
                    leadership which has been missing for a year: in this respect, Western
                    conciliatory moves over the past week have been very helpful and are appreciated
                    by him.</p>
                <p>—To stem the psychological onslaught on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Communism launched by President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>, and, in particular, to put an end to
                    the idea that the West has any leverage inside the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> over the economic or political actions of the Soviet
                    Government. (Note that in his talk with Vice President <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> the “most forceful” presentation
                    concerned “interference in internal Soviet affairs”. They are hurting from our
                    economic and “democratization” offensives.)</p>
                <p>—To stop or at least reduce internal corruption and consumerism which makes it
                    difficult to control the population.</p>
                <p>—To derail the U.S. defense programs which face the Soviet leadership with
                    formidable technical and budgetary problems.</p>
                <p>—To repress and isolate the dissident movement in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                <p>These priorities are fairly clear. What <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> may do beyond that remains to be seen. In particular,
                    his views on economic reform are unknown—it is quite uncertain whether he will
                    turn toward greater self-reliance and harsh punitive measures to improve
                    productivity, or, on the contrary, take the path of moderate reform and rely on
                    incentives.</p>
                <p>A good case can be made that we have gone as far as we should for the time being
                    in our good-will gestures toward the man, and ought now to await further
                    significant conciliatory gestures from Moscow.</p>

                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Tom Simons</persName> gave me an oral brief on the
                    Vice President and Secretary’s meeting with <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>:</p>
                <pb n="797" facs="0828" xml:id="pg_797"/>
                <p>• <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> read from a script <hi rend="italic">but</hi> he did not slavishly follow it. He was at ease with
                    the material.</p>
                <p>• <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> (or the VP) characterized
                        <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> as unyielding on substance,
                    but “positive” and procedurally inviting”.</p>
                <p>• <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> started by expressing
                    appreciation for the respect we showed <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> and the rank of our delegation.</p>
                <p>• He said that the President’s statements about desiring better relations had not
                    gone unnoticed.</p>
                <p>• The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> desired the peaceful development of
                    relations. The international situation was complex. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was showing restraint, but the US should be
                    under no illusion regarding its strength.</p>
                <p>• US actions have squandered the reserve of good will from the detente period.
                    It’s important to maintain stability in US–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> relations.</p>
                <p>• Erosion in relations should not be allowed to continue.</p>
                <p>• More than verbal promises are needed to improve relations.</p>
                <p>• It is desirable to halt the arms race spiral in a way that won’t prejudice
                    either side’s interests, and on the basis of equality, non-interference and
                    mutual advantage.</p>
                <p>• Both sides should refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of the
                    other. We have different standards, (for internal behavior, presumably) and they
                    should be respected. (<persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> said that
                        <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> showed the most passion on
                    the question of non-interference in internal affairs.)</p>
                <p>To me, from the brief run-down, the most interesting aspect is <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s raising the question of
                    interference. The Soviets are enormously sensitive on this subject, and they
                    have gotten the message from the President’s democratization effort. That’s not
                    surprising. What is surprising is that <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> would be so clearly willing to express their
                    sensitivity and—we might guess, their vulnerability—on this issue. We have not
                    heard the last of this, particularly as we move ahead on Soviet minorities
                    programs, etc.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> told me that it may be a while
                    before a <gloss target="#t_memcon_1">Memcon</gloss> is finally approved.
                    Apparently there is some back and forth with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> on what to say in the memorandum about
                    the Vice President’s remarks. I got the impression that the Vice President may
                    have misspoken, but that is only conjecture. I would guess that there is
                    probably some sensitivity, particularly at the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> over the Vice President’s fairly positive remarks in Moscow.
                    Note that he had described <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> as a
                    prominent world “leader”. The word leader had been explicitly changed to
                    “figure” in the official letter of condolence.</p>

                        Regarding His Meeting with <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Yuri
                            Andropov</persName>
                  </item>
                </list>
                <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> introduced and “dismissed” the other
                    key Soviet officials and evidenced himself as being very much in charge as he
                    spoke at <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s funeral. He appeared
                    adroit—with the facility to react at a moment’s notice. The Secretary had the
                    feeling that <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> could escalate a
                    situation very quickly and “take us on.”</p>
                <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> was very good at disinformation and
                    misrepresented the context of <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s
                    meeting with the Americans when he spoke to the Germans a few hours later.
                        <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> said the Americans met
                        <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> at 10:00 a.m. and the
                    Germans at 5:30 p.m. During the conversation with the Americans he appeared in a
                    friendly manner. However, with the Germans, according to the information
                    reaching <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>, the tone was
                    threatening; he read from a script; and laid it on the line to the Germans on
                    how he saw things.</p>
                <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> showed that he understood some
                    English. When Vice President <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName> was
                    speaking he evidenced an understanding of what he was saying. Parenthetically
                        <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> claims that <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> understands English but he never heard
                    him speak it and he certainly never spoke it to <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>.</p>
                <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> seemed vigorous, complexion
                    somewhat pale but eyes steely—basically a quiet, unrevealing expression as
                    compared to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> who was very
                    expressive facially. <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> noted that
                    the Americans had a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>
                    shortly after he shook some 2,000 hands but he still had a great deal of energy
                    about him. He apparently has a very easy and relaxed relationship with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and the two occasionally whispered and
                    laughed between them. It was obvious to <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was
                    on excellent terms with <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>. At one
                    point when the Vice President spoke of himself and <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> having had the same jobs in intelligence, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> replied, “yes, we are men of peace but
                    they (referring to <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>) are the men of problems.”</p>
                <pb n="799" facs="0830" xml:id="pg_799"/>
                <p>5. The Secretary said there was no question in his mind but that <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> was completely in charge—nothing
                    collective about the situation at all. It also appeared obvious that he has been
                    running things for some time and not just grabbing the baton upon the death of
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>.</p>

                <p>I had a very interesting lunch today with Cyrus Vance and his family, who were
                    here for the unveiling of his portrait. <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George
                        Shultz</persName> was unable to be present at the lunch, although he was
                    present just before lunch and was there again for the unveiling. It gave me an
                    opportunity to have some impression of Vance’s personality. He came through as
                    stronger than I had been led to believe by the media, but at the same time, he
                    did not seem as multi-faceted as I suspected that he might be. He is very much a
                    public person—a slow, deliberate, balanced figure on all occasions. I see in
                    him, deeply etched, the senior Wall Street corporate partner, as well as the
                    experienced man of foreign affairs. I liked him very much, as I gather all
                    people who have dealt with him have liked him.</p>
                <p>We had a long meeting this afternoon at 6 o’clock concerning a question involving
                    negotiations with the union over senior Foreign Service performance pay. What
                    was interesting about it was not the details about bonus systems but rather the
                    Secretary’s great interest in improving the management of the Department. An
                    entire hour was spent on the subject, and the Secretary probed very deeply into
                    the way in which bonus systems work and should work.</p>
                <p>Somewhat earlier, at 5:15, we had a meeting called a Pre-Brief for a lunch that
                    the Secretary is having tomorrow with Soviet Ambassador <pb n="800" facs="0831" xml:id="pg_800"/>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d241fn2">In a note he dictated on November 23, <persName corresp="#p_DKW_1">Dam</persName> added: “The Secretary met with
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> today. The
                        meeting was the result of a conversation at a reception that the Secretary
                        and <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> had several weeks ago,
                        but the actual date was not set until after the Secretary returned from the
                            <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> funeral. I would suspect
                        that the fact of the lunch will get a considerable amount of press play. I
                        heard some of the de-briefing of the Secretary by the staff. Apparently it
                        was a business-like lunch which might lead to closer contacts and more
                        comprehensive discussion, but nothing at all definitive came out of it. It
                        seems likely that the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> will not meet again until close to Christmas
                        because of the Secretary’s travel schedule, and the meeting may not even
                        occur then because of <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s
                        return at Christmas to the Soviet Union.” (Department of State, Executive

                    turned into a discussion of what our policy toward the Soviet Union should be in
                    this period of change just after General Secretary <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> has come to power. Obviously everyone fears that the
                    public euphoria over a possible looser situation in the Soviet Union will lead
                    us toward short-sighted measures. One element in this appears to be <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s willingness, perhaps a result of his
                    experience with disinformation as the head of the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>, to try to manipulate U.S. opinion and the opinion of other
                    countries through planted messages and signals.</p>
                <p>For example, William Verity, the head of the U.S.–U.S.S.R. Commercial Commission,
                    came back with what he thought was a message, which was a series of Soviet
                    suggestions that they were ready for a summit. They were interested in whether
                    he would be speaking to the President. This led Verity into great enthusiasm,
                    apparently, about the prospects of a move toward detente and greatly expanded
                    U.S. commercial relations wih the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>Similarly, it is quite apparent that <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> distorted the conversation that he had with Vice
                    President <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName> in a subsequent
                    conversation with President Carstens of West Germany. Essentially <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> told Carstens that <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName> had linked Soviet policy in Afghanistan
                    and Poland to our position on the missile deployments in Europe. Quite to the
                    contrary, <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName> had simply made the
                    point that our relationship with the Soviet Union would depend upon the actual
                    actions that the Soviet Union took. Our position is that we believe the missile
                    deployments are needed to offset the effects of the Soviet SS–20. Obviously
                        <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> is trying either to browbeat
                    the Germans or to find some formula by which he could eliminate the threat of
                    new U.S. missile deployments without in any way affecting the existing Russian
                    SS–20 deployments.</p>

                    dinner being given for us by Ambassador and Mrs. Jacovides of the Cyprus
                    Embassy.</p>

                <p>1. Our arms control negotiators in <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> and
                    INF see the Soviet delegations as stonewalling with Moscow likely, at some time
                    soon in INF, to put out an unacceptable but publicly appealing offer and then
                    launch a propaganda barrage to blame American inflexibility for failure of the
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>2. They are insisting that aircraft must be included, <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and French systems must be taken into account, and there should
                    be no restraints on Soviet Far Eastern deployment. Soviet attempts to introduce
                    aircraft in the negotiations are aimed at emasculating US support for its
                    allies; there can be no compensation for <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and
                    French systems; and if SS–20s were moved to the Far East, they could be easily
                    moved back.</p>
                <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NPH_1">Nitze</persName> speculates that the new Soviet
                    proposal would likely call for 200 intermediate range missiles on each side,
                    including <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and French systems, and 100
                    bombers. The Soviets now have 200 SS–20s west of the crest of the Urals, thus
                    they could dismantle their obsolete SS–4s and 5s and not have to destroy a
                    single SS–20. Obsolete badgers and blinders could be moved or destroyed, and
                    excess Backfire could be moved east of the Urals. We should be prepared for a
                    leak or other announcement of this proposal.</p>
                <p>4. To deal with this we need full consultation with the Allies at each step in
                    the negotiations in order to present a united front against the anticipated
                    Soviet campaign. If the US is going to ask for on-site inspection the Allies
                    must be consulted in advance because they have their own laws to contend with.
                    The Allies are well aware of what the Soviets are up to.</p>
                <p>5. It is most likely that the Soviets are readying a full propaganda campaign to
                    discredit the US proposal. To counter this, we need a public information
                    campaign reiterating our position, laying out the issues and the negotiating
                    record frankly, the disparity in forces, etc. The President’s speech Monday
                    provides the basis for this. <persName corresp="#p_NPH_1">Nitze</persName> urges
                    that his confidentiality arrangement with the head of the Soviet delega<pb n="802" facs="0833" xml:id="pg_802"/>tion not be allowed to hinder higher US
                    Government and any available Allied officials exploiting the extremity, lack of
                    logic, and general nastiness of the Soviet Union in its INF position.</p>
                <p>6. Fortunately, <gloss target="#t_SHAPE_1">SHAPE</gloss> is mounting an
                    information program to be conducted with contingents of officers going to public
                    meetings in Europe to explain INF issues. This should be supplemented by
                    mobilizing US Ambassadors and other ranking officials in Europe as spokesmen. To
                    make this effective, General Lawson, Chief of Staff, <gloss target="#t_SHAPE_1">SHAPE</gloss>, urged that photography be released for public inspection. I
                    have had this issue reviewed once again and the conclusion is the same as it was
                    in response to an asserted need for photography to support <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II in 1979 and to support INF deployment in
                    1981. The threat to the protection of sources and methods outweighs the somewhat
                    doubtful persuasive value of revealing to the public even degraded satellite
                    imagery of selected Soviet INF hardware. The <persName corresp="#p_IBR_1">Inman</persName>-Hughes display of airplane photography of Nicaragua this
                    spring had little if any impact on public opinion. The <persName corresp="#p_KRT_1">Kennedy</persName> photos on Cuban missiles were
                    meaningful because they were taken from U–2 planes at an altitude of 500 feet.
                    Our satellite photos are meaningful only to a trained interpreter. Releases will
                    inevitably make less effective the collection of these imaging systems and trade
                    possible, and I think unlikely, short-term political/military gains for
                    long-term degradation of our critical information gathering capacities.
                    Actually, there is no widespread doubt in Europe that SS–20s are there and
                    photography doesn’t convey the spread of deployment or broad purpose. We believe
                    that preparation of a public document with careful renderings of SS–20
                    facilities and equipment similar to the Secretary of Defense’s <hi rend="italic">Soviet Military Power</hi> is the best way to develop public understanding
                    of the Soviet developments.</p>
                <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_NPH_1">Nitze</persName> urges that we make every effort
                    to make a further offer, which should be complete and not piecemeal, or, if that
                    is deemed not to be desirable, to explore all reasonable alternatives in order
                    to provide Kohl with ammunition to win the potential political battle over
                    deployment.</p>
                <p>8. Substantial research and policy determinations in both INF and <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> are necessary as a prerequisite to this.
                    The Soviet delegation is paranoid on cruise missiles, viewing the combination of
                    bombers and cruise missiles—with either or both using Stealth technology—as the
                    upcoming first strike threat. Aborting the cruise missile may be their primary
                    objective in the current round of negotiations, as aborting <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> was in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                    I. The cruise missile may have great strategic value for us in countering a
                    conventional move where the Soviets have logistical advantages as in the Persian
                    Gulf. At the same time, the Soviets probably perceive less military value in the
                    modern cruise missile for <pb n="803" facs="0834" xml:id="pg_803"/>them than for
                    the US. They need cruise missiles less than we do; they depend less on bombers
                    for intercontinental missions, and they already have a powerful ballistic
                    missile force on land and at sea. They are threatening us, we believe, with
                    deployment of sea-launched cruise missiles on submarines off the US coast—and
                    perhaps other actions as well—to reciprocate for our planned deployment of
                    Pershing II in Europe, and they may deploy cruise missiles as early as next year
                    for primarily political purposes. A requirement to protect against US cruise
                    missiles would greatly stretch their resources. So, we need a net assessment of
                    our interest in cruise missiles.</p>
                <p>9. There are additional requirements to complete the <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> picture from a monitoring/verification point of view:</p>
                <p>—Advice is needed on how to deal with denial of flight test data. There is a view
                    that we need to encrypt terminal guidance telemetry to keep the Soviets from
                    jamming our guidance mechanisms. That will be hard to negotiate and they can get
                    our guidance structure from sources other than telemetry while we can’t. So, it
                    may be more important to maintain access to Soviet telemetry than to deny them
                    our guidance data, a denial that may be temporary.</p>
                <p>—If mobile <gloss target="#t_ICBM_1">ICBMs</gloss> are permitted in <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>, how will they be monitored?</p>
                <p>—If and when cruise missiles are on the table, how will they be dealt with to
                    include <gloss target="#t_SLCM_1">SLCMs</gloss> and conventional vs. nuclear
                    armed cruise missiles?</p>
                <p>—Some of our reconstitution proposals are unverifiable, how are they to be
                    handled?</p>
                <p>—The warhead counting rules also contain monitoring and verification
                    problems.</p>
                <p>10. Ambassador Ellis at the Special Consultative Committee has two issues of
                    concern to him, the <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> Treaty review and the
                    SS–16 issue. He expressed dismay with the attitude of holding the <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> Treaty review hostage to resolution of other
                    issues. He pointed out that the Soviets are building a good case for a
                    presentation on poor US performance towards the Treaty review. The Soviets have
                    already told him twice that they thought the US was stalling on beginning the
                    review. This would strengthen a Soviet claim that the US is stalling in <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> and INF. Ellis has detailed instructions
                    on how to conduct the Treaty review and wants a firm determination that he can
                    carry out that review in a business-like way. He emphasized that we can amend
                    the <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> Treaty at any time to take account of
                    future US plans regarding MX and BMD. On the SS–16 issue, Ellis urged that we
                    should carefully consider how we return to the issue before any precipitous
                    action. He believes that it is not wise to tell the Soviets directly that
                    satisfactory <pb n="804" facs="0835" xml:id="pg_804"/>resolution of the SS–16
                    issue is an official precondition to the beginning of the <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> Treaty review. He thinks it was correct to
                    bring the issue up, but that we should realize that we may not get any further
                    response from them.</p>

                <p>The Department of State has sent the attached analysis (Tab I) of <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s address of November 22. The turgid
                    document concludes that “the speech does not reveal any shift in specific Soviet
                    policies or in Moscow’s overall approach to East-West relations”. This is true
                    as far as it goes except that there are in the speech some interesting nuances
                    which deserve notice:</p>
                <p>—The emphasis is on the need for economic reform, with strong hints it should
                    follow the Hungarian model.</p>
                <p>—The emphasis on Soviet relations with Asian countries (China and India, above
                    all) which suggests a possible drive to attain <hi rend="italic">detente</hi> in
                    Asia in order to be better able to face the American “threat”.</p>

                     <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s speech at the plenum of the
                        <gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss> Central Committee November 22 is a
                    shrewd effort to capitalize on the positive atmosphere and rising international
                    expectations surrounding the succession. The speech also provided him an
                    opportunity to put his own personal stamp on the tone, if not yet the substance,
                    of post-<persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> Soviet foreign
                    policy.</p>
                  <p>The essence of this new tone is to convey a greater sense of Soviet flexibility
                    and reasonableness through verbal moderation, without making any concessions on
                    substantive issues. By so doing, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>
                    intends to reassure his domestic constituencies of the continuity of Soviet
                    foreign policy; provide further momentum to an improvement in Moscow’s relations
                    with the Third World, China and Western Europe; and place the U.S. on the
                    defensive, thus maneuvering Washington closer to an arms control-centered
                    relationship similar to detente.</p>
                  <p>
                     <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> begins his speech by reassuring
                    the <gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss>, the Soviet military, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s allies and friends that Soviet foreign
                    policy will continue to pursue the line set out by his predecessor; that the
                    Soviet armed forces will continue to receive “everything necessary;” and that
                    Moscow will vigorously pursue development of relations with like-minded
                    Socialist nations. Following up on the fence-mending begun during the <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> funeral, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> then makes a direct appeal for improvement of Soviet
                    relations with “our great neighbor” China, the Third World (with special mention
                    of India), and Western Europe.</p>
                  <p>The most striking element of the speech, however, is an explicit call for return
                    to the detente relationship of the 1970s, centering on arms control negotiations
                    with the United States and Western Europe. Declaring that “the future belongs to
                    this policy,” <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> calls for a
                    relationship based on “reciprocity and equality,” explicitly rejecting <pb n="806" facs="0837" xml:id="pg_806"/>linkage between normal U.S.-Soviet
                    bilateral relations and “some sort of preliminary concessions in different
                    fields.” By avoiding direct criticism of the U.S. by name or direct mention of
                    regional issues such as Afghanistan, Poland and Kampuchea, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> conveys moderation to West European
                    ears and relegates Soviet international behavior to a category beyond serious
                    mention.</p>
                  <p>In this way, he sets the stage to emphasize the issue which he wishes to be the
                    litmus test of East-West relations: arms control. On this issue, he takes care
                    to strike a measured and moderate tone, asserting that the Soviets want neither
                    “the dispute of ideas to grow into a confrontation of states” nor “arms . . . to
                    become a gauge of the potentials of social systems.” He stresses a desire for
                    both nuclear and conventional arms negotiations and implicitly criticizes the
                    U.S. position by condemning “talks for the sake of talks” and mere restatements
                    of existing differences. He refrains, however, from the sort of explicit
                    criticism of U.S. motives and proposals that other Soviet spokesmen have
                    advanced in recent weeks. Several times he says that any agreement must reflect
                    “the interests of both sides,” but quickly qualifies this with the warning that
                    no one should expect unilateral disarmament from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. He concludes by repeating <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s call for a freeze on strategic arsenals as a first
                    step to a <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> agreement.</p>
                  <p>The speech does not reveal any shift in specific Soviet policies or in Moscow’s
                    overall approach to East-West relations. It does, however, represent a tactical
                    refinement in the way the new leadership intends to pursue familiar objectives.
                    Many of these tactical adjustments were evident during the last year of the
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> period—and may indeed have
                    been inspired by the <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> ascendancy
                    then taking place—but we can expect them to be accelerated now that <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> has taken over in his own right. Thus,
                    the playing up of potential U.S.-European differences on East-West relations and
                    the encouragement of the Western nuclear freeze movement may now be reinforced
                    by a more direct appeal to the nostalgia for detente. This may be supported by
                    an attempt to subordinate regional issues, and thus linkage, by muting the
                    rhetorical battle over these issues. The Soviets also may hope to dissipate
                    international resistance to their goals in Afghanistan, Poland and Kampuchea by
                    talking compromise and openly courting the nations (China, Pakistan, the West
                    Europeans) whose support we need to maintain pressure for Soviet concessions.
                    The new leadership probably hopes, in turn, that all these developments will
                    increase pressures on Washington to reduce its demands for an overall bilateral
                    improvement and to acquiesce in Moscow’s desire to place arms control at the
                    center of U.S.-Soviet relations.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Leadership Developments</p>
                <p>The Central Committee met in plenary session on November 22, and three changes in
                    the leadership were announced. As expected, Andrey Kirilenko was dropped from
                    the Politburo, ostensibly for reasons of health. Geydar Aliyev, Azerbaijan’s
                    party chief, was named to full membership in the Politburo. Aliyev has long been
                    considered a supporter of <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Konstantin
                        Chernenko</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s
                    primary rival in the succession struggle. However, the intelligence community
                    now believes that Aliyev’s associations with <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> may be even closer, since Aliyev was a <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> man before he gained the top Party spot in
                    Azerbaijan in 1969. Aliyev may thus represent a compromise choice suitable to
                    both <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> supporters.</p>
                <p>Central Committee member Nikolay Ryzhkov was named to replace <persName corresp="#p_KAP_1">Kirilenko</persName> as one of the Central Committee
                    Secretaries. It is not known what responsibilities Ryzhkov will assume, although
                    his background is in heavy industry. It should be noted also that 83-year-old
                    Politburo member Arvid Pel’she did show up at the plenum, thus scotching reports
                    he had died during <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s funeral.
                    The total voting membership of the Politburo now stands at twelve, which is a
                    little low, historically. If <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>
                    already has a working majority, keeping the Politburo small may suit his
                    interests, at least until he can move his own men up through the ranks and into
                    the Politburo. It may also indicate, however, that there is still disagreement
                    within the Politburo over who to promote to bring the voting membership up to
                    its more normal level of 13–14 persons.</p>
                <p>At the November 23 meeting of the Supreme Soviet, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> was elected to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.
                        <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName> had been mentioned by many sources
                    as possible alternatives to <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> as
                    the new Chairman of the Supreme Soviet. However, since neither of them is on the
                    Presidium of that body, the odds are very strong now that <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> will be elected to the Chairmanship
                        <pb n="808" facs="0839" xml:id="pg_808"/>on November 24. If this occurs, it
                    will mean that <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> will have done in
                    the space of only a few days what it took his predecessor, <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Leonid Brezhnev</persName>, nearly thirteen years to
                    accomplish: he will simultaneously hold both the head of Party and head of State
                    positions.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic Policy</p>
                <p>Contrary to press accounts, we read <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s November 22 Plenum speech on the economy as offering
                    only slight, though possibly revealing, shifts in nuances from recent <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> pronouncements. The new Soviet leader
                    set out an agenda of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s mounting
                    economic problems, but offered only tentative glimpses of his own preferences
                    for dealing with them. <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> did
                    suggest that he will favor the stick, rather than the carrot, as an economic
                    stimulus. He carefully refrained from promising miracles, confessing “I do not
                    have any ready recipes for solution” of the “many tasks” facing the ailing
                    economy. <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s remarks offered a
                    rhetorical valedictory to the <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                    years, but shed only the dimmest of light on the nation’s future path.
                    Specifically, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>:</p>
                <p>—Admitted that the economic news was bad, “emphatically” noting that production
                    plans had not been fulfilled over the past two years and acknowledging the
                    looming constraints on Soviet labor, raw material and energy supplies;</p>
                <p>—Acknowledged the importance of material incentives, but placed more emphasis
                    than his predecessor on the need for discipline in the economy, declaring that
                    “shoddy work, inactivity and irresponsibility should have an immediate and
                    unavoidable effect on the earnings, official status and moral prestige of
                    workers;”</p>
                <p>—Pledged to continue <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s commitment
                    to improving the living conditions of Soviet consumers, while distancing himself
                    personally by referring to it as this “question which Leonid Ilich thought
                    particularly important;” and</p>
                <p>—Called for more independence for Soviet industrial managers, particularly those
                    who “boldly introduce new technology,” and for importing successful managerial
                    techniques from abroad. However, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>
                    did not embrace the cause of economic reform too tightly, noting “it is
                    necessary to act with caution here.”</p>
                <p>Following <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s practice, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> also included a ritual pledge to
                    “provide the army and the navy with everything necessary.” Unlike his
                    predecessor, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> associated his
                    leadership colleagues with this policy which, he averred, “the Politburo
                    considers compulsory.”</p>

                <p>In his first meeting with <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George Shultz</persName>
                    since <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> had been named General
                    Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> cautiously explored
                    the ground without making any fresh promises or commitments. His instructions
                    seem to have been to learn at first hand how far the United States was prepared
                    to translate its friendly gestures toward the post-<persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> leadership into specific concessions. His main points
                    were:</p>
                <p>—That it might be desirable for you to meet with <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George</persName>’s
                    response to this suggestion was cool.</p>
                <p>—That no progress was being made in the Geneva arms talks and that the
                    negotiations might better be moved to “higher levels” (summit?). <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George</persName> replied that we had excellent
                    negotiators in Geneva.</p>
                <p>—That we were violating <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II with your MX
                    decision and “planning something ‛deceptive’ regarding the <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> Treaty”, which <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George</persName> firmly refuted.</p>
                <p>As had been their practice in the past, the Soviet side insists on excluding from
                    discussion all regional areas of conflict between us (Poland, Afghanistan,
                    Central America, Angola, etc.), in order to confine negotiations with us
                    exclusively to bilateral issues, essentially arms control and summit
                    conferences. In this respect, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s
                    accession to power has made no perceptive difference as yet.</p>

                    <item>My Luncheon with Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> November 23</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>As we agreed Tuesday morning,<note n="3" xml:id="d245fn3">November 23.</note> I
                    told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> that you are
                    totally committed to maintaining US strength, but are no less serious in your
                    willingness to work for a more constructive relationship with the Soviet Union.
                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> replied that the
                    Soviets also wanted a more constructive relationship and the question was how to
                    bring this about.</p>
                  <p>This led to a discussion of the issues, places and people involved. The issues, I
                    said, were on the agenda which Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and I identified in New York—arms control, regional
                    issues (Afghanistan, Kampuchea, etc.) and what I called “Madrid” issues (<gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> and human rights). We reviewed the various
                    settings for US-Soviet discussions: INF and <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> in Geneva, <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> in Vienna,
                        <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> in Madrid and the experts’ talks on
                    non-proliferation and Southern Africa currently being arranged. I noted that if
                    we are serious about the effort to improve relations, he and I should meet more
                    often. Equally, as it is important for the Soviet Government that <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> get a “feel” for us in high level
                    meetings, it is also important for the United States that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> have the opportunity to get a “feel”
                    for the Soviet leadership through regular access and exchanges. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> acknowledged this point. We discussed
                    the possibility of my meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> this spring, but agreed that such a meeting would depend
                    on the progress in our relations over the next several months.</p>
                  <p>
                     <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> raised the question of whether or
                    not “our bosses” should meet. He explained that in his last years <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> could give speeches and sign
                    documents, but not negotiate. This, however, was not the case with <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>. He asked if there were any point to a
                    get-acquainted meeting with you. I replied that there is no point to a meeting
                    for the sake of a meeting. What is needed is the prospect of forward movement on
                    problems between us. I agreed to explore the issue but basically, adhered to our
                    previous position on the summit question.</p>
                  <pb n="811" facs="0842" xml:id="pg_811"/>
                  <p>I raised with <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> the
                    misrepresentation of what the Vice President told <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> in <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s
                    account to the West Germans. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                    said he was puzzled and could not understand what had happened, but I am sure he
                    got the point.</p>
                  <p>There was a good deal of discussion about how to negotiate. In that context,
                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> noted that the
                    Soviets felt there had been no progress in Geneva. He said frankly that the
                    Soviet negotiators there were totally bound by their instructions and without
                    flexibility. He suggested that any progress on arms control would require a
                    political impulse from higher levels. He seemed to imply that we might need
                    another forum for the “real” negotiations. I replied that we have competent
                    personnel in Geneva who are prepared to negotiate. It was agreed, however, that
                    as the current round of negotiations was coming to an end, each side should
                    review the bidding with its negotiators when they returned to their respective
                    capitals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> complained that your M–X basing
                    decision was a violation of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty
                    and also suggested that we were planning something “deceptive” regarding the
                        <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> Treaty. I refuted <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>’s allegations about <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II and have instructed that we clarify and
                    correct any misperceptions on the <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> issue.
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> also asked where we planned
                    to discuss the <gloss target="#t_CBMs_1">CBMs</gloss> which you proposed. I
                    noted that we considered Geneva the appropriate forum. He agreed that Geneva was
                    appropriate for some of the measures but not for all, for example the hot line.
                    We agreed to discuss the issue further at a later date.</p>
                  <p>We concluded that each of us would discuss the broader subject of improved
                    relations within our governments in preparation for our next meeting. Ambassador
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> conveyed the feeling that if
                    there is some prospective movement, he was willing to do his best in support of
                    it. On balance, I think the discussion reinforced the central message I gave on
                    your behalf at the outset: we will remain strong, but are willing to work for
                    more constructive relations.</p>

                        SANCTIONS</hi> (U)</p>
                <p>I have reviewed the “Summary of Conclusions” of the consultations with our Allies
                    conducted by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> of which a
                    copy is attached. This framework agreement establishes the security-minded
                    principles that will govern East-West economic relations for the remainder of
                    this decade and beyond. In putting these principles into practice, the Allies
                    have committed themselves to immediate actions on the key elements of East-West
                    trade including: agreement not to sign or approve any new contracts for the
                    purchase of Soviet gas during the urgent study of Western energy alternatives;
                    agreement to strengthen the effectiveness of controls on high technology
                    transfer to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, including examination of
                    the necessity of multilateral controls on critical oil and gas equipment and
                    technology; and agreement to harmonize export credit policies. It is my goal
                    that firm allied commitments emerge from the studies in each of these major
                    categories in the next few months and that the resulting common policies will be
                    substantially agreed by the time of or before the Williamsburg Economic Summit
                    presently scheduled for May 1983. The principal objectives of the United States
                    during these studies are as follows: (S)</p>
                <p>1. An agreement that countries participating in the agreement will not commit to
                    any incremental deliveries of Soviet gas beyond the amounts contracted for from
                    the first strand of the Siberian pipeline; not commit themselves to significant
                    incremental deliveries through already existing pipeline capacity; and
                    participate in the accelerated development of alternative Western energy
                    resources, principally Norwegian gas reserves. To accomplish this objective, the
                    U.S. should undertake intensive work with our Allies and within the IEA/OECD to
                    encourage development of these Western alternatives and to encourage that
                    adequate safety net measures are adopted to protect against a shutoff of Soviet
                    gas. (S)</p>
                <p>2. An agreement to add critical technologies and equipment to the <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> list, harmonize national licensing
                    procedures for <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>, and substantially
                    improve the coordination and effectiveness of international enforcement efforts.
                    (S)</p>
                <pb n="813" facs="0844" xml:id="pg_813"/>
                <p>3. A quick agreement that allied security interests require controls on advanced
                    technology and equipment beyond the expanded <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> list, including equipment in the oil and gas sector;
                    development of a list of equipment in this category and an effective procedure
                    to control its transfer to the Soviet Union. (S)</p>
                <p>4. An agreement that builds on the recent <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss>
                    agreement substantially raising interest rates to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to achieve further restraints on officially-backed credits
                    such as higher downpayments, shortened maturities and an established framework
                    to monitor this process. (S)</p>

                    objectives emerging from the work program agreed in the “Summary of

                    and gas equipment and technology to the Soviet Union and the June 22 amendment
                    extending these controls to U.S. subsidiaries and licensees abroad. In addition,

                  </p>
                  <p>During conversations in Washington between the Secretary of State of the United
                    States of America and representatives of Canada, the Federal Republic of
                    Germany, France, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom on the subject of East-West
                    relations, in which representatives of the <gloss target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss>
                    participated, a certain number of conclusions have been reached on behalf of the
                    governments represented. The summary of these follows. (C)</p>
                  <p>1. They recognize the necessity of conducting their relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern Europe on the basis of a global
                    and comprehensive policy designed to serve their common fundamental security
                    interests. They are particularly conscious of the need that action in the
                    economic field be consistent with that global and comprehensive policy and thus
                    be based on a common approach. They are resolved together to take the necessary
                    steps to remove differences and to ensure that future decisions by their
                    governments on these issues are taken on the basis of an analysis of the
                    East-West relationship as a whole, with due regard for their respective
                    interests and in a spirit of mutual trust and confidence. (S)</p>

                  <p>2. The following criteria should govern the economic dealings of their countries
                    with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries:</p>
                  <p>—That they will not undertake trade arrangements, or take steps, which contribute
                    to the military or strategic advantage and capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                  <p>—That it is not in their interest to subsidize the Soviet economy; trade should
                    be conducted in a prudent manner without preferential treatment.</p>
                  <p>—That it is not their purpose to engage in economic warfare against the Soviet
                    Union. To be consistent with our broad security interests, trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> must proceed, <hi rend="italic">inter
                        alia</hi>, on the basis of a strict balance of advantages. (S)</p>
                  <p>It is agreed to examine thoroughly in the appropriate bodies how to apply these
                    criteria, taking into account the various economic and political problems
                    involved, with the view to agreeing on a common line of action in the spirit of
                    paragraph one and the above criteria. They will pay due attention in the course
                    of this work to the question of how best to tailor their economic relations with
                    Eastern European countries to the specific situation of each of them,
                    recognizing the different political and economic conditions that prevail in each
                    of these Eastern European countries. (S)</p>
                  <p>The overall analysis of economic relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the Eastern European countries will touch in particular on
                    the following areas:</p>
                  <quote>
                     <p>—Strategic goods and technology of military significance (<gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>);</p>

                    <p>—Agricultural products. (S)</p>
                  </quote>
                  <p>In their analysis of other high technology items, it is agreed to examine
                    immediately whether their security interests require controls, to be implemented
                    in an agreed and appropriate manner, on the export to the Soviet Union and
                    Eastern Europe of advanced technology and equipment to be jointly determined.
                    This immediate examination of whether their security interests require controls,
                    to be implemented in an agreed and appropriate manner, on the export to the
                    Soviet Union and Eastern Europe of advanced technology and equipment will
                    include technology and equipment with direct applications to the oil and gas
                    sector. (S)</p>
                  <p>In the field of energy, they will initiate a study of their projected energy
                    requirements and dependence upon imports over the next decade and beyond and
                    possible means of meeting these requirements, <pb n="816" facs="0847" xml:id="pg_816"/>with particular attention being given to the European
                    energy situation. The study will be conducted under the auspices of the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss>. (S)</p>
                  <p>3. As an immediate decision and following decisions already made, they have
                    further agreed on the following:</p>
                  <p>(a) Building on the conclusions of the High-Level Meeting, they will work
                    together within the framework of the Coordinating Committee (<gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>) to protect their contemporary security
                    interests: the list of strategic items will be evaluated and, if necessary,
                    adjusted. This objective will be pursued at the <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> Review now under way. They will take the necessary measures
                    to strengthen the effectiveness and responsiveness of <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> and to enhance their national mechanisms as necessary to
                    enforce <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> decisions. (S)</p>
                  <p>(b) It was agreed at Versailles that the development of economic and financial
                    relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe would be subject to periodic
                        <hi rend="italic">ex post</hi> review. The necessary procedures for this
                    purpose will be established without delay. Having in mind the criteria in
                    paragraph two above, they will work urgently further to harmonize export credit
                    policies. (S)</p>
                  <p>(c) They have informed each other that during the course of the study on energy
                    requirements, they will not sign, or approve the signing by their companies of,
                    new contracts with the Soviet Union for the purchase of natural gas. (S)</p>

                        Time?</item>
                </list>
                <p>A number of factors justify our asking ourselves whether or not the time has come
                    to try to engage the Soviet leadership in a serious effort to put our
                    relationship on a more stable footing, moving—if you will—from confrontation to
                    serious negotiations toward reaching solutions to the major areas of
                    disagreement between us. After two years, you have established clearly that the
                    United States has reversed course from being a nation in decline to one which
                    has both the will and capability to defend its interests and once more, play a
                    leading role in international affairs. Your defense modernization program has
                    provided the solid foundation for this broader commitment. In regional
                    issues—from Latin America to the Middle East—you have engendered the respect
                    among the local leaders essential to checking the Soviet advance. In Europe the
                    forthcoming multilateral effort to chart a new course in East-West economic
                    relations promises for the first time in a decade to turn the tide of detente
                    toward a more sober basis for limiting Soviet expansion at Allied expense.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, problems within the Soviet Union have worsened. If our economic
                    problems are bad, their’s are worse. As tenuous as our relations are with some
                    allies, their problems are even more severe as Poland makes clear. Added to
                    these are their looming problems with their ethnically diverse nationalities. To
                    relieve their domestic economic problems it would be attractive to them to find
                    a way to limit their expenditures on the military and although history gives us
                    little basis for confidence or optimism in this area, it is not out of the
                    question.</p>
                <p>From another point of view, whether or not it makes sense for us to take an
                    initiative, it is extremely likely that the Soviets will try some kind of
                    initiative—probably in arms control—to put us off guard, appeal to our allies’
                    peace movements and further drive a wedge between us. Thus, at a minimum we must
                    be ready to counter an anticipated propaganda ploy in the days or weeks
                    ahead.</p>
                <p>For my own part, I believe an initiative, conveyed through an extremely private
                    channel, would be worthwhile. The risk is, of course, <pb n="818" facs="0849" xml:id="pg_818"/>that they might perceive it as a sign of weakness
                    engendered with the increasing trouble we may have in carrying your programs
                    with the Congress and broader national uncertainty over the continued military
                    buildup. All things considered however, they have very strong incentives for
                    trying to reach agreement with us in some area—enough to make a try worthwhile
                    in my judgment.</p>
                <p>If this is true, the next question is, in what area—regional issues, arms control
                    or human rights—should we focus our attention? The attached staff paper done for
                    me goes into that question and concludes that the best opportunity is in arms
                    control and specifically the INF talks in Geneva.<note n="2" xml:id="d247fn2">Not attached.</note>
               </p>
                <p>If you were to conclude that an initiative of some kind is worth trying, an
                    important question will be whether it is feasible in terms of avoiding
                    subversion from within. This is perhaps too strong, however, it is very clear
                    that some of your appointees—well meaning and well-grounded in history—have a
                    very deep conviction that because past dialogues have been flawed and have
                    damaged US interests, that we ought not try and cannot do better. I disagree.
                    The flaws of detente in the early 70’s centered in part on the weakened ability
                    of the US (deriving from Vietnam and Watergate) to wield the sticks as well as
                    the carrots and in part from less than realistic understanding of Soviet/Marxist
                    doctrine—a tendency to impute good will and western values where they don’t
                    exist. We don’t suffer those liabilities.</p>
                <p>But the question remains—if an initiative is worthwhile, can we put it together.
                    It seems to me that that question, along with the possible agenda ought to be
                    aired by your principal advisors (The Vice President, the Secretary of State,
                    Defense, <persName corresp="#p_CWJ_1">Bill Casey</persName> and perhaps others)
                    and a recommendation given to you. If they believe that a serious effort is
                    worth a try then we can go on to think of how to put it together. If you agree,
                    I recommend that I convene a meeting in the Situation Room tomorrow to discuss
                    the matter with the principals.<note n="3" xml:id="d247fn3">An unknown hand

                <p>On December 5, 1982, President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs
                        <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">William Clark</persName> chaired an informal
                    meeting at the White House—as he had proposed to President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Ronald Reagan</persName> the previous day (see <ref target="#d247">Document 247</ref>)—to consider the prospects for improvement
                    in Soviet-American relations. No formal record of the substance of this meeting
                    was found. Deputy Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DKW_1">Kenneth
                        Dam</persName> dictated a personal note that evening in which he reported:
                    “I accompanied the Secretary to a meeting in the Situation Room chaired by
                        <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Bill Clark</persName>. This was a Cabinet-level
                    group with <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Ed Meese</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJA_1">Jim Baker</persName> included. The purpose was to discuss
                    where we go from here with the Soviet Union. The outcome of the meeting was to
                    designate me to chair a working-level group on the subject.” (Department of

                <p>On December 6, <persName corresp="#p_DKW_1">Dam</persName> dictated a personal
                    note: “At 4:30 in the afternoon I met with the working group that had been set
                    up at the meeting yesterday. This meeting in the Situation Room involved
                        <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName>, Ikle, <persName corresp="#p_MRC_1">McFarlane</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_GPF_1">Gorman</persName>, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MDJ_1">Murphy</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_CWJ_1">Casey</persName>, who
                    was there because <persName corresp="#p_MJN_1">McMahon</persName> was unable to
                    come. We discussed a series of studies to be done to help determine where we
                    should be going in our relationship with the Soviet Union over the next two
                    years, with special reference to the next six months. The midpoint in the
                        <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> first term happens to
                    coincide with the succession of <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>
                    to the leadership in the Soviet Union. Beyond that, we discussed how we could
                    get in a position to decide how to respond to any sudden Soviet initiatives,
                    either substantive or propaganda, in the near term. It was recognized that such
                    an initiative was likely in the INF area; therefore particular attention needs
                    to be paid to the substance of the issues in that area.” (Ibid.)</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_DKW_1">Dam</persName> chaired another meeting of his
                    working group on December 8. In a memorandum to the President’s Deputy Assistant
                    for National Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_MRC_1">Robert
                        McFarlane</persName> later that day, Major General <persName corresp="#p_BRT_1">Richard Boverie</persName> reported: “I attended
                    DepSecState <persName corresp="#p_DKW_1">Dam</persName>’s meeting today on arms
                    control. (This was the second such meeting.) Other attendees included <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Larry Eagleburger</persName>, Fred Ikle, <persName corresp="#p_PR_1">Richard Perle</persName>, and Lt. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_GPF_1">Paul Gorman</persName>. The bulk of the meeting was
                    devoted to a general discussion of the pros and cons of arms control. In brief,
                    the highlights were: —<persName corresp="#p_PR_1">Richard Perle</persName> noted
                    that a case could be made that the past dozen years of arms control has been
                    harmful to our national security (the military balance has shifted adversely,
                    etc.). He also said that we must engage in negotiations, but that we have to
                    determine what our objec<pb n="820" facs="0851" xml:id="pg_820"/>tives and
                    interests really are in such negotiations. —General <persName corresp="#p_GPF_1">Gorman</persName> said that in the past few years the Chiefs have turned
                    180 degrees on the issue. They now believe that arms control can be useful in
                    capping the Soviet buildup. —Fred Ikle said that we will be facing some very
                    difficult—perhaps insurmountable—verification problems in the future. Secretary
                        <persName corresp="#p_DKW_1">Dam</persName> concluded the meeting by
                    indicating that the subject for the next meeting will be cruise missiles
                    (including verification of cruise missiles) and that the subject for the meeting
                    following that will be verification control.” (Reagan Library, <persName corresp="#p_MRC_1">McFarlane</persName> Files, <persName corresp="#p_MRC_1">McFarlane</persName> Chron—December 1982)</p>

               </p>
                <p>The record of US-Soviet relations since October, 1917, has been one of tension
                    and hostility, interrupted by short-lived periods of cooperation. The Soviet
                    challenge to U.S. interests has many roots, including: (1) an imperial
                    tradition; (2) threat perceptions rooted in Russian history; and (3) the nature
                    of the Communist regime, its internal insecurity, its superpower ambitions, and
                    its ideologically-mandated animosity toward the United States as the “main
                    bastion of capitalism.”</p>
                <p>U.S. tensions with the Soviet Union have resulted in substantial measure from the
                    unrelenting growth of Soviet military power and Moscow’s readiness to use force
                    in ways which threaten U.S. Allies and pose a threat to the security of the
                    United States. The U.S. has built up its military power vis-a-vis the Soviets,
                    and has pursued a <pb n="821" facs="0852" xml:id="pg_821"/>policy of containment
                    on the periphery of the Soviet Union. Such responses are essential, and the
                    United States must sustain the resources and the will to compete effectively
                    with the Soviet Union. This will remain the primary focus of U.S. policy toward
                    the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                <p>Because Soviet aggressiveness has sources in the Soviet internal system, an
                    effective national strategy requires that U.S. policies toward that country also
                    take into account their impact on its internal development. For example, it is
                    inconsistent to raise the defense budget to meet the Soviet threat and at the
                    same time allow Western economic relations with Moscow to contribute directly to
                    the growth of Soviet military power. There is also concern among Americans about
                    the human rights situation in the Soviet Union and the lack of individual
                    freedom in Soviet society. This too requires that the U.S. take into account the
                    nature of the Soviet system in formulation of policy toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                <p>U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union proceeds on the assumption that the
                    maintenance of power by the Soviet regime rests ultimately on force and that
                    Soviet external aggressiveness stems in part from the nature of the Soviet
                    political system. Therefore, the U.S. must, within the limits of its
                    capabilities, design political, economic, and other measures which advance the
                    long-term objective of promoting: (1) the decentralization and demilitarization
                    of the Soviet economy; (2) the weakening of the power and privileged position of
                    the ruling Communist elite (<hi rend="italic">nomenklatura</hi>); (3) gradual
                    democratization of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                <p>The U.S. almost certainly lacks the capability to bring about major beneficial
                    changes in the Soviet internal order over the near to middle term. Indeed, there
                    is a real possibility that increased external pressure on the Soviet Union
                    could, at least in the short run, give the ruling Communist elite greater
                    incentive for internal repression and external aggressiveness. However, it is
                    also possible that carefully designed and implemented U.S. policies could have
                    an important, if marginal, beneficial impact on Soviet internal developments.
                    This impact could grow over time if there is a sustained effort to see that U.S.
                    policies toward the Soviet Union systematically take into account the potential
                    impact on Soviet internal developments.</p>
                <p>Thus, the first two tracks of U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union are:</p>
                <quote>
                  <p>—To compete effectively on a sustained basis with the Soviet Union in the
                        international arena, particularly in the overall military balance and in
                        geographical regions of priority concern to the United States.</p>
                    <p>—To undertake a coordinated, long-term effort to reduce the threat that the
                        Soviet system poses to our interests.</p>
               </quote>
                <p>There is an important third track. The U.S. must engage the Soviet Union in
                    dialogue and negotiations to attempt to reach agreements based on strict
                    reciprocity and mutual interest. This is particularly <pb n="822" facs="0853" xml:id="pg_822"/>important when the Soviet Union is in the midst of a
                    process of political succession.</p>
                <p>All three tracks of U.S. policy must be implemented simultaneously and sustained
                    over the long term. It will be important that the West, with firm U.S.
                    leadership, create and sustain negative and positive incentives powerful enough
                    to influence Soviet behavior. Moscow must know that irresponsible and aggressive
                    behavior will incur costs that would outweigh any gains. At the same time, the
                    U.S. must make clear to the Soviets that real restraint in their behavior would
                    pave the way for a an East-West relationship that might bring important benefits
                    for the Soviet Union. It is particularly important that this message be conveyed
                    clearly during the succession period, since this may be a particularly opportune
                    time for external forces to affect the policies of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s successors.</p>
                <p>The study which follows is not specifically an analysis of the Soviet political
                    transition, although its implications for U.S. policy are addressed. This study
                    is instead designed to outline a US-Soviet policy for the near to medium term.
                    The first part of the study examines in detail the determinants of Soviet
                    behavior, the strengths and weaknesses of the Soviet system, prospects for
                    future developments in Soviet foreign policy and within the Soviet Union itself,
                    and the degree of vulnerability of the system to external leverage. The second
                    part sets forth in detail a U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union, with emphasis
                    on the role of the military balance, U.S. relationships with Allies and
                    developing countries, interaction with Soviet allies in Eastern Europe and the
                    Third World, and bilateral relations with the Soviet Union itself. Within the
                    latter, the study places particular emphasis on how economic relations and
                    expanded political action programs can be structured and utilized to advance
                    U.S. interests.</p>

                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> on December

                </list>
                <p>On December 6, Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                    called on <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George Shultz</persName> to present a
                    Soviet demarche on the means of “improving” U.S.-Soviet relations (Tab A). The
                    demarche contained six points which can be conveniently summarized under two
                    headings:</p>
                <p>1. The Soviet Union would like to broaden the range of political relations
                    between our countries by greatly expanding diplomatic contacts and maintaining
                    continuous communications between <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>
                    and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> either directly or through
                    the respective embassies; however, they are in no hurry to arrange a summit.</p>
                <p>2. In order for such a broadening of relations to occur the United States must
                    take several concrete steps:</p>
                <quote>
                  <p>—eliminate polemical attacks on the Soviet Union such as charging it with
                        the use of chemical weapons;</p>
                    <p>—stop meddling in internal Soviet affairs; and</p>
                    <p>—adopt a different position on arms negotiations.</p>
               </quote>
                <p>What does this add up to? Moscow is willing to talk to us on a whole range of
                    topics provided we stop accusing it of violating international agreements and
                    criticizing its internal policies. We must also modify our negotiating positions
                    in Geneva to show that we really have a “desire to reach an understanding”. With
                    this demarche they are attempting to put us in a position of supplicant who must
                    pay for the right to negotiate. The question is: What are <hi rend="italic">they</hi> willing to pay for our consent?</p>

                  <p>SECTO 17002. Subject: U.S.-Soviet Dialogue: Dec 6 <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> Demarche.</p>
                  <p>Memorandum for: The President</p>
                  <p>From: <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George P. Shultz</persName>
                  </p>
                  <p>I met briefly with Soviet Amb <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName>
                    this morning at his request to hear a demarche on the state of our “dialogue”
                    and how it might be improved. Reading from a paper, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> made six points:</p>
                  <p>First, he said that as <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> had told
                    the Vice President in Moscow, the Soviets want to “rectify” the U.S.-Soviet
                    relationship through talks on concrete topics and are ready to proceed if you
                    are. But to move forward <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said we
                    needed to “eliminate artificial irritants” like our comments on Soviet chemical
                    weapons use. The Soviets, he added, do not want polemics per se, but as the
                    “Pravda” response to your Nov 22 message made clear, they will not let attacks
                    pass without answer.</p>
                  <p>Second, he said the Soviets think it is unproductive to measure the importance of
                    the issues on the U.S.-Soviet agenda by “subjective notions,” especially when
                    they pertain to internal jurisdiction. (<persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> later specified to one of my staff that this point
                    “really” referred to emigration from the Soviet Union.)</p>
                  <p>Third, the Soviets favor exchanges of views and the search for concrete
                    solutions, but he said they do not believe the results to date have been
                    satisfactory, especially in arms control. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said Moscow hoped your statement of readiness for
                    better relations will be reflected in U.S. positions on the substance of
                    negotiations, and that Moscow did not sense a desire to reach understanding in
                    the unofficial exchanges we have had in Geneva and on the eve of the Madrid
                        <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> meeting. He added that the current
                    recess in the Geneva talks offered an opportunity to think about the future of
                    the negotiations.</p>
                  <p>Fourth, he said the Soviets were prepared for broader and more active contacts
                    through the Embassies and between the Ministries of <pb n="825" facs="0856" xml:id="pg_825"/>Foreign Affairs. He added that he was always ready for
                    discussion with me, and there would be “no difficulties” for Ambassador
                        <persName corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> to see <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and First Deputy <persName corresp="#p_KG_3">Korniyenko</persName>. He also proposed mutual visits and
                    exchanges between the Ministries at other levels: Assistant Secretary, Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary, chiefs of department or desk.</p>
                  <p>Fifth, he said that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was prepared
                    to discuss any subject with me through the Ambassadors in the two capitals and
                    personally, including the Geneva negotiations. Such exchanges have proved “good
                    way to go” in the past, he observed. <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> also said that <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> was ready to take a “positive” approach to the
                    possibility of another meeting with me before the next <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> session.</p>
                  <p>Sixth, on the possibility of a summit: <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dobrynin</persName> said Soviet views are known and are similar to ours,
                    i.e., that any such meeting must be carefully prepared. I replied that I
                    regarded the message as significant; that I would bring it to your attention;
                    and that I would respond in due course. The notion of enriching our dialogue is
                    a good one, I said, and with respect to arms control, I concurred that the
                    recess in the Geneva talks is perhaps a good time to evaluate what we have
                    learned and where we should go from here. I said I was also glad to hear

               </p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Basic Situation</p>
                <p>Soviet economic growth will continue to decline in the 1980s as average annual
                    rates of increase in labor and capital decline and produc<pb n="826" facs="0857" xml:id="pg_826"/>tivity gains fall short of plans. We expect average annual
                        <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> growth to fall below 2 percent per year
                    in the 1980s.</p>
                <p>• The labor force will grow more slowly in the eighties than it did in the
                    seventies—at an average annual rate of 0.7 percent compared with 1.5
                    percent.</p>
                <p>• Growth in the productivity of Soviet plant and equipment, which has fallen
                    substantially since 1975, will continue to drop as the cost of exploiting
                    natural resources rises and Moscow is forced to spend more on
                    infrastructure.</p>
                <p>• Continued stagnation in key industrial materials—particularly metals—will
                    inhibit growth in new machinery, the key source for introducing new
                    technology.</p>
                <p>• Energy production will grow more slowly and become more expensive, whether or
                    not oil production falls.</p>
                <p>• With continued growth in domestic energy requirements, Moscow will face a
                    conflict between maintaining oil exports and meeting domestic needs.</p>
                <p>• Agriculture will remain the most unstable sector of the Soviet economy, with
                    performance in any year highly dependent on weather conditions.</p>
                <p>Slower growth of production will mean slower expansion in the availability of
                    goods and services to be divided among competing claimants—resources for future
                    growth (investment), the consumer, and defense.</p>
                <p>• Continued rapid growth in defense spending can be maintained only at the
                    expense of investment growth.</p>
                <p>• Slower expansion of investment will be compounded by the increasing demand for
                    investment goods in the energy, transportation, metallurgy, and machinery
                    sectors.</p>
                <p>• An increased share of investment in heavy industries, together with continued
                    large allocations to agriculture, will depress the expansion of housing, and
                    other consumer goods and services.</p>
                <p>Making up production shortfalls through imports will become more expensive as the
                    need for imports increases and Moscow’s ability to pay (hard currency earnings)
                    declines.</p>
                <p>• The Soviet need for imports of Western grain and other agricultural commodities
                    will remain high in the 1980s, as will requirements for Western machinery and
                    technology.</p>
                <p>• We expect real export earnings to decline between now and 1990 as sales of
                    natural gas fail to offset the drop in oil earnings, and opportunities to expand
                    exports of other commodities remain limited by their low marketability and
                    tightness in domestic supplies.</p>
                <pb n="827" facs="0858" xml:id="pg_827"/>
                <p>• The availability of Western credits will be crucial for Moscow to maintain or
                    increase its imports from the West; a tighter credit market would complicate
                    Soviet economic problems and make resource allocation decisions more
                    painful.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Options for the New Leaders</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Changes in Decision-Making Process</p>
                <p>The poor performance of the economy during the latter years of the <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> regime has driven home to the new
                    leadership the notion that there are relatively few opportunities for quick
                    fixes and that the economic problems of the current decade may spill over into
                    the 1990s. Because the new leaders can expect to reap the benefits of policies
                    with longer pay-off periods, their policy decisions may be more forward looking.
                    The new leaders will be especially sensitive to the fact that severe disruption
                    of the economic system by the implementation of hasty, ill-conceived policies
                    might be a quick route to both economic and political disaster.</p>
                <p>The new leadership probably will continue to favor bureaucratic centralism rather
                    than moving voluntarily toward fundamental systemic change. These
                    leaders—because of the stringent economic situation and their own
                    personalities—will rely more on tightened discipline and control to effect
                    economic policies of long standing than on coaxing desired behavior through
                    increased incentives. <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s long
                    tenure in the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> has given him experience in
                    using administrative measures to modify behavior. Moreover, the Soviet people,
                    faced with unsettling economic and social problems, seem ready to accept a
                    leader who would demand greater discipline.</p>
                <p>This trend, however, would not rule out a mix of liberal and authoritarian
                    measures. Greater dependence on the private sector, for example, is a distinct
                    possibility that could be classified as liberal, while harsher penalties for
                    labor absenteeism and mismanagement, though authoritarian in nature, need not
                    mark a return to neo-Stalinism.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Changes in Policy</p>
                <p>The new leaders will surely bring changes in economic policy. Because they have
                    laid particular stress on continuity, and because it may take some time to
                    develop a strong consensus, new policy lines may not appear until the 1986–90
                    five year plan has been drafted—i.e., 1984/85. Some indications of change are
                    likely to be discernable next year, however, as discussion and debate about
                    policies for the late eighties ensues and annual plans for 1984 and 1985 are
                    formulated.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Major Claimants</hi>. The hardest policy decision for the
                        <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> leadership will be resource
                    allocation among the major claimants. Maintaining historical growth in defense
                    spending would squeeze invest<pb n="828" facs="0859" xml:id="pg_828"/>ment and
                    consumption further. Keeping investment growth at current rates as well, might
                    result in an absolute decline in consumption.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Military</hi>. Strong incentives exist for at least some
                    slowdown in military hardware procurement. In addition to needing more resources
                    to break economic bottlenecks, a slowdown (or even zero growth) in military
                    procurement for a few years would have no appreciable negative impact on forces
                    already in the field, and modernization of these forces could still proceed. We
                    believe the groundwork for such a course may have already been laid in <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s speech to top military officers on
                    27 October 1982. In any event, this course will be required if the <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> Politburo wants to improve economic
                    performance substantially.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Investment</hi>. A strong candidate to receive more investment
                    funds is the machine-building sector—because of the need to modernize Soviet
                    industry and because of constraints on importing foreign machinery and
                    technology. Modernizing machine-building would also help justify a temporary
                    slowdown in defense hardware as such action could ultimately enhance military
                    hardware production. The new leadership, with its longer time horizon, might
                    launch such an effort.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Consumption</hi>. A new leadership prone to authoritarian
                    solutions is likely to be more pragmatic in its consumer policy, and may place
                    more stress on tying wages and “perks” more closely to production results.
                    Retail prices may also be raised on all but essential goods and services, and an
                    expansion of the private sector in consumer services may be in the offing.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Reform</hi>. The new leadership’s predilection for
                    administrative measures and bureaucratic centralism would severely limit the
                    extent of future economic reform. The difficult economic situation argues
                    against reform measures—like those launched in Eastern Europe—that had never
                    been tested in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Some movement toward
                    a regionally organized economy might be thought more suitable to today’s
                    problems—for example, exploitation of energy and raw materials in Siberia.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Agriculture</hi>. The new leaders will continue to support the
                    farm sector, but might decide to favor the industries that support agriculture
                    and those that process its output. The Food Program already does this to some
                    extent, but an actual cut of investment inside the farm gate would be a stronger
                    signal of the new leaders’ dissatisfaction with the returns from agricultural
                    investment.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Labor</hi>. In addition to instilling tighter discipline, the
                    new leaders are apt to focus on automating manual labor (consistent with more
                    investment in machinery), and developing social and cultural infrastructure in
                    labor-deficit regions. The latter would provide some inducment for emigrants
                    from labor surplus areas and reinforce a regionally differentiated pro-natal
                    policy favoring the labor deficit areas.</p>
                <pb n="829" facs="0860" xml:id="pg_829"/>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">East-West Trade</hi>. With economic problems pressing from
                    every quarter, the new leadership might welcome—though perhaps not publicly—the
                    opportunity to expand economic ties with the West in general and with the US in
                    particular; the more so if decisions are taken to slow growth in military
                    hardware, step-up investment in machinery, and reduce investment on the farms.
                    Under these circumstances, Moscow might find it advantageous to press for (1)
                    economic ties that provide them with technology and goods for both civilian and
                    military purposes and (2) arms control arrangements that limit Western advances
                    in military technology which they would find difficult and costly to
                    counter.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Impact of Changes</hi>. These changes in approach and policies
                    will not be a panacea for the Soviet economy’s ills. Nevertheless, the changed
                    policies could bring marginal improvements in key areas and allow the new
                    leadership to continue to muddle through even in the face of economic conditions
                    probably worse than they had expected. Of primary importance to the new leaders,
                    these policies would not require the surrender of power and would continue to
                    allow them the freedom to impose their will on the smallest economic or
                    administrative unit. In this way, they could feel assured of their ability to
                    handle such problems as public unrest, external economic or military threats, or
                    internal disasters that would require an emergency redistribution of
                    resources.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Opportunities for the US</p>
                <p>Opportunities for the US to influence the policy changes discussed above lie
                    mainly in whether and to what extent we are willing to expand commercial ties
                    with Moscow and in the signals we send the new Soviet leaders with respect to
                    arms control negotiations. Of most immediate use to Moscow would be an arms
                    control agreement that would provide a more predictable future strategic
                    environment and thereby permit the Soviets to avoid certain costly new
                    systems—and perhaps thereby enable them to increase somewhat future investment
                    for bottleneck sectors of the economy—particularly transportation, ferrous
                    metals, and machine building. Soviet officials have clearly indicated that
                    staying with the United States in an arms race would have dire consequences for
                    their economy. They probably are also uncertain of their ability to keep up
                    technologically.</p>
                <p>Moscow’s recent attitude toward purchases of US grain notwithstanding, the United
                    States could again become an important source of Soviet purchases of
                    agricultural products and machinery and equipment for both agriculture and
                    industry. The need is there, if the “price” (including sanctity of contract) is
                    right. Soviet agriculture could benefit substantially from US technology in
                    livestock feed production, fertilizer <pb n="830" facs="0861" xml:id="pg_830"/>application, and animal breeding, and the US is still Moscow’s best long-term
                    bet for grain imports on a large scale.</p>
                <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> faces increasing dependence on the
                    West in developing and processing its oil and gas resources in the 1980s. From a
                    technical viewpoint, the US is the preferred supplier of most types of oil and
                    gas equipment because it is by far the largest producer, with the most
                    experience, the best support network, and often the best technology. In some
                    products—for example, large capacity down-hole pumps—the US has a world monopoly
                    (albeit one that could be broken in a few years by entry of other Western
                    producers), and the most critical needs of Soviet oil industry are for just such
                    equipment.</p>
                <p>Because the prospects for Soviet hard currency earnings in the 1980s are far from
                    bright, Western credits will have to cover an increasing proportion of Soviet
                    imports from the West. An increase in the availability of US government backed
                    credit could look very attractive to the new leaders in Moscow.</p>
                <p>However, since the mid-1970s, the Soviet experience in commercial relations with
                    the US has been disappointing to Moscow, and it would probably take a strong
                    initiative on our part just to get their attention. Although a US offer to renew
                    close economic ties with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> might be
                    welcome, it would probably be greeted skeptically by the Soviet leadership as
                    primarily a tactical maneuver—a further retreat by Washington (following the
                    grain and pipeline decisions) brought about by US-West European economic
                    competition and pressures from US business circles. Needing to consolidate his
                    power, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> could not—even if he
                    wished—respond unilaterally to such an initiative, but would have to move within
                    a leadership consensus strongly influenced by the views of <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName>, who would urge caution. Thus the Soviets might:</p>
                <p>• Accept part of the offer as a means of coping with particularly acute
                    bottlenecks, especially in technology and food supplies.</p>
                <p>• Seek to avoid the establishment of long-term economic dependencies on the
                    US.</p>
                <p>• Exploit any new atmosphere of mutual accommodation as a means of reinforcing
                    support in the United States and Western Europe for cutbacks in defense spending
                    and arms control measures favorable to Soviet interests.</p>
                <p>We would expect the Soviets to give any US initiative low-key treatment, publicly
                    casting doubt on US motives, but at the same time seeking to engage the
                    Administration in a dialogue about it. A US offer to return to a
                    “business-as-usual” basis would probably not result in any surge in orders for
                    US companies beyond the sectors in which the US is already an important
                    supplier. Moscow is at least as likely to <pb n="831" facs="0862" xml:id="pg_831"/>use the opportunity created by a US offer to put commercial
                    pressure on the West Europeans and Japanese, and exacerbate existing tensions in
                    the Alliance. At a minimum, Moscow would press for US government guarantees
                    regarding fulfillment of contracts while at a maximum it might seek repeal of
                    the <persName corresp="#p_JH_1">Jackson</persName>-Vanik and Stevenson
                    amendments. In either case, it would refuse to make any significant political
                    concessions in return—which <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>
                    probably could not deliver even if he desired. If this process permitted the
                    Soviets to acquire more technology on acceptable terms from the United States,
                    they would do so—but not at the expense of established ties with Western Europe
                    and Japan, or of their own long-term economic independence. The Soviets have
                    traditionally taken advantage of opportunities to exploit relations with the
                    West to acquire technology and goods for both military and civilian purposes and
                    we expect they will continue to do so.</p>

                </list>
                <p>At your request, State has prepared a study on likely Soviet policies in the next
                    6–24 months and our possible responses (Tab I).<note n="2" xml:id="d252fn2">See
                            <ref target="#d249">Document 249</ref>.</note> I find the paper utterly
                    disappointing in almost every respect and quite useless for purposes of policy
                    guidance.</p>
                <p>The State Department assumes—contrary to all evidence—that the primary concern of
                    the current Soviet administration lies in the area of foreign policy whereas all
                    the evidence indicates that its uppermost concerns are internal. The <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> regime must first of all solidify its
                    power by placing its own people in positions of authority and removing rivals.
                    Next it must reinvigorate the flagging economy by raising productivity, reducing
                    thefts of state property, and meeting mounting consumer demands. Then it has to
                    deal with pressures within <pb n="832" facs="0863" xml:id="pg_832"/>the
                    Communist Empire. These are <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s
                    prime concerns and to acknowledge them means painting a very different picture
                    of the “View from Moscow” from that presented in State’s study. The latter
                    document is wildly optimistic about the ability of the present regime to handle
                    internal difficulties and concentrate on foreign policies.</p>
                <p>In dealing with U.S. responses, State’s study repeats tired old arguments about a
                    combination of containment and cooperation with the Soviet Union. That whole
                    part of the study (pages 4–10) could easily have been produced under President
                        <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>. The underlying premise is
                    that we are dealing with an ordinary pragmatic regime that will respond to a
                    combination of carrots and sticks. The fact that the leadership of the Soviet
                    government is now in the hands of a one-time head of the Security Police and
                    that this presents us with a very special kind of threat is not even considered.
                    There is no sense here of a Soviet global strategy and therefore no
                    recommendation of a global U.S. response. While it is true that the study was to
                    deal only with the next two years, surely its analyses and prescription must
                    harmonize with the long-term views taken by the Soviet <gloss target="#t_NSDD_1">NSDD</gloss>: they do not do that at all. In particular, there is no
                    mention here of the need to apply internal pressure on the Soviet Union and its
                    Empire through economic, political, and ideological instrumentalities which
                    constitutes one of the three principal U.S. policy objectives of the Soviet

                  </hi> was asked to discuss the study in detail. He pointed
                    out that the differences could be viewed as relatively minor, given the scope of
                    the study and the importance of the subject. All agree, he said, that U.S.
                    policy should contribute to containing (and over time reversing) Soviet
                    expansionism, should promote internal <pb n="834" facs="0865" xml:id="pg_834"/>change in the Soviet system, and should involve negotiation where U.S.
                    interest would be served by such an approach. He reviewed the major elements of
                    the study, and then described the general areas of difference: (1) whether U.S.
                    policy should have as a goal inducing the Soviets to shift resources from
                    capital investment in heavy industry and related activities toward the consumer
                    sector; (2) whether we should adopt as a goal refraining from assisting the
                    Soviet in developing their natural resources; (3) and whether there should be
                    boycotts on agriculture as part of total trade.</p>

                    refraining from assisting the Soviets with development of their natural

                    thought interagency agreement had been reached to take this out of the drafts,
                    and did not understand why it was in the paper.</p>

                  </hi> said she too was bothered by the ambiguous way
                    in which technology was discussed in the paper. What, for instance, was meant by
                    “critical” technology? She presumed that the central goal was to avoid helping
                    the Soviets develop their military establishment.</p>

                  </hi>
                    suggested that perhaps what was intended was “unique” technology, i.e.,
                    technology that the U.S. has but not its allies.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Secretary Baldridge</hi> interjected that the discussion showed
                    how complicated the subject was, and that it needed clarification at the <gloss target="#t_SIG_1">SIG</gloss>. We cannot give business such ambiguous
                    guidance.</p>
                <p>At Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName>’s request, <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PR_2">Pipes</persName>
                  </hi> pointed
                    out that the word “critical” was not in the draft initially, but was added at
                    State’s insistence.</p>

                    transfer of technology, suggested that we should be examing all technology, and
                    if that means that business goes abroad, so be it.</p>

                    the technology elsewhere. This discussion was continued, with Secretaries
                        <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> and Baldridge
                    participating, and with comments from Judge <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clark</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KJJ_1">Kirkpatrick</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d253fn4">In a December 17

                    <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> made public Moscow’s offer in
                    the INF talks to reduce Soviet “medium range” missiles in Europe to a number
                    equivalent to the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and French missile forces.
                    He appeared to tie this offer, however, to an additional agreement on INF
                    aircraft. He reiterated Moscow’s threat to deploy an <gloss target="#t_ICBM_1">ICBM</gloss> analogous to the MX and stated that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was already testing a long-range cruise
                    missile which would be deployed if the US proceeded to deploy long-range cruise
                    missiles of its own.</p>
                <pb n="838" facs="0869" xml:id="pg_838"/>
                <p>At the same time, he reaffirmed Moscow’s commitment to strategic arms limitations
                    and reiterated the Soviet Union’s willingness to reduce the level of strategic
                    nuclear delivery vehicles by 25 percent below the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II aggregates.</p>
                <p>—<persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s INF missile proposal has
                    previously been made by Soviet negotiators in Geneva. It implies a Soviet
                    willingness to reduce approximately one-third of its SS–20 force opposite Europe
                    in addition to the dismantlement of approximately 250 older SS–4 and SS–5
                    missiles. The Soviet offer remains contingent, however, on nondeployment of new
                        <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> missiles.</p>
                <p>—His announcement of the Soviet cruise missile program is new. It is intended to
                    heighten pressure on West Europeans to break with <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s INF plans and may be related to previous Soviet threats to
                    place the US in an analogous strategic position if <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> proceeds with INF modernization.</p>
                <p>—<persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s claim that Moscow is willing
                    to reduce strategic delivery vehicles by 25 percent is consistent with Moscow’s
                        <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> offer to reduce 1,800 <gloss target="#t_ICBM_1">ICBMs</gloss>, SLBMs, and heavy bombers from the agreed
                        <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II level of 2,400.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Domestic Aspects</p>
                <p>The domestic portion of <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s speech
                    provided few clues about the direction of policy in coming months, and suggested
                    he has yet to formulate a comprehensive plan for attacking economic problems. He
                    refrained from praising <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>,
                    however, perhaps out of a desire to dissociate himself from the policy failures
                    of recent years.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s remarks on domestic policy
                    focused on the nationality question, as had <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s speech 10 years ago and as was appropriate for the
                    anniversary of the Soviet Union’s formation. Overall, his remarks emphasized the
                    themes of Russian nationalism and political and economic centralization. He
                    emphasized, for example, the need for greater regional specialization. And his
                    statement that the final aim of nationality policy was the “merger” of national
                    cultures and peoples, for example, was a centralizing formulation that has not
                    been used in recent years. However, he seemed to call for increased
                    representation of indigenous nationalities in the party and state institutions
                    of non-Russian republics. He attributed the persistence of parochial tendencies
                    among Soviet nationalities partly to “mistakes we make in our work.”</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> also made a brief reference to
                    the food program, suggesting that this part of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s domestic policy will continue. He stressed the need
                    to improve transportation, reinforcing other indications that improving the
                    performance of this distressed sector will be a top priority.</p>
                <p>
                  <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName> made a brief introductory
                    speech. The prominent role accorded him indicates that he remains a key figure
                    in the leadership, <pb n="839" facs="0870" xml:id="pg_839"/>and further
                    indicates that he is exercising responsibility within the Secretariat for

                <p>At Tab I is the text of an intemperately-worded “unofficial” paper delivered by

                    Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName>.
                    The demarche disclaims any Soviet or Bulgarian responsibility in the attempted
                    assassination of the Pope, alleges that the U.S. is waging a “slanderous
                    campaign” against the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, and further accuses the U.S. of
                    libeling Soviet leaders.<note n="2" xml:id="d255fn2">Reports about potential

                        Paul II arose following a question <persName corresp="#p_PR_2">Pipes</persName> received in a December 17 interview recorded for CNN,
                        the substance of which leaked that day. “I responded that given the
                        virtually certain participation of the Bulgarian secret services, which the
                            <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> controlled, it was not implausible
                        to assume that the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> had had a hand in
                        it, although there was no hard evidence to this effect,” recalled <persName corresp="#p_PR_2">Pipes</persName>, who had given the interview with the
                        understanding that it would be aired after his departure from the
                        administration at the end of that week, upon the conclusion of his 2-year
                        sabbatical from Harvard. (<persName corresp="#p_PR_2">Pipes</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Vixi,</hi> p. 205)</note> The paper reflects a strong
                    reaction to Western speculations that <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>, as former head of the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>, must have been intimately involved in the attempted
                    assassination. It concludes with usual Soviet rhetoric by saying that unless
                    this campaign of vilification against Soviet and Bulgarian leadership ceases,
                    the Soviets will feel “free to act accordingly”—whatever this means.</p>

                <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName> has already
                    rejected the protest and its allegations as entirely false. In fact, he noted
                    that U.S. official comment on this issue has been restrained. Lastly, the Under
                    Secretary mentioned that the offensive tone and content of the paper could
                    affect U.S. views of the new Soviet leadership’s attitudes on our bilateral

                  <p>An unbridled slanderous campaign is being conducted in the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> against Bulgaria and the Soviet Union alleging
                    their involvement in the assassination attempt on Pope John-Paul II in May
                    1981.</p>
                  <p>All this malicious campaign, as is also openly admitted in the American press, is
                    being carried out with the knowledge and encouragement of the US official
                    bodies. It is being directed and coordinated by the American special
                    services.</p>
                  <p>We reject in a most categorical way this provocative ploy and the attempts to use
                    a blatant lie in order to cast aspersion on the Soviet Union and other socialist
                    countries.</p>
                  <p>The very suggestion alleging a possible existence in the socialist countries of
                    certain quarters which can have anything to do with terrorist acts, is
                    fundamentally absurd. It runs counter to the policy and ideology of our
                    society.</p>
                  <p>The government of the United States of America, undoubtedly, knows that neither
                    Bulgaria, nor the Soviet Union are involved in the actions which some people
                    seek to ascribe to them. No one is in possession of any facts at all with regard
                    to this matter, if one is to speak of nothing but facts and not of the
                    concoctions being fabricated. As to facts, they are simply not in existence. And
                    if, nevertheless, heinous allegations regarding the Soviet Union are continuing,
                    it can be viewed in no other way, but as a deliberate line aimed at exacerbating
                    an atmosphere of animosity in the relationship between our countries. The Soviet
                    side, of course, will draw appropriate conclusions therefrom.</p>
                  <pb n="841" facs="0872" xml:id="pg_841"/>
                  <p>Absolutely inadmissable are offensive personal invectives allowed in the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> lately regarding the Soviet leadership. It is
                    perfectly clear that this constitutes a gross contradiction of both the
                    requirements of elementary ethics and the commonly accepted norms of intercourse
                    among states maintaining diplomatic relations with one another.</p>
                  <p>The Soviet side lodges a resolute protest with the US government in this regard
                    and indignantly declines the insinuations of that sort.</p>
                  <p>It is well known that, on our part, we, so far, have been exercising restraint in
                    this respect. However, it should be clear that there must be a limit to
                    everything. If, on the US part, no effective measures are taken to cease
                    invectives regarding the Soviet leadership, we will consider ourselves free to
                    act accordingly.</p>

                  <persName corresp="#p_CWJ_1">Bill Casey</persName> forwarded you an insightful
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> report (Tab A) entitled, “<persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>: His Power and Program.” The primary
                    findings include:</p>
                <p>1. The precedent of an extended period for a new Soviet leader to consolidate
                    power does not apply. <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> is a
                    “leader who has come to power with firm support in the Politburo at the outset,
                    and who has a mandate to act in <hi rend="italic">both</hi> domestic and foreign
                    affairs.” He is supported by the military, the security apparatus and powerful
                    conservative elements of the Party.</p>
                <p>2. Given <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s promotion and
                    apparently unchallenged accession to power, he will move promptly to address and
                    tackle domestic and foreign issues/problems, displaying initiative and resolve
                    where necessary. His domestic agenda might include: continuing a “vigilence”
                    campaign to restore discipline, waging a major anti-corruption campaign, seeking
                    additional resources for both the military and the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>, generating limited experimentation and economic reform, <pb n="842" facs="0873" xml:id="pg_842"/>and promoting greater realism in
                    planning and recognition of problems. <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s foreign policy agenda might entail:</p>
                <quote>
                  <p>—Curbing U.S. strategic modernization, preventing the INF deployment and
                        deepening the rift between the U.S. and Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>—Permitting some flexibility toward East European efforts to cope with
                        economic problems, but only within the context of close ties to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and firm party control.</p>
                    <p>—Securing a pseudo-neutral government in Kabul which would allow Moscow to
                        achieve some sort of regional settlement and withdraw some forces.</p>
                    <p>—Vigorously pursuing policies intended to improve Sino-Soviet
                    relations.</p>
               </quote>
                <p>The report concludes that the Soviet Union is likely to pose an even greater
                    threat to U.S. security as we are faced with a more active, intelligent, adroit
                        adversary—<persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>.</p>

                <p>1. Here is a memorandum on how we now see the thrust and scope of <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s program. It was prepared by
                        <persName corresp="#p_GR_1">Bob Gates</persName>, our Deputy Director for
                    Intelligence, who has maintained a realistic view of Soviet purposes. He did two
                    stints at the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>, one with <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and one with Brzezinski, and two
                    stints at <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> as National Intelligence Officer
                    for Soviet Affairs. You may recall that this experience was put to good use last
                    year in analyzing <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                    correspondence with you and recommending responses.</p>
                <p>2. One added feature which has struck me is the emerging picture of <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName> as giving <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> crucial support. When you put together <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName>’s 30-odd years in command of defense
                    industries and then defense and <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s 15 years at the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>, you
                    get an awesome <pb n="843" facs="0874" xml:id="pg_843"/>concentration of
                    institutional power. To brag a little, I attach a note in which we called this

                        <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>: His Power and

                  </list>
                  <p>1. The emerging conventional wisdom seems to be that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will now enter a period of collegial rule in
                    which continuity will be stressed and the new leaders will hold back from
                    significant policy changes for the near to medium term. In this view, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> will be preoccupied with internal
                    matters such as improving the economy and any new initiatives that do appear
                    will likely focus on domestic affairs rather than foreign policy. The immediate
                    post-Khrushchev period is cited as precedent for what will happen.</p>
                  <p>2. I believe that analysis is based on a misreading of the events of recent days,
                        <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s character, and history. In
                    1953, a number of new initiatives followed the death of Stalin (and preceded
                    Khrushchev’s consolidation of power)—a purge of the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>, an end to the intra-party terror, the Virgin Lands program, a
                    decision to end the Korean War, and a mending of relations with the Yugoslavs.
                    In 1964, the new leaders swept aside a number of major changes Khrushchev had
                    made in the party organization, sharply raised investment in agriculture, began
                    the heavy military buildup on the Sino-Soviet border, and actively began to
                    support North Vietnam’s effort to take over the South.</p>
                  <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> comes to power at a time when
                    there is a widely perceived need for renewal in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>—to get the economy moving again, to get rid of corruption, to
                    restore discipline, to reassert the idealism of the Revolution and relatedly to
                    reaffirm Russia’s mission<pb n="844" facs="0875" xml:id="pg_844"/>ary/evangelical role at home and abroad. Perversely, this often takes the
                    shape of nostalgia for Stalin. It is his forcefulness, toughness, decisiveness
                    and ability to move the country that the Party seeks in <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>—believing they can have all that
                    without the old dictator’s less welcome attributes (such as a tendency to shoot
                    his colleagues).</p>
                  <p>4. The Soviet leadership appears to have decided last spring that <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> was the man to lead the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> out of its political and economic doldrums
                    after <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s death. He was moved from
                    the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> back to the Central Committee
                    Secretariat, a more appropriate and acceptable launching point. I believe that
                    since then he has steadily consolidated his power and begun, with his
                    colleagues, to develop new initiatives and implement certain of them—even before
                    assuming power. As the Soviets say, “it is not by accident” that in the last
                    several months we have seen both a new internal crackdown in the Soviet Union
                    and also a major new initiative in foreign policy—the effort to improve
                    relations between the Soviet Union and China. There also are indications that
                    the military has been asking for additional resources. In my judgment, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> has been behind the first two of these
                    initiatives and supported the third.</p>
                  <p>5. In brief, I believe the precedent of an extended period for the new leader to
                    consolidate power—as with <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> after
                    the overthrow of Khrushchev—does not apply this time around. This view is
                    supported by <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s prompt
                    appointment; his clear authoritativeness during events surrounding <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s funeral; his role and “presence” in
                    meetings with the principal foreign visitors; the quick promotion of an old
                        <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> colleague to the Politburo; and his
                    speeches at the Central Committee Plenum and Supreme Soviet. This time we have a
                    leader who has come to power with firm support in the Politburo at the outset,
                    has a mandate to act in <hi rend="italic">both</hi> domestic and foreign
                    affairs, and will do so.</p>
                  <p>6. The nature of this succession and the character of <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> himself argue strongly that he will move promptly and
                    broadly to tackle many of Russia’s problems. For the first time in Soviet
                    history, there has been a smooth succession where the new leader has assumed
                    power in an orderly way and probably with greater leeway to make decisions than
                    enjoyed by his predecessor. Indeed, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> has been chosen because he is a man who can make
                    decisions and hopefully can end the long period of drift, especially in internal
                    affairs. He is on close terms with the powerful conservative elements in the
                    Soviet hierarchy and is a man who can act with both intelligence and imagination
                    on a long list of pressing foreign and domestic issues. What we are likely to
                    see with <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> is preservation of the
                    forms of “collegiality” but the absence of its paralyzing effect on
                    decisionmaking. All of the senior policymakers who might block <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> are dead or out of power; those who
                    remain, such as <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>, are <pb n="845" facs="0876" xml:id="pg_845"/>closely allied with him; his presumed rival, <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName>, appears (for now, at least) to have
                    been co-opted.</p>
                  <p>7. Given <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s prompt and apparently
                    unchallenged accession to power, his personality and past history, and the
                    problems that face him, what might <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s agenda resemble for the coming period? On the basis
                    of both 1953 and 1964, historical experience would suggest that a number of
                    changes or initiatives can be expected:</p>
                  <p rend="sectiontitleital">Internal Affairs</p>
                  <p>—A continuation of the “vigilance” campaign and internal crackdown to restore
                    discipline, to give the impression of a strong hand at the top again, to
                    forestall any impression of internal relaxation as a result of the succession,
                    to keep the country well under control so that other initiatives or reforms do
                    not lead to unrealistic expectations or spontaneous popular action, and to
                    secure the home front for perhaps severe measures to revive the economy.</p>
                  <p>—A major anti-corruption campaign by a man who is said to have a reputation for
                    being relatively “clean” among Soviet leaders. The promotion of Aliyev to the
                    Politburo further suggests action in this area. It is plain that many of the
                    present political problems in Poland and Romania grow out of popular awareness
                    and resentment of the corruption of senior party officials. While <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> would have to proceed carefully with
                    this, the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>’s role in exposing the corruption
                    of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s family early in the year is
                    indicative of his willingness to use this issue both politically and for larger
                    ends. With his <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> background, he would know
                    against whom to strike. There might even be a return of an occasional show trial
                    specifically for corruption, although <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> would choose the targets with care to insulate his
                    strongest supporters.</p>
                  <p>—It seems logical and likely that <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>
                    would press for additional resources for both the military and the <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>. These are important constituencies for him
                    and for his principal supporters in the leadership. While there might be some
                    reallocation of priorities within the military, overall greater resources to
                    respond to the perceived increased threat from the US are in the cards, in my
                    view.</p>
                  <p>—On the economy, while specific policies are difficult to forecast at this point,
                    we should expect “reform” and perhaps some limited experimentation. The focus on
                    internal discipline, anti-corruption and vigilance—in essence, the maintenance
                    of strict internal controls—must go hand in hand with any effort to undertake
                    economic reform or experiments, witness the Polish experience. While a more
                    detailed analysis of economic options available to the new leadership will take
                    more time, the essential message is that we should anticipate change in this
                    area and it seems likely to involve (1) greater trade with the <pb n="846" facs="0877" xml:id="pg_846"/>West, (2) more problems for us in the area of
                    technology transfer, and (3) more difficulty with our Western and Japanese
                    allies over the issue of trade with the East. The idea of <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s willingness to consider reform in
                    the Soviet economy is suggested by stories that he has been the protector of
                    Hungarian economic reform and is willing to consider such new
                    approaches—although Hungary is obviously a much smaller country and the costs of
                    failure are not as high (always a disincentive to agricultural reform in
                    Russia).</p>
                  <p>—In the Party itself, I expect to see <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> move to improve the competence of senior officials
                    generally while ensuring that the new men are sympathetic to his objectives and
                    politically supportive. He already is placing his own people in openings on the
                    Politburo, Secretariat, and elsewhere in the hierarchy.</p>
                  <p>—More generally, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s advocacy at
                    the Supreme Soviet of greater realism in planning and recognition of problems,
                    and the call of an important Soviet newspaper editorial last week for a major
                    revamping of the Soviet bureaucracy, both suggest that significant changes are
                    in store internally.</p>
                  <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign Policy</p>
                  <p>—<hi rend="italic">US:</hi>
                    <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> seems likely to pursue a policy
                    directed at achieving simultaneously some visible reduction in tensions with the
                    United States, curbing new US arms programs, preventing the deployment of INF,
                    and dividing the US from its European allies. A conciliatory approach to the
                    United States and effective use of peace-oriented propaganda and “active
                    measures” are to be expected. The Soviets will try to reinforce notions already
                    current in the West of the need for forthcoming gestures to the new Soviet
                    leader and the need to take advantage of this “new beginning.” While the
                    European decision on INF remains uncertain it would seem most unlikely for the
                    Soviets to abandon the Geneva talks. Rather, we should be prepared for
                    imaginative Soviet initiatives both in negotiations and in public in the next
                    few months to throw the US on the defensive and increase divisions between the
                    Europeans and ourselves. Should INF deployment actually begin, the Soviets could
                    then walk out in Geneva and blame failure on the US. They would subsequently
                    strive to prevent full deployment by playing on European fears and purported US
                    intransigence.</p>
                  <p>The Soviets have seen a steady deterioration in US-Soviet relations for seven
                    years under three US administrations. I believe they have concluded that the
                    moment for establishing a more benign relationship on their terms has passed.
                    Arms control negotiations and other forms of cooperation with the US government
                    are likely considered to hold out little prospect of success for years to come.
                    Thus, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> probably will focus Soviet
                    policy on isolating the US and trying, through <pb n="847" facs="0878" xml:id="pg_847"/>all instruments available to him, to build opposition to US
                    military modernization and to US policies toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> generally, both in the US and abroad.</p>
                  <p>—<hi rend="italic">East-West Trade:</hi>
                    <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> likely will continue efforts to
                    tie East and West Europe to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> through
                    economic “cooperation” and trade. The Soviets already are aware of the leverage
                    they hold because of the value of East-West trade to the West and the jobs said
                    to depend upon it. Trade thus has <hi rend="italic">both</hi> economic and
                    political benefits for them. <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>
                    presumably will strive to maximize these benefits and seek a corollary benefit
                    in the strains such increased dealings will bring between the US and its allies.
                    After removal by the US of sanctions imposed after Afghanistan and after Poland,
                    this instrument of US policy will have little credibility in the future in
                    Soviet eyes. Indeed, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> will see
                    the US as little more than an annoyance in the area of trade and technology
                    transfer, unable to impose discipline inside the US, much less in Europe and
                    Japan.</p>
                  <p>—<hi rend="italic">Eastern Europe:</hi>
                    <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> reportedly has evinced
                    considerable hostility to the Yugoslavs, Romanians and Czechs in the
                    past—implying little tolerance for deviation from loyalty to Moscow and
                    political orthodoxy. Almost as proof, his meeting with the Yugoslavs after the
                        <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> funeral was “harsh” and he
                    pointedly snubbed Ceausescu. On the other hand, he is said to be close to Kadar
                    of Hungary and a protector of Hungarian economic reforms. This and other
                    information suggests some flexibility toward East European efforts to cope with
                    economic problems but only within the context of close ties to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and firm party control. As in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> could well urge his East European colleagues to impose
                    stricter discipline at home—accompanied by a campaign to root out obvious and
                    damaging corruption in high places, perhaps by making examples of some
                    officials.</p>
                  <p>—<hi rend="italic">Afghanistan:</hi> Afghanistan seems to be a candidate for a
                    new Soviet initiative to try to diminish in some measure both the insurgency
                    there and their military role. It continues to be an embarrassment for them in
                    Islamic countries as well as in the West, it does impose a certain military cost
                    in both materiel and casualties, and it is an obstacle to any significant
                    reconciliation with the Chinese. Some new initiative combining a new government
                    with some greater legitimacy in Afghanistan (although still under Soviet
                    control) coupled with strong pressure on Pakistan to abandon its supporting role
                    for the insurgents could conceivably meet with some success if orchestrated well
                    by the Soviets. It could involve a government in Kabul with a figleaf image of
                    neutrality and a diminution of support for the insurgents that would allow the
                    Soviets to withdraw at least some of their forces.</p>
                  <p>—<hi rend="italic">Middle East:</hi> The short term options are not bright, but
                    the Soviets are prepared to be patient. Egypt and Iran are the big prizes and
                        <pb n="848" facs="0879" xml:id="pg_848"/>
                     <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> will pursue overt and covert policies designed to take
                    advantage of any instability in either country.</p>
                  <p>—<hi rend="italic">Kampuchea:</hi> Kampuchea is another area where the Soviets
                    could make some concessions to the Chinese for larger ends. Never before have
                    the Soviets shown any particular sensitivity to Hanoi’s concerns. While Vietnam
                    might not abandon its campaign in Kampuchea under Soviet pressure, the Soviets
                    still could claim to the Chinese that they were no longer supporting Vietnam’s
                    effort and were amenable to new political arrangements that could be worked out.
                    This might involve some sort of face saving settlements that would not represent
                    a defeat for Vietnam but would get most of their troops out of the country.</p>
                  <p>—<hi rend="italic">Third World:</hi> In the Third World, I believe we can expect
                    not only a continuation of the direct and indirect destabilization activities
                    the Soviets have had underway in recent years but perhaps an increase in that
                    activity. In many ways Soviet policy in the Third World is likely to be
                    indicative of a more assertive Soviet role abroad generally, although as our
                    papers on <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> have made clear, he
                    prefers to win by strategem and maneuver rather than resort to force—although he
                    will use force if maneuvering fails and the risks are deemed acceptable.</p>
                  <p>—<hi rend="italic">China:</hi> As I have suggested in several places above, I
                    believe <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> is playing a key role in
                    the new initiative to try and patch things up with China. At some point, this
                    will involve tough decisions for the Soviets because any real reconciliation
                    with China will require acceding to Chinese preconditions relating to
                    Afghanistan, Kampuchea or Soviet deployments along the Chinese border. The
                    latter is probably the easiest area for the Soviets to be responsive. <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s pointed conversation with Foreign
                    Minister Huang Hua after <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                    funeral, the meeting between Huang Hua and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName> the next day and Chinese willingness to send Huang Hua
                    is indicative of both powers intent to pursue an improved relationship at
                    minimum and to improve their mutual positions with respect to the US.</p>
                  <p>8. In sum, the US faces a new and, in many ways, far more intelligent and
                    skillful adversary than we confronted in Khrushchev or <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>—and a man who is a “doer”. He is
                    familiar with the world and a realist. My money says we will face a much greater
                    challenge from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> under his leadership.
                    While the specifics of his program are difficult to construct, we should be
                    prepared for significant new Soviet initiatives in both internal and foreign
                    policy. A leadership has come to power during the last two weeks in the Soviet
                    Union with greater power and more unity at the highest level than after either
                    the succession in 1953 or 1964. It has come to power with considerable work to
                    do and <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> is not a man who will
                    delay in setting in motion initiatives to address a number of issues and
                    problems. The effort to <pb n="849" facs="0880" xml:id="pg_849"/>repair
                    relations with China—long thought out of the question by most analysts in the
                    West—is indicative of the kind of flexibility, pragmatism and boldness we can
                    expect from this new leader. His talks with the Yugoslavs and Finns are
                    indicative of his willingness to play hard ball.</p>

                  <p>1. With <persName corresp="#p_SMA_1">Suslov</persName>’s death, <persName corresp="#p_KAP_1">Kirilenko</persName> fading away, and the inception of
                    the <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName> boom, I tasked our Soviet
                    analysts to evaluate the prospects for the Soviet succession.</p>
                  <p>2. In recent weeks <persName corresp="#p_CKU_1">Chernenko</persName> appears to
                    have peaked too soon, with <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>
                    emerging as the present favorite. <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName> has the military clout and seems to be lining up with
                        <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>, but may be positioning
                    himself for partnership or even competition. Under pressure, forced to stick our
                    necks out on a dark horse, we pick Grishin, the 67 year old Moscow party boss
                    and fourth youngest member of the Politburo, and Gorbachev, at 51 the youngest
                    Politburo member, who is Party Secretary for Agriculture, a post which
                    Khrushchev held on his way to the top. <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName> also was deeply involved in agricultural matters on his
                    way up.</p>

                <p>The Soviets make all their strategic decisions—whether to advance or retreat—on
                    the basis of their assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of their
                    opponents. The key element in this assessment is the adversary’s strength of
                    moral-political conviction—i.e., his will to use force if necessary to defend
                    his vital interests. In practice, as the Soviets see it, this means the
                    willingness of their opponent to speak plainly about the nature and goals of
                    communism.</p>
                <p>The Soviet system depends for its survival on the systematic suppression of the
                    truth. This is done by imposing the ideological Party line to justify
                    totalitarian rule and serve the internal security system by setting the standard
                    against which deviationism is measured. Loyalty to the regime is thus determined
                    by the capacity to affirm the falsehoods of the ideology. All must say that the
                        <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is a “workers’ state” when it is not.
                    Everyone must be a good courtier and tell the naked emperor that he is wearing
                    nice clothes. The Soviets extend this principle to the world. Thus, the key
                    feature of “Finlandization” is for the target country to censor itself—if not to
                    lie outright, then at least to remain silent. In fact, the Soviets measure their
                    dominance or influence over another country by that country’s willingness to
                    accommodate the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> by censoring itself.</p>
                <p>As the Soviets see it, to tell the truth about the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is to risk igniting their internal security threat—the threat
                    of mass popular resistance to the ideology, as in Poland. Thus, their highest
                    priority is to jam our broadcasts and to intimidate and induce <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> governments to “tone down their rhetoric”
                    and censor themselves. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s main
                    mission in his talks with <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName> was to
                    get us to do just that.</p>
                <p>When stating that the Soviets will “lie,” “cheat,” and “commit any crime” to
                    further their goals, you lifted a partial veil of self-censorship we had imposed
                    on ourselves for some 15 years. In doing so, however, you showed the Soviets
                    that we have the moral strength and political <pb n="851" facs="0882" xml:id="pg_851"/>support to say that the emperor has no clothes and to
                    withstand the protests of the Soviets and the “courtiers” in the media and
                    elsewhere. Thus, by simply telling the truth, you incalculably strengthened the
                    credibility of our military deterrent. All our weapons mean little unless the
                    President shows he has the will to use them with the conviction that America has
                    something worth defending. Normally, it has taken an act of considerable force
                    to demonstrate this will. President Ford used the Mayaguez incident; President
                    Nixon used bombing attacks in Vietnam to impress this on the Soviets. Yet, you
                    did it in a non-military way—by having the courage to tell the truth about the
                    Soviets. So long as our leaders deliver this message, the Soviets will know that
                    we are not spiritually weak, that we are not Finlandized and that we have not
                    permitted wishful thinking to obscure a clear understanding of Soviet
                    intentions. They will be less inclined to make major strategic advances based on
                    calculations of American weakness.</p>

                <p>To obtain views of your advisors on US-Soviet relations and next steps in the
                    Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force (INF) negotiations. No decisions are

                  <hi rend="roman">II.</hi> BACKGROUND</p>
                <p>You asked us to examine the significance of the change in leadership in the
                    Soviet Union and to determine what opportunities or problems might exist as a
                    result of that change. In particular, you asked that we assess what
                    opportunities or problems may exist in arms control.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">US-Soviet Relations</hi>. Attached at Tab B is the Executive
                    Summary of the study on US-Soviet relations. It was prepared by State on a
                    close-hold basis with assistance from <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> and
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> (although the paper does not
                    necessarily reflect an agreed interagency view). You have already seen this
                    paper. In brief, some highlights are as follows. We expect, on the one hand,
                    limited risk-taking and threats by the Soviets, and on the other hand, limited
                    cost-cutting and peace offensives, occurring along a basically unchanged
                    center-line of Soviet policy that falls between broad expansionism and broad
                    retreat. For now, we should stick to the line that US-Soviet relations will
                    improve if, but only if, the Soviets behave more responsibly. If the Soviets
                    become both more conciliatory and more menacing—i.e., roughly what we expect—we
                    should, rhetorically at least, “reward” the positive and “punish” the negative.
                    We should avoid being outflanked on international problems and outmaneuvered in
                    arms control. More specifically, we should preempt Soviet moves, illuminate
                    Soviet tokenism, signal our interest in progress, cement our support at home and
                    abroad, update our terms for solutions, and prevent the Soviets from thinking
                    they can address problems without us. Next steps could include internal <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> planning, consultations and actions with
                    others, and actions with the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">INF Negotiations</hi>. Also attached are two papers which
                    represent two different views on the INF negotiations.</p>
                <p>The paper at Tab C<note n="2" xml:id="d258fn2">Not attached.</note> was prepared
                    by the Office of the Secretary of Defense. It says that it would be the wrong
                    time to abandon our position for zero missiles on both sides. At least until
                    after the German elections in March, abandonment of zero would worsen rather
                    than strengthen our position. Allied governments would have to shift their
                    position and argue that they will deploy even if negotiations succeed. European
                    opponents of deployments now have a stake in the negotiations because they might
                    lead to a zero outcome; abandon “zero” and their interest will diminish sharply.
                    Also, there would be serious verification problems with a non-zero approach.</p>
                <p>The paper at Tab D<note n="3" xml:id="d258fn3">Not attached.</note> was prepared
                    by State. It says that we need to deploy INF missiles in Europe to re-establish
                    the US strategic link to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. Because the
                    threat cannot be eliminated by arms control, we must deploy. Failure to deploy
                    would be a massive political defeat for the US and the Alliance, with lasting
                    scars here and in Europe. Allied governments cannot continue to maintain support
                    for deployments unless we show we are making every effort for an agreement. The
                    paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of two options: <pb n="853" facs="0884" xml:id="pg_853"/>(1) insist on zero-zero as the only outcome;
                    and (2) propose achieving zero-zero in two steps, the first being equal global
                    ceilings of 300 INF missiles (roughly half of 572).</p>

                  <p rend="sectiontitleital">INTRODUCTION</p>
                  <p>The purpose of this study is to consider what we can expect from the Soviets over
                    the next 6–24 months and how we should attempt to steer East-West relations in
                    that same period. It concludes with a summary of possible Soviet initiatives,
                    suggested US responses, and possible US initiatives. These conclusions are based
                    on analysis of:</p>
                  <p>• the <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> regime’s view of the world
                    situation and of how Soviet interests can be advanced;</p>
                  <p>• the strength of <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s political
                    position and the resources and constraints that define what he can attempt and
                    achieve; and</p>
                  <p>• our view of American interests and what we would like to see the Soviets do,
                    stop doing, or abstain from doing insofar as their conduct affects our
                    interests.</p>
                  <p>This study is based on the long-term framework for US policy toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> established by <gloss target="#t_NSDD_1">NSDD</gloss> 11–82.<note n="5" xml:id="d258fn5">See <ref target="#d203">Documents 203</ref> and <ref target="#d249">249</ref>.</note>

                  <p rend="sectiontitleital">Assets and Liabilities</p>
                  <p>In assessing its inheritance, the Soviet leadership finds major gains and
                    assets:</p>
                  <p>• superpower status and global reach;</p>
                  <p>• a quarreling, economically shaky West;</p>
                  <p>• domestic political stability; and</p>
                  <p>• an economy strong enough to support massive military outlays while keeping
                    popular discontent within tolerable limits;</p>
                  <p>. . . as well as problems:</p>
                  <p>• discontent in Eastern Europe;</p>
                  <pb n="855" facs="0886" xml:id="pg_855"/>
                  <p>• declining productivity, morale and economic growth (to below 2% percent per
                    annum);</p>
                  <p>• the Afghanistan predicament; and</p>
                  <p>• Western—especially American—rearmament.</p>
                  <p>With regard to military competition, the regime finds itself with:</p>
                  <p>• rough overall balance, with Soviet leads in ground forces, long-range INF
                    missiles, and <gloss target="#t_ICBM_1">ICBMs</gloss>, as well as reduced
                    American advantages in naval and other power projection forces and in military
                    technology;</p>
                  <p>. . . but also:</p>
                  <p>• prospective loss of the Soviet advantage in INF, as well as American strategic
                    modernization and restored American naval and technological supremacy.</p>
                  <p rend="sectiontitleital">Basic Choices</p>
                  <p>On balance, <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s successors will be
                    sufficiently content with these conditions, unsure of how to effect basic
                    change, and sober about the consequences of unregulated competition or direct
                    confrontation with us that they will not be inclined to depart from the
                    country’s general historical course.</p>
                  <p>The leaders probably think the economy can sustain roughly the current pace of
                    military effort (4% per annum growth) and international aggrandizement, but not
                    much more. It would take a much graver economic crisis than expected to force
                    the regime to consider military and international contraction, given that this
                    would mean abandonment of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s main
                    achievement: Soviet might and reach comparable to ours. At the same time, the
                    deteriorating economic situation will make the regime cautious about taking on a
                    larger military burden and new international liabilities. In sum, the regime
                    will opt for neither an expansionist surge nor broad retrenchment.</p>
                  <p>Nothing in <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>’s background or
                    character suggests that he would be predisposed to swing widely from <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s course. Moreover, while his position
                    in the leadership is strong—in part because his colleagues want a strong
                    leader—he is bound by consensus, and particularly beholden to <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Gromyko</persName>. These factors also militate against major domestic or
                    international shifts.</p>
                  <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign Policy Directions</p>
                  <p>This by no means implies passive continuity in foreign policy. The difficulty of
                    effecting domestic change could encourage foreign policy dynamism, albeit within
                    the framework set under <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>. The
                    Soviet leaders may see more sophisticated, innovative, agile, and diversified
                    diplomacy as the best and cheapest way to undercut and pressure us, <pb n="856" facs="0887" xml:id="pg_856"/>expand their influence, relieve internal
                    pressures, and perhaps cut the political costs of some of their more exposed
                    positions abroad. They may be contemplating a mix of selective international
                    “opportunity-seizing” and “loss-cutting,” but in both cases with costs, risks
                    and deviations kept to a minimum.</p>
                  <p>The new leadership, like the old, sees in Washington an Administration that
                    refuses to respect Soviet status and prerogatives as an equal superpower, even
                    while—in their view—exaggerating Soviet military advantages. They see us as
                    having raised the costs and risks of military and international competition.
                    However, they may doubt the Administration’s ability to maintain a national
                    consensus in support of restoring American strength, or to forge a Western
                    consensus around Washington’s East-West outlook and policies. They doubt our
                    willingness to respond positively to anything less than a broad Soviet retreat,
                    which they will not contemplate.</p>
                  <p>For some in Moscow, this assessment of Washington calls for a more
                    confrontationist approach, an expanded Soviet military effort, greater
                    sacrifice, and less regard for Western public opinion. There may be those at the
                    other extreme who believe the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> must deal
                    directly with American concerns in order to avert a level of competition and
                    confrontation the country cannot afford. However, while resource constraints
                    will work against the advocates of a major military and international surge,
                    they will not dictate retreat either. Thus, the view most likely to prevail is
                    that US-Soviet relations should be placed in a holding pattern until it becomes
                    clear whether or not this Administration’s strategic approach is a passing
                    phenomenon.</p>
                  <p>Thus, on the whole, with the possible exception of <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>, it is unlikely that the Soviets see much percentage in
                    making major concessions in the hope of satisfying this Administration. They may
                    probe our willingness to do business with them, but their expectations will be
                    low. They are more likely to try even harder to put us on the defensive
                    politically and to stimulate a public and Allied backlash against our policies.
                    In the process, however, they might be induced to take some real if limited
                    steps that would partially meet our concerns.</p>
                  <p>With regard to arms control (notably <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss> and
                    INF), the Soviets have a definite interest in somehow heading off unrestrained
                    competition. Indeed, the leadership may be less than sanguine about having to
                    back up threats of stepped-up Soviet military programs in the event that our
                    effort continues. At the same time, they doubt that we are genuinely interested
                    in agreements that take account of their concerns (e.g., cruise missiles), and
                    their military establishment is in a position to block “disadvantageous” deals.
                    The Soviets will therefore follow an integrated arms control strategy combining
                    propaganda with real but limited concessions, their purpose being to cut off
                    domestic and Allied <pb n="857" facs="0888" xml:id="pg_857"/>support for our
                    build-up while leaving open the possibility of our addressing their concerns and
                    thus reaching agreements. To the degree they succeed in cutting off our support,
                    they will care less about actually reaching agreements with us, since they could
                    then avoid reducing their forces without fear of being forced into an expanded
                    military effort.</p>
                  <p>In general, the Soviet leaders may feel that Soviet interests are best served by
                    isolating and “outflanking” us as much as possible—that is, by orienting their
                    foreign policy away from US-Soviet relations, and by trying to come to grips
                    with some of their problems without reference to us. This would enhance their
                    freedom to ignore our concerns, their ability to weaken our relations with
                    others, and their ability to pursue new initiatives. In INF, the direct
                    negotiations with us are secondary, indeed subordinated, to the task of turning
                    Europe against deployments. Even in <gloss target="#t_START_1">START</gloss>,
                    where they must deal with us, they will try to reach American public opinion
                    over our heads.</p>
                  <p>Trying to operate around the US over the next 6–24 months would represent a
                    necessary “tactical”—and, they probably hope, temporary—departure from the
                    Soviets’ basic emphasis on the centrality of the US-Soviet relationship in
                    managing world affairs.</p>
                  <p rend="sectiontitleital">THE VIEW FROM WASHINGTON</p>
                  <p rend="sectiontitleital">Assessment</p>
                  <p>Our program to re-establish American ascendancy involves rearmament, world
                    economic recovery, respect for international law and order, and the promotion of
                    democratic values. Progress in achieving these goals affects and is affected by
                    our competition with the Soviet Union.</p>
                  <p>• The more successful we are in our overall program, the more able we will be to
                    induce more restrained Soviet conduct or, failing that, to counter Soviet
                    misconduct.</p>
                  <p>• The Soviets want to impede our program, mainly by dividing us from those at
                    home or abroad whose support we need for success.</p>
                  <p>The results we have achieved so far are mixed:</p>
                  <p>• We have succeeded in making the Soviets more cautious but we have not caused
                    them to retreat from existing positions.</p>
                  <p>• We have increased public awareness of the Soviet challenge here and abroad, but
                    we have not laid to rest questions about our own commitment to better East-West
                    relations—questions which the Soviets are quick to feed.</p>
                  <p rend="sectiontitleital">Our Goals</p>
                  <p>Over the next 6–24 months, our chief aims toward the competition should be:</p>
                  <pb n="858" facs="0889" xml:id="pg_858"/>
                  <p>• to consolidate domestic consensus in support of sustained growth in defense
                    spending, and thus to convince the Soviets that they are not witnessing a
                    passing phenomenon;</p>
                  <p>• to prevent further Soviet encroachments;</p>
                  <p>• to reduce existing international problems caused by the Soviets, and to
                    increase the costs to the Soviets of those problems on which there is no
                    progress;</p>
                  <p>• to maintain control of the East-West agenda, the terms by which problems are
                    dealt with, and the standards by which Soviet behavior is measured;</p>
                  <p>• to strengthen our general Western coalition and keep our coalitions on specific
                    issues intact;</p>
                  <p>• to reduce Western contributions to Soviet power and dependence on East-West
                    trade;</p>
                  <p>• to engage the Soviets constructively on issues where our interests overlap;
                    and</p>
                  <p>• to show that our approach to East-West relations is bearing fruit, in the sense
                    that both Soviet behavior and our competitive position are beginning to
                    improve.</p>
                  <p>Because the <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> regime will probably
                    follow a more active and sophisticated foreign policy, oriented away from
                    addressing problems with us and on our terms, and because it may find it easier
                    to mollify others than to satisfy us, we need to preserve our influence over the
                    manner in which outstanding issues are played out. This does not mean that we
                    should alter our general stance: we should remain in a broadly reactive posture,
                    in the sense that only genuine improvement in Soviet conduct will bring about
                    more positive American policies toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. At the same time, in view of the Soviet policies we foresee,
                    we may need to take initiatives to maintain our coalitions and to maintain
                    demanding but attainable standards for Soviet conduct on outstanding
                    problems.</p>
                  <p>Because we cannot force broad Soviet retreat, we should be selective and
                    opportunistic ourselves if we want to cause concrete improvement in Soviet
                    conduct in the next two years. To remain relevant regarding international
                    problems the Soviets would like to deal with without reference to us (e.g.,
                    Poland, Afghanistan, Kampuchea), we have to be, and appear to be, realistic in
                    setting near-term goals. Our long-term goals concerning such problems could
                    become obsolete if we don’t define the near-term progress we want. We should be
                    true to our promise to respond positively to real improvement in Soviet
                    international conduct and reasonable in recognizing what is real and what is not
                    or else we will lose our capacity to influence Moscow and to keep our partners
                    with us. We will assist the Soviets in their effort to isolate <pb n="859" facs="0890" xml:id="pg_859"/>us if we are seen as staking out rigid and
                    maximal positions that we know cannot be a basis for progress, however noble
                    those positions might be.</p>
                  <p>Just as the Soviets may now try to outflank us, we have to be ready to execute
                    our own political flanking movements to ensure that they cannot escape from our
                    agenda of concerns and our standards for responsible conduct and real progress.
                    This means we should consider how to use not only US-Soviet relations to induce
                    improved Soviet behavior but also our relations with other key actors, such as
                    our European Allies, Japan, China, <gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss>,
                    Pakistan, and African Front-Line States. Only if we frustrate Soviet efforts to
                    divide us from our support, at home and abroad, can we induce them to move from
                    shadow to substance as they attempt to reduce the costs to them of the problems
                    they have caused.</p>
                  <p>With regard to arms control, we should above all avoid being left in a position
                    in which Soviet programs are not limited while ours cannot be sustained due to
                    lack of public and Allied support. To the degree the Soviets can convince our
                    own and European publics that we do not want progress, they may succeed in
                    blocking our rearmament while avoiding reductions and retaining their
                    advantages. Our aim must be to avoid being outmaneuvered in this way without
                    compromising our principles of reductions, equality and verifiability.</p>
                  <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Relationship of Short-term and Long-term Goals</p>
                  <p>Even if we succeed over the next two years in preserving support for our
                    policies, in preventing new Soviet encroachments, and in reducing one or more
                    outstanding problems, the basic facts of US-Soviet relations will persist: the
                    Soviets will still have the means and incentive to challenge our interests in
                    the Third World; they will be able to maintain the internal discipline needed to
                    bear a massive military burden; and they will continue to try to undermine
                    support for Western rearmament.</p>
                  <p>If we want to alter these facts fundamentally within the next two years, the
                    approach outlined above is inadequate. Some would therefore argue that instead
                    of trying to reduce existing problems, we should allow them to get worse for the
                    sake of weakening the Soviets. By this reasoning, we should, for example, not
                    help the Soviets find a way to put their Afghanistan encumbrance behind them. We
                    should not facilitate Vietnamese withdrawal from Kampuchea, nor address Soviet
                    objectives as part of the give-and-take of arms control. And we should do
                    nothing to avert turmoil in Eastern Europe—much less in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> itself—that could relieve the Soviets’
                    burden.</p>
                  <p>Others believe that there are several basic flaws in this line of reasoning:</p>
                  <pb n="860" facs="0891" xml:id="pg_860"/>
                  <p>• It seriously underestimates the Soviets’ ability to cope with their problems
                    and to resort to extraordinary harshness to maintain control and avoid
                    defeat.</p>
                  <p>• It overestimates our ability to preserve essential support among those at home
                    and abroad who want to see outstanding problems solved, even if the Soviets
                    might stand to gain.</p>
                  <p>• It ignores our genuine interests in easing human suffering (whether in
                    Kampuchea or Afghanistan) and advancing reconciliation, justice, and human
                    rights (as in Poland).</p>
                  <p>• Most fundamentally, it overlooks the fact that we are in a dynamic situation,
                    dealing with volatile problems which could lead to dangerous instabilities we
                    may not be able to control. Southwest Asia and nuclear arms competition are but
                    two graphic examples. Simply put, while we may be able to damage Soviet
                    interests through uncontrolled competition, we cannot be confident of
                    safeguarding our own. Thus, we want to contain and reduce conflict, even as we
                    force the Soviets to pay a high price for their misdeeds.</p>
                  <p>In sum, having advanced a set of goals for improved Soviet behavior, this
                    Administration should not and cannot now fail to seize whatever opportunities
                    present themselves to achieve them, even if the Soviets can benefit from a
                    lessening of the problems they have created. Moreover, if we can show in the
                    course of the next two years that we are causing the Soviets to behave more
                    responsibly, we will help to establish a durable political basis for this
                    Administration’s approach for the rest of this decade and beyond.</p>

                <head>259. Editorial Note</head>
                <p>On January 10, 1983, President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Ronald
                        Reagan</persName> held a meeting of the National Security Planning Group
                    from 2:27 to 3:12 p.m. in the Situation Room of the White House. (Reagan
                    Library, President’s Daily Diary) No formal minutes of the meeting were found.
                    According to the personal note Deputy Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DKW_1">Kenneth Dam</persName> dictated at the end of that day:
                    “We had an <gloss target="#t_NSPG_1">NSPG</gloss> meeting this afternoon at 2
                    o’clock in the Situation Room with the President. Actually it didn’t get started
                    until about 2:30, because the President was behind schedule. Therefore, while we
                    reviewed the question of whether there is anything new introduced into the
                    U.S.–U.S.S.R. policy question by the arrival of <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> on the scene, we did not discuss the INF issue, which
                        <pb n="861" facs="0892" xml:id="pg_861"/>was really the important, or at
                    least the urgent, question on the agenda. The question has been remanded to the
                    working group that I chair, and it will meet tomorrow, but it’s a little
                    difficult to know what the working group can agree on at this time.” (Department

                  </hi> (S)</p>
                <p>U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union will consist of three elements: external
                    resistance to Soviet imperialism; internal pressure on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to weaken the sources of Soviet imperialism;
                    and negotiations to eliminate, on the basis of strict reciprocity, outstanding
                    disagreements. Specifically, U.S. tasks are:</p>
                <p>1. To contain and over time reverse Soviet expansionism by competing effectively
                    on a sustained basis with the Soviet Union in all international
                    arenas—particularly in the overall military balance and in geo<pb n="862" facs="0893" xml:id="pg_862"/>graphical regions of priority concern to the
                    United States. This will remain the primary focus of U.S. policy toward the
                        <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                <p>2. To promote, within the narrow limits available to us, the process of change in
                    the Soviet Union toward a more pluralistic political and economic system in
                    which the power of the privileged ruling elite is gradually reduced. The U.S.
                    recognizes that Soviet aggressiveness has deep roots in the internal system, and
                    that relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> should therefore
                    take into account whether or not they help to strengthen this system and its
                    capacity to engage in aggression.</p>
                <p>3. To engage the Soviet Union in negotiations to attempt to reach agreements
                    which protect and enhance U.S. interests and which are consistent with the
                    principle of strict reciprocity and mutual interest. This is important when the
                    Soviet Union is in the midst of a process of political succession. (S)</p>
                <p>In order to implement this threefold strategy, the U.S. must convey clearly to
                    Moscow that unacceptable behavior will incur costs that would outweigh any
                    gains. At the same time, the U.S. must make clear to the Soviets that genuine
                    restraint in their behavior would create the possibility of an East-West
                    relationship that might bring important benefits for the Soviet Union. It is
                    particularly important that this message be conveyed clearly during the
                    succession period, since this may be a particularly opportune time for external
                    forces to affect the policies of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s successors. (S)</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Shaping the Soviet Environment: Arenas of Engagement</p>
                <p>Implementation of U.S. policy must focus on shaping the environment in which
                    Soviet decisions are made both in a wide variety of functional and geopolitical
                    arenas and in the U.S.-Soviet bilateral relationship. (S)</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Functional</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Military Strategy:</hi> The U.S. must modernize its military
                    forces—both nuclear and conventional—so that Soviet leaders perceive that the
                    U.S. is determined never to accept a second place or a deteriorating military
                    posture. Soviet calculations of possible war outcomes under any contingency must
                    always result in outcomes so unfavorable to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> that there would be no incentive for Soviet leaders to
                    initiate an attack. The future strength of U.S. military capabilities must be
                    assured. U.S. military technology advances must be exploited, while controls
                    over transfer of military related/dual-use technology, products, and services
                    must be tightened. (S)</p>
                <p>In Europe, the Soviets must be faced with a reinvigorated <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. In the Far East we must ensure that the
                    Soviets cannot count on a secure flank in a global war. Worldwide, U.S. general
                    purpose forces <pb n="863" facs="0894" xml:id="pg_863"/>must be strong and
                    flexible enough to affect Soviet calculations in a wide variety of
                    contingencies. In the Third World, Moscow must know that areas of interest to
                    the U.S. cannot be attacked or threatened without risk of serious U.S. military
                    countermeasures. (S)</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Economic Policy:</hi> U.S. policy on economic relations with
                    the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> must serve strategic and foreign
                    policy goals as well as economic interests. In this context, U.S. objectives
                    are:</p>
                <quote>
                  <p>—Above all, to ensure that East-West economic relations do not facilitate
                        the Soviet military buildup. This requires prevention of the transfer of
                        technology and equipment that would make a substantial contribution directly
                        or indirectly to Soviet military power.</p>
                    <p>—To avoid subsidizing the Soviet economy or unduly easing the burden of
                        Soviet resource allocation decisions, so as not to dilute pressures for
                        structural change in the Soviet system.</p>
                    <p>—To seek to minimize the potential for Soviet exercise of reverse leverage on
                        Western countries based on trade, energy supply, and financial
                        relationships.</p>
                    <p>—To permit mutual beneficial trade—without Western subsidization or the
                        creation of Western dependence—with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in non-strategic areas, such as grains. (S)</p>
               </quote>
                <p>The U.S. must exercise strong leadership with its Allies and others to develop a
                    common understanding of the strategic implications of East-West trade, building
                    upon the agreement announced November 13, 1982 (see <gloss target="#t_NSDD_1">NSDD</gloss> 66).<note n="2" xml:id="d260fn2">See <ref target="#d246">Document 246</ref>.</note> This approach should involve efforts to
                    reach agreements with the Allies on specific measures, such as: (a) no
                    incremental deliveries of Soviet gas beyond the amounts contracted for from the
                    first strand of the Siberian pipeline; (b) the addition of critical technologies
                    and equipment to the <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> list, the
                    harmonization of national licensing procedures for <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>, and the substantial improvement of the coordination and
                    effectiveness of international enforcement efforts; (c) controls on advanced
                    technology and equipment beyond the expanded <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> list, including equipment in the oil and gas sector; (d)
                    further restraints on officially-backed credits such as higher down payments,
                    shortened maturities and an established framework to monitor this process; and
                    (e) the strengthening of the role of the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss>
                    and <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> in East-West trade analysis and
                    policy. (S)</p>
                <p>In the longer term, if Soviet behavior should worsen, e.g., an invasion of
                    Poland, we would need to consider extreme measures. Should Soviet behavior
                    improve, carefully calibrated positive economic signals, including a broadening
                    of government-to-government economic contacts, could be considered as a means of
                    demonstrating to the Soviets <pb n="864" facs="0895" xml:id="pg_864"/>the
                    benefits that real restraint in their conduct might bring. Such steps could not,
                    however, alter the basic direction of U.S. policy. (S)</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Political Action:</hi> U.S. policy must have an ideological
                    thrust which clearly affirms the superiority of U.S. and Western values of

                    enterprise, and political democracy over the repressive features of Soviet
                    Communism. We need to review and significantly strengthen U.S. instruments of
                    political action including: (a) The President’s London initiative to support

                    highlight Soviet human rights violations; and (c) U.S. radio broadcasting
                    policy. The U.S. should:</p>
                <quote>
                  <p>—Expose at all available fora the double standards employed by the Soviet
                        Union in dealing with difficulties within its own domain and the outside
                        (“capitalist”) world (e.g., treatment of labor, policies toward ethnic
                        minorities, use of chemical weapons, etc.).</p>
                    <p>—Prevent the Soviet propaganda machine from seizing the semantic high-ground

                    the Soviet challenge requires close partnership among the industrial
                    democracies, including stronger and more effective collective defense
                    arrangements. The U.S. must provide strong leadership and conduct effective
                    consultations to build consensus and cushion the impact of intra-alliance
                    disagreements. While Allied support of U.S. overall strategy is essential, the
                    U.S. may on occasion be forced to act to protect vital interests without Allied
                    support and even in the face of Allied opposition; even in this event, however,
                    U.S. should consult to the maximum extent possible with its Allies. (S)</p>

                    of its commitment to resist Soviet encroachment on U.S. interests and those of
                    its Allies and friends, and to support effectively those Third World states that
                    are willing to resist Soviet pressures or oppose Soviet initiatives hostile to
                    the United States, or are special targets of Soviet policy. The U.S. effort in
                    the Third World must involve an important role for security assistance and
                    foreign military sales, as well as readiness to use U.S. military forces where
                    necessary to protect vital interests and support endangered Allies and friends.
                    U.S. policy must also involve diplomatic initiatives to promote resolution of
                    regional crises vulnerable to Soviet exploitation, and an appropriate mixture of

                    weaknesses and vulnerabilities within the Soviet empire which the U.S. should
                    exploit. U.S. policies should seek wherever possible to encourage Soviet allies
                    to distance themselves from Moscow in foreign policy and to move toward
                    democratization domestically. (S)</p>
                <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Eastern Europe:</hi> The primary U.S. objective in Eastern
                    Europe is to loosen Moscow’s hold on the region while promoting the cause of
                    human rights in individual East European countries. The U.S. can advance this
                    objective by carefully discriminating in favor of countries that show relative
                    independence from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in their foreign
                    policy, or show a greater degree of internal liberalization. U.S. policies must
                    also make clear that East European countries which reverse movements of

                    and the Caribbean Basin threatened by Cuban destabilizing activities. Finally,
                    the U.S. will seek to reduce the Cuban presence and influence in southern Africa
                    by energetic leadership of the diplomatic effort to achieve a Cuban withdrawal
                    from Angola, or failing that, by increasing the costs of Cuba’s role in southern

                    with China, and to reduce the possibility of a Sino-Soviet rapprochement. The

                    time, U.S. policy recognizes that arms control agreements are not an end in
                    themselves but are, in combination with U.S. and Allied efforts to maintain the
                    military balance, an important means for enhancing national security and global
                    stability. The U.S. should make clear to the Allies as well as to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> that U.S. ability to reach satisfactory
                    results in arms control negotiations will inevitably be influenced by the
                    international situation, the overall state of U.S.-Soviet relations, and the
                    difficulties in defining areas of mutual agreement with an adversary which often
                    seeks unilateral gains. U.S. arms control proposals will be consistent with
                    necessary force modernization plans and will seek to achieve balanced,
                    significant, and verifiable reductions to equal levels of comparable armaments.
                    (S)</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Official Dialogue:</hi> The U.S. should insist that Moscow
                    address the full range of U.S. concerns about Soviet internal behavior and human
                    rights violations, and should continue to resist Soviet efforts to return to a
                    U.S.-Soviet agenda focused primarily on arms control. U.S.-Soviet diplomatic
                    contacts on regional issues can serve U.S. interests if they are used to keep
                    pressure on Moscow for responsible behavior. Such contacts can also be useful in
                    driving home to Moscow that the costs of irresponsibility are high, and that the
                    U.S. is prepared to work for pragmatic solutions of regional problems if Moscow
                    is willing seriously to address U.S. concerns. At the same time, such contacts
                    must be handled with care to avoid offering the Soviet Union a role in regional
                    questions it would not otherwise secure. (S)</p>
                <p>A continuing dialogue with the Soviets at Foreign Minister level facilitates
                    necessary diplomatic communication with the Soviet leadership and helps to
                    maintain Allied understanding and support for U.S. approach to East-West
                    relations. A summit between President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> and his Soviet counterpart might promise similarly
                    beneficial results. At the same time, unless it were carefully handled a summit
                    could be seen as registering an improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations without the
                    changes in Soviet behavior which we have insisted upon. It could therefore
                    generate unrealizable expectations and further stimulate unilateral Allied
                    initiatives toward Moscow. (S)</p>
                <pb n="867" facs="0898" xml:id="pg_867"/>
                <p>A summit would not necessarily involve signature of major new U.S.-Soviet
                    agreements. Any summit meeting should achieve the maximum possible positive
                    impact with U.S. Allies and the American public, while making clear to both
                    audiences that improvement in Soviet-American relations depends on changes in
                    Soviet conduct. A summit without such changes must not be understood to signal
                    such improvement. (S)</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">U.S.-Soviet Cooperative Exchanges:</hi> The role of
                    U.S.-Soviet cultural, educational, scientific and other cooperative exchanges
                    should be seen in light of the U.S. intention to maintain a strong ideological
                    component in relations with Moscow. The U.S. should not further dismantle the
                    framework of exchanges; indeed those exchanges which could advance the U.S.
                    objective of promoting positive evolutionary change within the Soviet system
                    should be expanded. At the same time, the U.S. will insist on <hi rend="italic">full</hi> reciprocity and encourage its Allies to do so as well. This
                    recognizes that unless the U.S. has an effective official framework for handling
                    exchanges, the Soviets will make separate arrangements with private U.S.
                    sponsors, while denying reciprocal access to the Soviet Union. U.S. policy on
                    exchanges must also take into account the necessity to prevent transfer of
                    sensitive U.S. technology to the Soviet Union. (S)</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Priorities in the U.S. Approach: Maximizing Restraining
                    Leverage over Soviet Behavior</p>
                <p>The interrelated tasks of containing and reversing Soviet expansion and promoting
                    evolutionary change within the Soviet Union itself cannot be accomplished
                    quickly. The coming 5–10 years will be a period of considerable uncertainty in
                    which the Soviets may test U.S. resolve by continuing the kind of aggressive
                    international behavior which the U.S. finds unacceptable. (S)</p>
                <p>The uncertainties will be exacerbated by the fact that the Soviet Union will be
                    engaged in the unpredictable process of political succession to <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Brezhnev</persName>. The U.S. will not seek to adjust its
                    policies to the Soviet internal conflict, but rather try to create incentives
                    (positive and negative) for the new leadership to adopt policies less
                    detrimental to U.S. interests. The U.S. will remain ready for improved
                    U.S.-Soviet relations if the Soviet Union makes significant changes in policies
                    of concern to it; the burden for any further deterioration in relations must
                    fall squarely on Moscow. The U.S. must not yield to pressures to “take the first
                    step.” (S)</p>
                <p>The existing and projected gap between finite U.S. resources and the level of
                    capabilities needed to implement U.S. strategy makes it essential that the U.S.:
                    (1) establish firm priorities for the use of limited U.S. resources where they
                    will have the greatest restraining impact on <pb n="868" facs="0899" xml:id="pg_868"/>the Soviet Union; and (2) mobilize the resources of Allies
                    and friends which are willing to join the U.S. in containing the expansion of
                    Soviet power. (S)</p>
                <p>Underlying the full range of U.S. and Western policies must be a strong military
                    capable of action across the entire spectrum of potential conflicts and guided
                    by a well conceived political and military strategy. The heart of U.S. military
                    strategy is to deter attack by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and
                    its allies against the U.S., its Allies, or other important countries, and to
                    defeat such an attack should deterrence fail. Although unilateral U.S. efforts
                    must lead the way in rebuilding Western military strength to counter the Soviet
                    threat, the protection of Western interests will require increased U.S.
                    cooperation with Allied and other states and greater utilization of their
                    resources. This military strategy will be combined with a political strategy
                    attaching high priority to the following objectives:</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">Sustaining steady, long-term growth in U.S. defense spending
                        and capabilities—both nuclear and conventional</hi>. This is the most
                    important way of conveying to the Soviets U.S. resolve and political
                    staying-power.</p>
                <p>—<hi rend="italic">Creating a long-term Western consensus for dealing with the
                        Soviet Union</hi>. This will require that the U.S. exercise strong
                    leadership in developing policies to deal with the multifaceted Soviet threat to
                    Western interests. It will require that the U.S. take Allied concerns into
                    account, and also that U.S. Allies take into equal account U.S. concerns. In
                    this connection, and in addition to pushing Allies to spend more on defense, the
                    U.S. must make a serious effort to negotiate arms control agreements consistent
                    with U.S. military strategy and necessary force modernization plans, and should
                    seek to achieve balanced, significant and verifiable reductions to equal levels
                    of comparable armaments. The U.S. must also develop, together with the Allies, a
                    unified Western approach to East-West economic relations, implementing the
                    agreement announced on November 13, 1982.</p>

                        position in Afghanistan</hi>. This will require that the U.S. continue
                    efforts to promote Soviet withdrawal in the context of a negotiated settlement
                    of the conflict. At the same time, the U.S. must keep pressure on Moscow for
                    withdrawal and ensure that Soviet costs on the ground are high.</p>

                    that the U.S. continue to impose costs on the Soviet Union for its behavior in

                    and U.S. security and economic assistance. The U.S. must also retain the option
                    of using of its military forces to protect vital U.S. security interests against
                    threats which may arise from the Soviet-Cuban connection. (S)</p>

                    Congressional Support</p>
                <p>The policy outlined above is one for the long haul. It is unlikely to yield a
                    rapid breakthrough in bilateral relations with the Soviet Union. In the absence
                    of dramatic near-term victories in the U.S. effort to moderate Soviet behavior,
                    pressure is likely to mount for change in U.S. policy. There will be appeals
                    from important segments of domestic opinion for a more “normal” U.S.-Soviet
                    relationship, particularly in a period of political transition in Moscow.

                    relations. At the same time, the U.S. must demonstrate credibly that its policy
                    is not a blueprint for an open-ended, sterile confrontation with Moscow, but a
                    serious search for a stable and constructive long-term basis for U.S.-Soviet
