                            long entertained that an essential part of plans of Japanese military is
                            to set up at Shanghai independent of the International Settlement a
                            Japanese régime which would control trade and industry in the <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="pg_2" facs="0006"/>interest of Japan. With docking
                            facilities nearer deep water than at present offered in the Whangpoo off
                            the International Settlement, Japanese controlled area between
                            International Settlement and Woo-sung would soon kill International
                            Settlement. Business within International Settlement would no longer be
                            able to afford present expensive administrative machinery and that
                            machinery could fall into less expensive Japanese control. These
                            Japanese plans if carried out would give control over entire trade of
                            Yangtze Valley which would have to pass through their hands.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose for the
                            information of the Department a copy of despatch No. 262 of February 7,
                            1938, from the Consulate at Tsingtao,<note n="5" xml:id="d3fn5">Not
                                printed.</note> in regard to the banking situation in that port.</p>
                        <p>Two main points of interest are discovered in that despatch: (1) there
                            exists the report that the Japanese efforts to cause the release of
                            Chinese bank notes into the market at Tsingtao is based on the desire to
                            effect an exchange of those dollar notes for Japanese yen notes (at
                            par?) with the purpose of subsequently purchasing foreign exchange in
                            Shanghai with the Chinese notes; and (2) the head offices of the Bank of
                            China and the Bank of Communications are evidently offering opposition
                            to arrangements arrived at by the local branches of those banks.</p>
                        <p>It may be noted in this connection that the situation in the
                            Peiping–Tientsin area differs slightly in this particular but is
                            essentially the same in the general aspect. As has already been
                            reported, the Peking Provisional Government has authorized the issue of
                            an unknown amount of bank notes and subsidiary coins by its new banking
                            organ, the Peking–Tientsin Joint Reserve Bank. Participating in that
                            Reserve Bank are stated to be the local branches of the Bank of China
                            and the Bank of Communications—two of the National Government’s three
                            authorized banks of issue (omitting Chiang Kai-shek’s<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d3fn6">Chairman of the Supreme National Defense Council of

                            Farmer’s Bank of China). The authorities of those two banks have to date
                            made no public denial of the reports of their participation, but it may
                            perhaps not be without significance in this connection that the Tientsin
                            managers of the two banks have recently been called <pb n="3"
                                xml:id="pg_3" facs="0007"/>to Hongkong for consultation with the
                            head officers of those institutions. It is taken for granted that the
                            Japanese, working through the Joint Reserve Bank, purpose the withdrawal
                            of the note-issues now current in North China as the new note-issue goes
                            into circulation, presumably by exchange at par. The old local
                            note-issues would have to be retired, presumably, by destruction of the
                            bank notes as they were replaced, but the notes of the Bank of China and
                            the Bank of Communications could well be used, after having been
                            obtained by exchange for paper of questionable value, in purchasing
                            foreign exchange from the National Government’s own banks. One newspaper
                            puts the Peiping-Tientsin note-issues of the Bank of China and the Bank
                            of Communications at Y$115,161,000 and Y$55,840,000 respectively, with
                            the Central Bank of China having a circulation of Y$32,343,000, and four
                            other banks bringing the total note-issue of Shanghai banks in the
                            Peiping-Tientsin area up to Y$207,264,000.<note n="*" xml:id="d3fn1">The

                                China situation. Prospective issuance of notes by so-called
                                Federated Reserve Bank generally impaired confidence because it was
                                feared forcing notes into circulation would drive out national
                                currency which might be collected by the Japanese and presented to
                                obtain foreign exchange. Since over $300,000,000 notes circulate in
                                North China, potential loss of reserve equivalent to United States
                                no [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] dollars. Moreover acquisition of
                                substantial reserves by North China régime would not promote
                                Japanese program by furnishing backing for their new notes.</p>
                            <p>Fear of this situation created acute worry in Shanghai and other
                                centers resulting in the last month in very heavy demand for foreign
                                currencies notwithstanding gentlemen’s agreement whereby foreign
                                banks undertook to purchase exchange only for legitimate demand.
                                Nothing in balance of payments warrants the heavy demand which
                                resulted chiefly from fear of effects of North China defense.</p>
                            <p>Government’s action was adopted after most careful consideration as
                                most practical means to meet such a situation. It was felt that
                                ordinary type of exchange control would be impractical. Measures are
                                designed to cause least possible interference with previous system
                                and it will be noted [they?] expressly state that exchange will be
                                sold at existing levels since it is desired to continue maintenance
                                of currency stability despite all difficulties. It is believed that
                                the Administration will be centered in the forwarding office at Hong

                            the fact that in order to support the new currency recently established
                            in North China some stringent form of exchange control or exchange
                            rationing will have to be introduced. Craigie stated that he had been
                            instructed, after consultation with his American and French colleagues
                            and obtaining their views, to report his personal views to his Foreign
                            Office.</p>
                        <p>2. Craigie’s personal views which he set forth to me and which he is
                            telegraphing to his Foreign Office are as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <list>
                                    <item>“Point 1. While I would deprecate joint action I feel that
                                        in view of the importance of this issue some form of
                                        approach to the Japanese Government is very desirable. While
                                        it is true that such action may not produce any, it is even
                                        more improbable that action by ourselves alone would be
                                        effective.</item>
                                    <item>Point 2. There can be little doubt that, in order to
                                        support the new currency, some stringent form of exchange
                                        control or exchange rationing will have to be introduced. If
                                        it is to be exchange control <hi rend="italic">à la
                                            Japonaise</hi>, it will in practice form a yen bloc and
                                        consequently make it almost impossible for foreign traders
                                        and bankers to secure foreign exchange and consequently to
                                        continue trading. This in turn means that equality of
                                        opportunity would disappear in North China.</item>
                                    <item>Point 3. The Japanese Government have consistently
                                        declared their desire of maintaining the Open Door and their
                                        desire to respect foreign interests in China and to secure
                                        their cooperation in the rehabilitation and future
                                        development of the country. It is obvious that if the
                                        measures which are now being taken in North China in respect
                                        to the currency and the possible establishment of exchange
                                        control leads to discrimination against their interests, all
                                        hope of such cooperation in the future must
                                        disappear.”</item>
                                </list>
                            </quote></p>

                        <p>3. Craigie believes that if a system of exchange control is set up it may
                            work out almost entirely to the advantage of the Japanese and that in
                            order to forestall such a situation some form of concerted
                            representations should be made to obtain assurances of equal opportunity
                            for all. In the event that such assurances are not obtainable, Craigie
                            believes that our respective Governments should as a second step insist
                            upon some system of rationing of exchange which would be fair to all
                            concerned and that in connection with a rationing system some form of
                            international supervision should be set up such as a committee of bank
                            representatives to be nominated by the Foreign Bankers’ Association of
                            Tientsin.</p>
                        <p>4. I concur in Craigie’s views and I believe that some form of action
                            other than joint action should be taken as soon as possible to prevent a
                            situation arising under an exchange control system which would
                            undoubtedly favor Japanese trade and close the door to equality of
                            opportunity which the Japanese assurances to date have asserted would be
                            maintained.</p>

                        <p>179. Tokyo’s 207, March 26, noon. Craigie’s statement regarding
                            seriousness of threat to foreign business in parts of China occupied by
                            the Japanese through activities of so-called Joint Reserve Bank is
                            confirmed by messages which Embassy has sent from Peiping and which
                            Consulate has sent from Tientsin over the past 3 months that the Joint
                            Reserve Bank using silver stocks remaining in North China (Peiping’s 47,
                            January 21, 6 p.m.<note n="14" xml:id="d8fn14">Not printed.</note>) and
                            presumably backed by a considerable yen credit (see Peiping’s 161, March
                            10, 5 p.m.; Tientsin’s 60, March 12, 2 p.m.; and Peiping’s 169, March
                            15, 1 p.m.<note n="15" xml:id="d8fn15">None printed.</note>) would
                            appear to be issuing a new currency linked with the yen which will be
                            declared legal tender in areas occupied by the Japanese. To prevent a
                            flight from the yen through this new currency, Japanese Government will
                            in my opinion be compelled to compose a very tight exchange order system
                            throughout areas of its occupation, and it may <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8"
                                facs="0012"/>confidently be expected that this system of license
                            will be manipulated strictly in the interest of Japanese business (see
                            Peiping’s 176, March 18, noon<note n="16" xml:id="d8fn16">Not
                                printed.</note>) and the Japanese yen.</p>
                        <p>Such conversation as I have had with business men and others, and an
                            examination of messages outlining efforts of British Government to work
                            out an amelioration of the situation, as for instance the preservation
                            of the Customs and Salt Administrations,<note n="17" xml:id="d8fn17">See
                                    <ref target="frus1938v03#pg_626">vol. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                        >iii</hi>, pp. 626</ref> ff.</note> and the preservation of
                            the exchange position vis-à-vis foreign banks and foreign trade, seems
                            to me to indicate a failure to appreciate the fact that, whatever the
                            outcome, conditions in China promise to be profoundly different from
                            those which existed prior to July 7, 1937. If Japan succeeds, Japan will
                            interpret its declared intention of maintaining the Open Door and its
                            desire to respect it as not including steps necessary to enable foreign
                            business and foreign interests to continue to function in China as they
                            have done in the past. The Japanese Government will, I foresee, welcome
                            foreign cooperation in the rehabilitation and future development of this
                            country, but that cooperation will be limited to the supply of funds, as
                            Japan will be able to supply ample personnel at a low cost, and will
                            endeavor to supply material at an equally low cost to meet the
                            requirements. The door will be open to the investment of foreign funds
                            in Japanese enterprises.</p>
                        <p>And the respect extended to foreign interests will be the respect which
                            is given to exhibits in a museum retained because of their historic
                            value.</p>
                        <p>It may be that through our control over silver prices we may be able to
                            compel Japanese to set aside a share of exchange for American banks. A
                            problem of prime importance is going to arise when Chinese Government
                            will be asked to furnish gold exchange for American share of their funds
                            collected in areas occupied by the Japanese in the inconvertible paper
                            of the so-called Joint Reserve Bank.</p>

                        <p>113. Your 207, March 26, noon.</p>
                        <p>1. The Department fully shares your view and that of Craigie that the
                            establishment of a rigid exchange control in north China is imminent <pb
                                n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0013"/>and that such control will probably
                            be so administered as to favor Japanese trade and close the door to
                            equality of opportunity.</p>
                        <p>The Department is continuing to study this whole matter. Meanwhile, the
                            Department offers comment on the suggestions made in numbered paragraph
                            3 of the telegram under reference as follows:</p>
                        <p>The Department feels that some form of parallel representations should be
                            made to the Japanese Foreign Office by way, first, of keeping the record
                            and, second, toward safeguarding, if possible, rights and interests.
                            However, there is warrant for doubt whether any assurances that might be
                            given in reply, affirming the principle of equality of treatment, would
                            be made in practice effective. Moreover, we doubt whether an
                            international supervision of exchange control would have substantially
                            beneficial effects unless there were at the same time an international
                            supervision, directed toward assuring equality of opportunity, over
                            movement of trade and economic activity in general. An attempt to
                            achieve assent to these two types of supervision would probably be
                            rejected. If set up, such supervision would probably produce friction
                            and prove futile.</p>
                        <p>It would seem, therefore, that with regard to this matter, little or
                            nothing would be gained by suggesting and contending for an
                            international supervision. Must we not, in the circumstances which now
                            prevail, choose among courses as follows: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                            concentrate on effort to persuade the Japanese not to proceed, in the
                            development of their economic program with regard to China, with this
                            and other items the effect of which would be discriminatory; or (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) when and as, in consequence of their
                            proceeding with that program, our rights and interests are impaired,
                            continue, as hitherto, to make and to rest upon appropriate protests and
                            reservations; or (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) add to the making of
                            representations an application of some form or forms of positive or
                            negative pressure; or (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) restrict the making of
                            representations to those cases only in which it is absolutely imperative
                            that some action be taken.</p>
                        <p>2. Department would appreciate being informed of the British Foreign
                            Office reply to Craigie’s telegram under reference. Please discuss with
                            Craigie the Department’s comments made above. Please inform Department
                            of any conclusions at which you and Craigie may arrive as to possible
                            “form of action” in line with the thought expressed in your paragraph
                            4.</p>

                                resultant negation of our rights and interests as well as negation

                            <item>With regard to paragraph 3 of section 1 of the Department’s
                                telegram, Craigie and Hall-Patch visualize the proposed
                                international supervision of exchange control as consisting of only
                                one or two representatives of the foreign banks in Tientsin to
                                ensure a nondiscriminatory distribution of available exchange.
                                Furthermore this proposal, in Craigie’s opinion, should be advanced
                                only as a second step. Up to the present he has received
                                instructions authorizing only the first step set forth in my
                                paragraph 1 above and this step is to be taken only after the French
                                Ambassador and I have received authorization for parallel
                                action.</item>

                                of the Department’s instruction, Craigie feels that the most
                                effective form of negative pressure would be an endeavor by our
                                respective Governments to prevent or discourage loans or credits to
                                Japan. In this connection I reminded him of the contents of the

                        <p>117. Department’s 113, March 31, 7 p.m. On April 1 the French Ambassador
                            called at the Department in regard to the question of eventual
                            establishment of exchange control in north China. He referred to certain
                            proposed measures consisting of the recognition by the foreign banks at
                            Peiping and at Tientsin of the monetary system in north China and
                            cooperation on their part with the bank of issue set up by the
                            provisional government. He stated that the French Government was of the
                            opinion that cooperation with the Japanese authorities upon the
                            above-indicated basis should be arranged locally and upon the sole
                            responsibility of the interested banks.</p>
                        <p>The Department in reply has informed the French Ambassador of the general
                            purport of its telegram under reference and that the Department agrees
                            that any relation which foreign banks may have with the new authorities
                            in north China must be solely upon the responsibility of those banks.
                            The Department has also informed the French Ambassador that you will
                            keep in touch with your French colleague in the matter and that in the
                            light of your 220, April 2, 8 p.m., the Department is studying the
                            question of authorizing you to make an oral approach to the Japanese
                            Government in regard to the discriminatory effect of the plans of the
                            authorities in north China for the control of exchange.</p>

                        <p>121. Department’s 113, March 31, 7 p.m., and your 220, April 2, 8 p.m.
                            When you have ascertained that your British and French colleagues are
                            prepared to take similar action, you are authorized to make an oral
                            approach, supported by an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>, to the
                            Japanese Foreign Office on the question of the establishment of exchange
                            control in north China.</p>
                        <p>The Department suggests that in your approach to the Japanese Government
                            you point out (1) that, having in mind the experience of American
                            interests in Manchuria, we view with great concern recent developments
                            in north and central China where régimes are being established and
                            maintained by means of Japanese military impulsion and support; (2) that
                            there has already been press comment in the United States to the effect
                            that discrimination in favor <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0016"/>of
                            Japan’s trade with north China is to be effected by means of a new
                            currency “pegged to the yen and subject to rigid control”; and (3) that
                            inasmuch as there is reason to fear that such control would have a
                            seriously adverse effect on American rights and interests, especially
                            trade interests, in north China, we would welcome assurances from the
                            Japanese Government that it will not support or countenance financial or
                            other measures in the areas occupied by Japanese forces in China which
                            discriminate against American interests. The Department suggests that in
                            your discretion you also make full reservations in regard to American
                            rights and interests.</p>
                        <p>The Department leaves to your discretion whether or not in your approach
                            you should make reference to the situation which has developed in
                            Manchuria as a result of the exchange and trade control there and in
                            Japan. It appears that you have copies of Harbin’s and Mukden’s reports
                            on the subject. These reports indicate clearly that the system whereby
                            the Japanese and Manchurian exchange and trade control laws are not
                            applicable to the movement of funds and goods between Manchuria and
                            Japan is in effect discriminatory against foreign goods, including
                            American goods, inasmuch as such goods cannot be imported into Manchuria
                            without specific authorizations which in practice are frequently delayed
                            or refused.</p>
                        <p>Please continue to keep the Department fully informed.</p>

                            <p>“248, April 15, 11 a.m. Some days ago the Standard Oil Company’s
                                representatives called at the Embassy and stated that they feared
                                some sort of quota system was about to be established in North China
                                with the formation of a North China oil company and asked us to make
                                appropriate inquiries at the Foreign Office. We have made such
                                inquiries orally and informally. In the meanwhile the British
                                Commercial Counselor took up the question on behalf of the British
                                oil interests in North China with the Chief of the Commercial

                                oil suppliers. When asked what those requirements were, the British
                                Commercial Counselor replied (1) protection of the present trade of
                                the foreign companies and (2) a fair share of any natural increase.
                                He left with the Chief of the Commercial Section a memorandum

                        <p>The attorney for the National City Bank in Tientsin has requested that
                            the following matter be brought to the attention of the Embassy with a
                            view to the issuance of appropriate instructions to the Consulates in
                            North China and Shanghai in the event that unduly oppressive exchange,
                            import or export restrictions are imposed in those areas: The Bank
                            understands that the Chinese National Government has imposed excessive
                            restrictions on export trade at Hankow and Canton under which export
                            licenses are required and that these licenses cannot be obtained without
                            production of proof that the exchange has been negotiated through the
                            Central Bank of China. The bank fears that if such restrictions are
                            imposed by the Chinese National Government similar restrictions will be
                            imposed by the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> governments in North
                            China and Shanghai and that if no protest is made in Hankow it will be
                            difficult to oppose such action by the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                            governments, and considers it highly desirable that the Embassy point
                            out to the National Government the undesirability of such discriminatory
                            regulations and endeavor to have the matter adjusted.</p>

                        <p>247. Tientsin’s May 13, 9 a.m. It is understood that National Government
                            has imposed restrictions on export trade at Hankow and Canton for the
                            purpose of controlling exchange in favor of the National Government. I
                            have discussed matter on several occasions with local manager of the
                            National City Bank who is discontented because regulations of Government
                            have resulted in clients negotiating direct through Government banks for
                            exchange rather than through him. It is possible for merchants to apply
                            for exchange through foreign banks, but foreign banks are required to
                            resell such exchange to the Bank of China or to the Bank of
                            Communications. Merchants have endeavored to cooperate with Government
                            and are generally contented with present arrangement which is perhaps
                            best they can obtain under present conditions. Under the circumstances I
                            have not felt that it would serve any useful purpose for me to protest
                            to the National Government, particularly on the grounds mentioned by the
                            Bank at Tientsin.</p>

                        <p>676. Local firms, especially oil and tobacco companies, are bitterly
                            complaining against the exchange restrictions. Last week the Chinese
                            authorities declined to grant any exchange to the two leading American
                            oil companies and to several of the tobacco firms. Apparently two
                            tobacco companies were granted the amounts of exchange applied for but
                            local banking authorities state that this was through error and that the
                            Chinese will not henceforth approve applications for exchange for oil
                            and tobacco companies. Other American firms are also suffering lack of
                            exchange facilities and are finding it increasingly difficult to carry
                            on trade. A continuation of this restrictive policy, while no doubt
                            based on sound financial and political policy from the Chinese
                            Government point of view, is a serious barrier to normal trade activity
                            and American firms are greatly concerned over the outlook.</p>

                            to oil companies because they have been selling oil to Japanese and
                            remitting funds on exchange issued by Chinese Government, and that
                            exchange is being denied tobacco companies because of transactions
                            between tobacco companies and Japanese whereby tobacco companies are
                            furnishing exchange granted by the Chinese Government in return for
                            notes of Federal Reserve Bank in North China which they are using to
                            purchase tobacco in Shantung.</p>

                                the currency program. It seems possible that Japan’s own foreign

                                make concessions if foreign commercial interests could thereby be

                            sentence of your telegram under reference and in connection therewith
                            offers the following observations: <list>

                                    as amongst foreign powers or nationals does not afford a basis

                                <item>The Department, however, regards such controls as severely
                                    restrictive and disruptive of international trade, and in
                                    pursuance of its trade policy it endeavors under ordinary
                                    conditions to use its influence to prevent or restrict the
                                    employment of these controls as protective devices. The
                                    circumstances under which such controls are employed by a state,
                                    however, and the objectives of their employment may not be
                                    ignored. In the present instance the controlling circumstance is
                                    the conduct in China of large-scale military operations by a
                                    foreign power and the ultimate objective of China’s employment
                                    of the controls in question is the continued existence of the
                                    Chinese state as a sovereign power. It is therefore the opinion
                                    of the Department that an approach to the Chinese Government
                                    along the line suggested in Tientsin’s telegram under reference
                                    would not be appropriate.</item>

                                <item>In the opinion of the Department, this Government’s position
                                    in regard to any import, export, or exchange controls which may
                                    be established by the provisional régimes in Peiping and Nanking

                                of the Manchuria Oil Company had called on the three foreign oil
                                companies at Tientsin on June 30, stating that at the suggestion of
                                the Mengchiang<note n="36" xml:id="d29fn36">Inner Mongolia.</note>
                                Autonomous Government an oil marketing company will be formed July
                                5, with the head office to be established at Kalgan, to sell oil
                                products in the so-called Mengchiang area, “that is, in the area
                                adjacent to the Pingsui Railway”; that the capital of the proposed
                                company will be yen 800,000 of which the Manchuria Oil Company will
                                subscribe yen 450,000, the Mengchiang Government Bank and Bus
                                Company yen 200,000, while the three foreign oil companies are
                                offered the opportunity to subscribe presumably yen 50,000 each;
                                that the managing director of the Manchuria Oil Company has
                                confirmed the foregoing declaration in writing to the foreign
                                companies; that further examination will be given subsequently, but
                                meanwhile no information is available as to the plans for the
                                allocation of trade or the brands of the products to be marketed by
                                the proposed company; and that the director of the Manchuria Oil
                                Company expects to receive a reply from the foreign oil companies as
                                to intended investment and participation on or before July 10. The

                                <p>For your confidential information, we apprehend in these reported
                                    developments a definite move on the part of the Japanese to
                                    establish in Chinese territory under their control monopolies
                                    similar to those in Manchuria and as such inimical to American
                                    trade interests; and we consequently feel that a protest should
                                    be made in the most emphatic terms against the organization of
                                    the proposed companies. We could not but view the development in
                                    China of a situation which the organization of the companies
                                    foreshadows as nullifying repeated Japanese assurances with
                                    regard to the maintenance of the open door and equality of
                                    opportunity in China and as calling for consideration of
                                    appropriate means to meet such an undesirable development.</p>
                                <p>The Department would appreciate having the benefit of your views

                                    suddenly and without notice, Tientsin exporters had in their
                                    possession for immediate exportation to American purchasers and
                                    covered by letters of credit raw skins and plates valued at
                                    between $400,000 and $500,000 in United States currency, while
                                    additional unfilled contracts are estimated at $2,000,000.
                                    American dealers, processors, and manufacturers are greatly
                                    exercised over the situation. The sudden and arbitrary manner in
                                    which the embargo was imposed without allowance for the
                                    clearance of contract purchases has placed them in an extremely

                                    representations against the embargo you urge that Government to

                        <p>442. Embassy’s 440, July 13, 4 p.m. Without this Embassy’s having

                            Embassy called late yesterday and stated that Japanese military propose:

                            as those goods can be used by the Japanese Army, and (2) arrangements
                            shall be made for the release for export by the American company of such
                            cargo as is of too fine a quality for the army’s requirements (see
                            paragraph 2, Tientsin’s 121, July 11, 2 p.m.<note n="47"

                            such arrangement, American authorities are to supply the Japanese
                            Embassy four lists of the American company’s holding stocks for export,
                            giving exact figures for the several categories.</p>
                        <p>As acceptance of the proposal would be tantamount to acquiescence in the
                            embargo, the Embassy recommends that it be authorized to refuse the
                            offer and to urge that the embargo be completely cancelled. The Embassy

                            July 6 reported in our 444 of July 6, 7 p.m., and emphasized the
                            seriousness of the situation as set forth in the Department’s telegram
                            under acknowledgement.</p>
                        <p>The Vice Minister opined that the embargo measure had been taken by the
                            authorities of the North China régime. I said that it was unquestionably
                            a measure taken at the incentive of the Japanese military and added
                            emphatically that if the Japanese Government were to take refuge by
                            disclaiming technical responsibility a most unfortunate impression would
                            be created in the United States which I believe the Japanese Government
                            would do well to avoid. I pointed out the time that [had] elapsed since
                            our original representations and urged that the matter be promptly dealt
                            with and favorably settled by telegraph, requesting that General Ugaki
                            be urgently informed of these representations and of the importance both
                            of the principle at stake and the considerable financial losses
                            involved, both of which ran counter to assurances already given me by
                            the Foreign Minister guaranteeing the protection of American interests
                            in China.</p>
                        <p>Repeated to Shanghai for Peiping and Tientsin.</p>

                            <item>You may say to the representative of the Japanese Embassy that the
                                American Government has made emphatic requests of the Japanese
                                Government that (1) the embargo be removed and that (2) pending the
                                consideration of our general representations against the embargo the
                                Japanese Government take steps to effect the immediate removal of
                                the embargo in so far as it affects hides and skins covered by
                                purchase contracts, and that the American Government awaits a reply
                                to these representations. You may say further that the American
                                Government is not disposed to raise objection should the American
                                dealers in north China agree to sell to the Japanese military
                                authorities stocks of hides and skins but that information in regard
                                to those stocks should be obtained directly from the dealers
                                concerned and purchase proposals should be made directly to those
                                dealers. Add, however, that the American Government’s interest in
                                the removal of the embargo arises from its desire to protect not
                                only American dealers in China but also large interests in the
                                United States, namely, <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0033"/>those

                            that it has received instructions from the parent company in New York
                            that they do not wish to participate in any arrangement which would

                            them to operate in China concurrently with any special company that may

                        <p>251. Your 476, July 20, 1 p.m., in regard to the organization of oil
                            companies. The Department approves your contemplated course of action
                            and suggests that you be most emphatic in pointing out to the Japanese
                            Government the utter inconsistency of action looking toward the setting
                            up of what amounts to Japanese monopoly control in the areas mentioned
                            with official Japanese assurances in regard to respect for foreign
                            rights and interests in China and for the principle of equality of
                            opportunity. In making this point, it is further suggested that, on the
                            basis of information which you presumably have received from the
                            representative of the American oil company, you inform the Japanese
                            Government impressively of the very serious effects which the
                            establishment of monopoly control over the marketing of petroleum
                            products in the areas involved will have upon the business of American
                            companies.</p>
                        <p>The Department desires that you make clear to the Japanese Government the
                            grave concern with which we view the developments under reference.</p>

                        <p>134. Since July 18, presumably on instructions of Provisional Government
                            but without formal notice, local Customs have refused to permit
                            importation of radio and wireless equipment without permits from the
                            Superintendent of Customs which will be issued only upon the request of
                            a consular office. Customs informally state that probably permits can be
                            obtained for equipment already ordered. There <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31"

                            oil companies. In my interview today with the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs, emphatic and insistent oral representations were made along the
                            lines set forth by the Department both in principle and in detail and
                            the Minister was left in no doubt as to the grave concern with which the
                            American Government views the developments under reference. On behalf of
                            the Government of the United States, I entered an emphatic protest
                            against the organization of such monopolistic companies which we regard
                            as nullifying repeated Japanese assurances concerning the maintenance of
                            the Open Door and equality of opportunity in China.</p>
                        <p>General Ugaki after listening intently to my representations said that he
                            was unfamiliar with the facts which I had presented but that he would
                            investigate them immediately and in the meantime he reiterated his
                            previous assurances that the Open Door in China will be maintained and
                            that the Japanese Government will fully respect the principle of equal
                            opportunity.</p>

                        <p>482. Our 479, July 21, 7 p.m., North China embargo on hides and skins.
                            The Foreign Office has furnished us informally a statement in writing of
                            which the following is a translation.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Regarding the embargo on hides and skins from North China. In regard
                                to the embargo on cowhides and other hides and skins which was
                                recently promulgated because of military necessity, we have been
                                informed that, as a result of full consideration of the statements
                                of the American Government, the Provisional Government has issued an
                                order that, for the time being, the export of first class articles
                                which are not suitable for military use should be allowed.</p>
                            <p>In accordance with the above it is believed that in so far as it is
                                possible, attention will be paid to the interests of foreigners,
                                since it is probable that the embargo will be lifted on the greater
                                part of the articles which, at the time of the promulgation of the
                                embargo were already contracted for sale, and further since it is
                                believed that the army may have made preparations to purchase such
                                other articles as were already contracted for sale.</p>
                            <p>A formal written reply concerning this matter will be made

                            order July 18th stating that embargo covers “untanned cow hides, and
                            sheep, goat, and lamb skins, but all kinds of fine furs and skins are
                            not banned. We have to explain clearly as follows: (1) sheepskins; (2)
                            slink skins (with hair longer than 25 millimeters); and (3) lamb skins.
                            The exportation of the articles above mentioned is prohibited by this
                            order but other than these, all fine furs and skins, no matter whether
                            previously purchased or bought after the issuance of the ban, are
                            permitted to be exported.”</p>
                        <p>In view of his suggested exemption from embargo of expensive lamb skins,
                            mentioned in my telegram 135, and absence of Superintendent <pb n="33"

                            which embargo is not being relaxed. Customs state that notice will not
                            be issued until after return of Superintendent, probably not before
                            Monday, July 25.</p>
                        <p>In acknowledging receipt of communication from Superintendent, I have
                            reminded him that when I called on him on July 1st, I objected not
                            merely to embargo on hides and skins suitable for military use but to an
                            embargo on any hides and skins normally exported to the United States
                            and that I had asked that pending discussion of this question all hides
                            and skins ready for shipment to the United States on June 28th be
                            released for export.</p>

                            and lambleg plates and all kinds of goat and kid skins but that the
                            embargo continues for the time being on tanned and untanned lambskins.
                            He stated that this means the embargo is lifted on almost all kinds of
                            materials heretofore exported to the United States. He expects detailed
                            and official information will be available in 2 or 3 days.</p>

                        <p>144. My telegram No. 134, July 21, 10 a.m. Although Commissioner of
                            Customs assured me informally on July 19th that authorization would be
                            issued by the Superintendent of Customs for importation <pb n="34"

                            already ordered or arrived at Tientsin, on request by consular officers,
                            and that there was no embargo on such articles but merely a resumption
                            of a former requirement of the Chinese National Government, no notice
                            regarding which would be issued by Customs, a communication dated July
                            28th from the Superintendent replying to my requests for authorization
                            for local firms to import American wireless equipment states that he
                            received on July 14th “instructions from the Ministry of Administrative
                            Affairs temporarily prohibiting the importation of wireless equipment
                            pending authenticated orders as to what equipment may be imported”; that
                            it is accordingly “inconvenient to grant the requests” in question; and
                            that “appropriate action will be taken” concerning wireless equipment
                            ordered prior to embargo upon the receipt of a report from the
                            Commissioner of Customs. It is not likely that the Superintendent will
                            act before consulting authorities in Peiping.</p>

                            north China embargo on hides and skins.</p>
                        <p>On July 21 the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed you orally that the
                            north China embargo on hides and skins had been lifted “except for the
                            lowest classes of hides and skins which are of immediate necessity to
                            the Japanese Army”. On July 22 the Japanese Foreign Office informed you
                            in writing that “the Provisional Government has issued an order, that,
                            for the time being, the export of first-class articles which are not
                            suitable for military use should be allowed.”</p>
                        <p>The Department desires that you approach the Japanese Foreign Office and,
                            choosing the method which you think best adapted to the case, point out
                            forcefully that notwithstanding statements made to you, as outlined in
                            the foregoing paragraph, the embargo on hides and skins in north China
                            remains in force. Please emphasize the fact, as described in Tientsin’s
                            telegram under reference, that it has been approximately 1 month since
                            the sudden imposition of the embargo and that the season for the timely
                            arrival of the hides and skins from China is already so shortened as to
                            endanger their market.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the explanation of the Japanese Government that it is
                            military necessity which has prompted the imposition of the embargo and
                            which may result in certain types of hides and skins being excepted from
                            the order which may be issued lifting the embargo, please point out
                            emphatically that in the opinion of the American Government the argument
                            of military necessity cannot be applied in the case of the embargo on
                            hides and skins in as much as there would appear to be no reason why if
                            there were no embargo the Japanese military authorities might not enter
                            the market and purchase the hides and skins which they require in open
                            competition, and that the chief value of the embargo to the Japanese
                            military authorities would seem to be that it will bring about a
                            stifling of competition and a <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0040"
                            />driving down of the price, thus enabling Japanese authorities to
                            purchase their requirements at lower prices than would otherwise be the
                            case; and that the embargo thus imposes a serious financial loss upon
                            American dealers and consumers.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion you may say that the Foreign Minister’s assurances in
                            regard to the maintenance of equality of treatment in China have been
                            complete and unqualified and that should the embargo be left either
                            wholly or partially in effect the American Government could not but
                            consider this action as inconsistent with the Foreign Minister’s
                            repeated assurances that equality of treatment in China will be
                            maintained.</p>

                            Department’s telegram under reference when there was received from the
                            Foreign Office a note dated August 1, as follows (translation): <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“By an order, dated June 28, 1938, of the Tientsin Customs
                                    authorities, the exportation of buffalo hides, cow hides, sheep,
                                    goat and lamb skins was prohibited. In regard to the above
                                    prohibitive order, the American Ambassador, on July 4, 1938,
                                    spoke to the Foreign Minister and requested repeal of the
                                    embargo. Further, in two <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoires</hi>
                                    from the American Embassy, dated July 6 and July 16, 1938, it
                                    was urgently requested that the above embargo be abolished and
                                    that, as an immediate measure, it be repealed insofar as it
                                    affects those articles for which contracts have already been
                                    made.</p>
                                <p>Thereafter the Provisional Government as a result of
                                    consideration of the interests of foreign merchants, by an
                                    ordinance, dated July 16, 1938, and by the general [<hi
                                        rend="italic">later</hi>] interpretations of the original
                                    ordinance, has removed the embargo as is shown hereafter.
                                    Accordingly, the embargo is removed on the greater part of the
                                    principal exports to foreign countries, and exports of about
                                    $1,300,000, of the approximately $1,500,000 (it was claimed that
                                    the amount was [$]2,500,000 but of this $1,000,000 has no
                                    connection with the embargo) loss claimed by the Tientsin Fur
                                    and Skin Exporting Association, can be exported. In this way the
                                    grievance of the exporting merchants concerning this matter

                                <p>The articles prohibited as [<hi rend="italic">by the</hi>]
                                    ordinance of June 28, 1938, have been interpreted by the
                                    Tientsin Customs authorities to include the following: (1) hides
                                    and leather of buffalo and cow; (2) goat skins; (3) kidskins and
                                    kid plates; (4) lambskins and lamb plates; (5) sheep plates; (6)
                                    slink skins.</p>
                                <p>The embargo on articles covered by items numbers 2 and 3 of the
                                    above list has been removed by the ordinance of the provisional
                                    régime dated July 16, 1938. Further, the customs authorities are
                                    taking the view that the embargo has been removed on the
                                    following articles from among those covered by item number 4,
                                    lambskins and lamb plates, of the above list: (1) lamb plates
                                    (sewed patch of approximately 50 inches by 25 inches), (<hi

                        <p>2. The Customs order of July 16 mentioned in the Foreign Office note is
                            apparently the order referred to in Tientsin’s 129, July 18, 4 p.m.;
                            132, July 19, 2 p.m.; and 135, July 21, 1 p.m.,<note n="55"

                            issued”; further the Customs notification reported in Tientsin’s 145,
                            July 30, 1 p.m., appears not to make exemptions from the embargo of
                            certain kinds of lambskins and plates as set forth in addendum to the
                            Foreign Office note.</p>
                        <p>3. We are withholding the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> until we
                            receive Tientsin’s comment on the Foreign Office note especially on the
                            statement that the embargo has been lifted on items representing
                            approximately 85% in value of exports of hides and skins.</p>
                        <p>4. The Foreign Office stated in reply to an informal inquiry that it had
                            received no report on the issuance of the Customs order of July 30 but
                            that advance information from Tientsin was to the effect that lambskins
                            and lamb plates (selected) which form the bulk of shipments to the
                            United States were to be removed from the embargo.</p>

                            desires that you make appropriate representations to the Japanese
                            Foreign Office in regard to this matter. Following the general lines of

                            you may point out that the embargo on importation of wireless equipment
                            is an unwarranted restriction on American trade interests which are the
                            principal suppliers of such equipment; and that the holding up of
                            equipment ordered before the embargo was imposed is causing American
                            dealers substantial losses.</p>

                            information from the Standard-Vacuum Oil Company to the effect that the
                            visit of oil company representatives to north China was ineffectual and
                            in view of reports that progressive steps are being taken to institute
                            an exclusive monopoly control of oil marketing in the Meng Chiang area
                            (and possibly in north China), the Department is desirous that further
                            representations be made to the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that you consult with your British and Dutch colleagues

                            object of devising a line of approach by you and your interested
                            colleagues, along parallel lines, best calculated to influence the
                            Japanese Government to bring about a modification of the monopolistic
                            scheme under reference and to obtain due respect for the legitimate
                            interests of the foreign oil companies.</p>
                        <p>The Department will appreciate being informed in advance with regard to
                            the character of representations which you propose making.</p>

                                <p>“A summary of the reports from China in regard to this embargo
                                    indicates that both radio and wireless equipment have even
                                    heretofore been articles the importation of which has been
                                    restricted, and for such importation it has been necessary to
                                    obtain a permit issued by the Department of Communications; that
                                    although the Provisional Government at Peiping has recently
                                    adopted a policy of a formal embargo on only ‘all wave’ sets,
                                    this embargo is applied to the products of all countries alike
                                    including Japanese, and there is absolutely no discriminatory
                                    treatment there; that this embargo is enforced because of its
                                    necessity from the standpoint of the maintenance of peace and
                                    order; that it is considered to be unavoidable emergency action
                                    in connection with the present incident.</p>
                                <p>This embargo as is noted above is limited to ‘all wave’ apparatus
                                    and long wave receivers may, as formerly, be imported. It is
                                    further reported that permits for the importation of such
                                    apparatus are easily obtained.</p>
                                <p>Finally, concerning apparatus which was ordered prior to the
                                    enforcement of this embargo, while it cannot, at the present
                                    time, be stated whether or not the authorities concerned of the
                                    Provisional Government will be able to give special
                                    consideration to this problem, it is at the present time being
                                    studied by the authorities in China.”</p>

                                small quantities; that practically all its leaf tobacco was sold in
                                China or Manchuria to British, Japanese, and Chinese firms and that
                                its position in leaf tobacco trade in China was certainly no

                                in purchasing leaf tobacco at stations along the same railway. The
                                Japanese firms in fact are exporting to Japan. The Consul General
                                was adamant in his refusal to give any facilities or permission to

                                months, as have Chinese dealers. While the British firm in which

                        <p>612. Our 599, September 14, noon. In recent conversation with the British
                            Commercial Secretary, the Director of Commercial Affairs in the Foreign
                                Office<note n="71" xml:id="d68fn71">Shikao Matsushima.</note> said
                            that the chief difficulty in avoiding the establishment of an oil
                            monopoly in Mengchiang is that the Japanese authorities in that area are
                            not under the control of General Terauchi and the Japanese forces in
                            North China, but are responsible to the Kwantung army. The independent
                            attitude of the latter is well known and the implication is obvious that
                            the Government in Tokyo finds difficulty in controlling its actions.</p>
                        <p>The British Embassy believes that Matsushima is doing his best to stave
                            off the monopoly and therefore thinks it unwise to press the Foreign
                            Office too hard at present, although the Ambassador contemplates a
                            further protest in due course unless favorable results develop. This
                            explains the comparatively mild tone and substance of the British
                            memorandum of September 7, a copy of which was transmitted to the
                            Department with our despatch 3237, September 14.<note n="72"

                            leaf tobacco constitutes discrimination against American interests

                        <p>339. 1. There is given below the text of a note which the Department
                            authorizes you in your discretion to present to the Japanese Foreign
                            Office. In our opinion early presentation of the note would be
                            desirable. However, before presenting the note, please go over the text
                            carefully with a view to making such changes or additions as in your
                            judgment would be helpful. You are authorized to use your discretion as
                            to whether the Department should be consulted in reference to any such
                            changes or additions. The text of the note follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Government of the United States has had frequent occasion to
                                    make representations to Your Excellency’s Government in regard
                                    to action taken and policies carried out in China under Japanese
                                    authority to which the Government of the United States takes
                                    exception as being, in its opinion, in contravention of the
                                    principle and the condition of equality of opportunity or the
                                    ‘Open Door’ in China. In response to these representations, and
                                    in other connections, both public and private, the Japanese
                                    Government has given categorical assurances that equality of
                                    opportunity or the Open Door in China will be maintained. The
                                    Government of the United States is constrained to observe,
                                    however, that notwithstanding the assurances of the Japanese
                                    Government in this regard violations by Japanese agencies of
                                    American rights and interests have persisted.</p>
                                <p>It is recalled that at the time of the Japanese military
                                    occupation of Manchuria the Japanese Government gave assurances
                                    that the Open Door in Manchuria would be maintained.
                                    Notwithstanding those assurances there was established in
                                    Manchuria with Japanese military impulsion, and there is
                                    maintained in Manchuria today with Japanese military support, a
                                    régime which has progressively established Japanese trade and
                                    enterprise in a preferred position. The principal economic
                                    activities in that area have been taken over by special
                                    companies which are controlled by Japanese nationals and which
                                    are established under special charters according them a
                                    preferred or exclusive position. A large part of American
                                    enterprise <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0053"/>which formerly
                                    operated in Manchuria has been forced to withdraw from that
                                    territory as a result of the preferences in force there. The
                                    arrangements between Japan and the régime now functioning in
                                    Manchuria allow the free movement of goods and funds between
                                    Manchuria and Japan while restricting rigidly the movement of
                                    goods and funds between Manchuria and countries other than
                                    Japan.</p>
                                <p>This channeling of the movement of goods is effected primarily by
                                    means of exchange control, exercised under the authority of
                                    regulations, issued under an enabling law, which provide
                                    expressly that for the purposes of the law Japan shall not be
                                    considered a foreign country nor the Japanese yen a foreign
                                    currency. In the opinion of my Government, equality of
                                    opportunity or the Open Door has virtually ceased to exist in
                                    Manchuria, notwithstanding the assurances of the Japanese
                                    Government that it would be maintained in that area.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the United States is now apprehensive lest
                                    there develop in other areas of China which have been occupied
                                    by Japanese military forces since the beginning of the present
                                    hostilities a situation similar in its adverse effect upon the
                                    competitive position of American business to that which now
                                    exists in Manchuria.</p>
                                <p>On April 12, 1938, I had occasion to invite the attention of the
                                    Minister for Foreign Affairs to reports which had reached the
                                    Government of the United States indicating that discrimination
                                    in favor of Japanese trade with north China was likely to be
                                    effected by means of exchange control and to ask for assurances
                                    that the Japanese Government would not support or countenance
                                    financial measures discriminatory against American interests.
                                    Although the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated then that the
                                    Japanese Government would continue to support the principle of
                                    equal opportunity or the Open Door in China,<note n="74"

                                <p>The Government of the United States now learns that the Japanese
                                    authorities at Tsingtao have in effect established an exchange
                                    control, that they are exercising a discretionary authority to
                                    prohibit exports unless export bills are sold to the Yokohama
                                    Specie Bank, and that the Bank refuses to purchase expert bills
                                    except at an arbitrary rate far lower than the open market rate
                                    prevailing at Tientsin and Shanghai. A somewhat similar
                                    situation apparently prevails at Chefoo. Furthermore, reports
                                    continue to reach the American Government that a comprehensive
                                    system of exchange control will soon be established throughout
                                    north China.</p>
                                <p>Control of foreign exchange transactions gives control of trade
                                    and commercial enterprise, and the exercise, either directly or
                                    indirectly, by the Japanese authorities of control of exchange
                                    in north China would place those authorities in position to
                                    thwart equality of opportunity or free competition between Japan
                                    and the United States in that area. In such a situation, imports
                                    from and exports to the United States, as well as the choice of
                                    dealers in north China, would be entirely subjected to the
                                    dispensation of the Japanese authorities. Notwithstanding the
                                    short time that exchange control has been enforced in Tsingtao,
                                    two cases of discrimination have already <pb n="50"
                                        xml:id="pg_50" facs="0054"/>been brought to the attention of
                                    the Government of the United States. In one instance an American
                                    dealer in a staple commodity has been unable to export to the
                                    United States because Japanese authorities there have insisted
                                    that his export bills be sold to a Japanese bank at a rate so
                                    far below the current rate of exchange of the Chinese currency
                                    in the open market that such transactions would involve a loss
                                    rather than a profit; but a Japanese competitor recently
                                    completed a large shipment invoiced at a price in United States
                                    dollars which was equivalent to the local market price
                                    calculated at the current open market rate. In the other
                                    instance an American firm was prevented from purchasing tobacco
                                    in Shantung unless it should purchase so-called Federal Reserve
                                    notes or yen currency with foreign exchange and at an arbitrary
                                    and low rate of exchange, conditions not imposed upon the
                                    company’s Japanese or Chinese competitors.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the United States has already pointed out to
                                    the Japanese Government that alterations of the Chinese customs
                                    tariff by the régimes functioning in those portions of China
                                    occupied by Japanese armed forces and for which the Japanese
                                    Government has formally assured its support are arbitrary and
                                    illegal assumptions of authority for which the Japanese
                                    Government has an inescapable responsibility. It is hardly
                                    necessary to add that there can be no equality of opportunity or
                                    Open Door in China so long as the ultimate authority to
                                    regulate, tax, or prohibit trade is exercised, whether directly
                                    or indirectly, by the authorities of one ‘foreign’ power in
                                    furtherance of the interests of that power.</p>
                                <p>It would appear to be self-evident that a fundamental
                                    prerequisite of a condition of equality of opportunity or Open
                                    Door in China is the absence in the economic life of that
                                    country of preferences or monopolistic rights operating directly
                                    or indirectly in favor of any foreign country or its nationals.
                                    On July 4 I spoke to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the
                                    desire of the American Government that there be avoided such
                                    restrictions and obstacles to American trade and other
                                    enterprises as might result from the setting up of special
                                    companies and monopolies in China. The Minister was so good as
                                    to state that the Open Door in China would be maintained and
                                    that the Government of the United States might rest assured that
                                    the Japanese Government would fully respect the principle of
                                    equal opportunity.<note n="75" xml:id="d72fn75">See <ref

                                    Service Section of the Japanese Army has formally notified
                                    foreign cable and telegraph companies that the new company
                                    proposes to control all telecommunications in central China.
                                    According to a semiofficial Japanese press report, there was
                                    organized at Shanghai on July 28 the Shanghai Inland Navigation
                                    Steamship Company, to be controlled <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51"
                                        facs="0055"/>by Japanese, the reported object of which is to
                                    control water transportation in the Shanghai delta area.
                                    According to information which has reached my Government, a
                                    Japanese company has been organized to take over and operate the
                                    wharves at Tsingtao which have hitherto been publicly owned and
                                    operated. Should such a development occur, all shipping of
                                    whatever nationality would become dependent upon a Japanese
                                    agency for allotments of space and stevedoring facilities. The
                                    wool trade in north China is now reported to be a Japanese
                                    monopoly; and a tobacco monopoly in that area is reported to be
                                    in process of formation. Moreover, according to numerous reports
                                    which have been reaching my Government, the Japanese Government
                                    is proceeding with the organization of two special promotion
                                    companies which it has chartered and which it will control with
                                    the object of investing in, unifying and regulating the
                                    administration of certain large sectors of economic enterprise
                                    in China.</p>
                                <p>The developments of which I have made mention are illustrative of
                                    the apparent trend of Japanese policy in China and indicate
                                    clearly that the Japanese authorities are seeking to establish
                                    in areas which have come under Japanese military occupation
                                    general preferences for and superiority of Japanese interests an
                                    inevitable effect of which will be to frustrate the practical
                                    application of the principle of the Open Door and deprive
                                    American nationals of equal opportunity.</p>
                                <p>I desire also to call Your Excellency’s attention to the fact
                                    that unwarranted restrictions placed by the Japanese military
                                    authorities upon American nationals in China—notwithstanding the
                                    existence of American treaty rights in China and the repeated
                                    assurances of the Japanese Government that steps had been taken
                                    which would ensure that American nationals, interests and
                                    property would not be subject to unlawful interference by
                                    Japanese authorities—further subject American interests to
                                    continuing serious inconvenience and hardship. Reference is made
                                    especially to the restrictions placed by the Japanese military
                                    upon American nationals who desire to reenter and reoccupy
                                    properties from which they have been driven by the hostilities
                                    and of which the Japanese military have been or still “are in
                                    occupation. Mention may also be made of the Japanese censorship
                                    of and interference with American mail and telegrams at
                                    Shanghai, and of restrictions upon freedom of trade, residence
                                    and travel by Americans, including the use of railways,
                                    shipping, and other facilities. While Japanese merchant vessels
                                    are carrying Japanese merchandise between Shanghai and Nanking,
                                    those vessels decline to carry merchandise of other countries,
                                    and American and other non-Japanese shipping is excluded from
                                    the lower Yangtze on the grounds of military necessity.<note

                                    China and of American trade with China cannot be expected. The
                                    American Government therefore finds it all the more difficult to
                                    reconcile itself to a situation in which American nationals must
                                    contend with continuing unwarranted interference with their
                                    rights at the hands of the Japanese authorities in China and
                                    with Japanese actions and policies which operate to deprive
                                    American trade and enterprise of equality of opportunity in
                                    China. It is also pertinent to mention that in Japan, too,
                                    American trade and other interests are undergoing severe
                                    hardships as a result of the industrial, trade, exchange and
                                    other controls which the Japanese Government has imposed
                                    incident to its military operations in China.</p>
                                <p>While American interests in the Far East have been thus treated
                                    at the hands of Japanese authorities, the Government of the
                                    United States has not sought either in its own territory or in
                                    the territory of third countries to establish or influence the
                                    establishment of embargoes, import prohibitions, exchange

                                    and growing disparity between the treatment accorded American

                                    the United States asks that the Japanese Government implement

                                    the Open Door and to noninterference with American rights by

                                    measures imposed in areas in China under Japanese control which
                                    operate either directly or indirectly to discriminate against
                                    American trade and enterprise; (2) the discontinuance of any
                                    monopoly or of any preference which would deprive American
                                    nationals of the right of undertaking any legitimate trade or

                                    of rights with regard to commercial or economic development in
                                    any region of China; and (3) the discontinuance of interference
                                    by Japanese authorities in China with American property and
                                    other rights including such forms of interference as censorship

                                    1938. Excellency: I have the honor to inform Your Excellency
                                    that I have carefully perused the statements concerning the
                                    control of the distribution of oil products from Inner Mongolia
                                    area made during our conversation on July 21, 1938, as well as
                                    those contained in Your Excellency’s note No. 1035, September 6,

                                <p>I have recently received a report from the Department of
                                    Agriculture at Kalgan to the effect that in regard to the
                                    transportation and sale of oil products in the Inner Mongolia
                                    area the Inner Mongolia Area Committee has already, on September
                                    24, 1938, abolished the order which had been promulgated for the
                                    control of the distribution of oil products in the Inner
                                    Mongolian area.</p>
                                <p>I am informed that by the above disposition of this matter, oil
                                    companies of Your Excellency’s country may, as heretofore,
                                    freely distribute oil products; and I therefore believe that
                                    apprehensions of Your Excellency’s Government concerning the
                                    establishment of a monopoly in that area should be entirely
                                    dispelled.</p>
                                <p>I am further informed that this action on the part of Inner
                                    Mongolia was taken solely from the broad viewpoint of
                                    consideration for the interests of the oil companies of Your
                                    Excellency’s country and of a desire to obtain their cooperation
                                    in the distribution of oil.</p>
                                <p>I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency
                                    the assurances of my highest consideration. Kazushige Ugaki

                                functioning as Minister for Foreign Affairs but will probably hold
                                that office briefly. It seems to me an unusual opportunity to
                                present to him the request of the President and the full desiderata
                                of the United States without going over the head of any Minister, an
                                opportunity which rarely occurs. Furthermore, although he is not yet
                                receiving diplomats, I was fortunately able to obtain an appointment
                                with Prince Konoye at his private residence without publicity just
                                before he went to the Palace for an audience with the Emperor at
                                which there is every likelihood that the new “China Organ” will be
                                discussed. I consider this a favorable development.</item>

                            <item>At the end of my presentation Prince Konoye said that he was
                                honored by the message from the President. He said that in spite of
                                the change of Foreign Ministers there will be no change in Japan’s
                                policy towards affairs in China or towards other foreign nations.
                                The assurances already given us concerning the Open Door and equal
                                opportunity in China will be steadfastly maintained. The military
                                situation in China may cause delay in meeting all of our desiderata
                                but he gave explicit assurances that this delay will be but
                                temporary. He said that he wished and intended to continue to do
                                everything in his power to improve relations between the United
                                States and Japan as he had in the past. He highly valued these
                                relations. He added that he was not familiar with many of the points
                                which I had raised but would study them.</item>

                            <item>At the end of the Minister’s remarks I pointed out that many or
                                most of the conditions of which we complained had no direct relation
                                whatever to the military campaign. The Minister replied that the new
                                “China Organ”, now in process of establishment, is being formed for
                                the purpose of dealing with just such questions and he felt sure
                                that once functioning it would be able to smooth out these
                                difficulties by the exertion of direct control by the authorities in
                                Tokyo over the Japanese authorities in China. He repeated his firm
                                desire for improved relations with the United States.</item>

                            <item>With regard to the text of the note to be delivered to the Foreign

                                Prince Konoye today, we are of the opinion that the chances of these
                                representations producing constructive and beneficial results would
                                be <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0059"/>enhanced if the references

                                quite clear to us that these references are intended to be
                                illustrative of what may be expected with reason to occur in China
                                proper; nevertheless, the fact that the League of Nations has just
                                invoked against Japan the sanction clause of the Covenant<note

                                highly inopportune time to open the way for renewed controversy over
                                “Manchukuo”. It seems to us that to provide an occasion for such
                                controversy would remove all disposition on the part of the Japanese
                                Government to respond favorably to the desire of the President that
                                it take prompt and effective measures to implement its assurances
                                with regard to the Open Door and noninterference with American
                                rights. However, if the Department cannot see its way clear to the
                                omission of the second paragraph of the draft note, we recommend
                                that there be inserted at the head of that paragraph a phrase which
                                will indicate the illustrative purpose of the references to
                                Manchuria.</item>

                                    import fresh supplies of Chinese national currency is refusing
                                    to purchase bills of exchange covering exports and to fix
                                    forward exchange contracts. This measure has been taken to
                                    conserve existing stock of bank notes for its depositors. As the
                                    Yokohama Specie Bank still adheres to its policy of dealing only
                                    in Federal Reserve bank notes at the arbitrary rate of 29
                                    American cents for one dollar Federal Reserve Bank currency, the
                                    action of the British Bank increases difficulties of exporters

                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>With reference to the suggestions contained in your numbered
                                paragraph 5 in regard to the statements relating to Manchuria, these
                                statements as you have perceived are intended to be illustrative.
                                The Department feels that their omission would materially weaken the
                                presentation of the case, and suggests (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                                that you introduce the second paragraph of the text of the draft
                                note with some such phrase as follows “As having by way of
                                illustration a bearing upon the situation to which the Government of
                                the United States desires to invite the attention of the Japanese
                                Government,”; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) that you delete from the
                                first sentence of the second paragraph the word “military”; and (<hi
                                    rend="italic">c</hi>) that you delete the entire second sentence
                                of the second paragraph and begin the next sentence with the word
                                “however,”. Also, you may make such further revision of this portion
                                of the note as you consider desirable. If, however, you feel
                                strongly that it would be advisable to omit entirely the statements
                                in regard to Manchuria, the Department authorizes you to do
                                so.</item>

                            <item>Your telegram No. 640 refers to the President three times. As the
                                Department’s 339, October 1, 2 p.m., as despatched contains no
                                mention of the President, the Department assumes that its telegram
                                No. 339 was received by you in garbled form. The Department would
                                naturally be reluctant to impair any advantages which may have
                                accrued from your oral presentation. The President has been
                                consulted and ratifies the use which you made of his name. In the
                                light of all the circumstances the Department desires to have your
                                opinion whether, in view of your conversation with Prince Konoye,
                                the note could appropriately be presented to the Foreign Office in
                                the language drafted by the Department without there being included
                                any reference to the President and without there being offered any
                                explanation of possible discrepancies between what you said to
                                Prince Konoye and the phraseology used in the note as telegraphed by
                                the Department. In case you should feel that this suggested
                                procedure would not adequately meet this phase of the situation,
                                please give the Department the benefit of your suggestions.</item>

                        <p>Universal Leaf Tobacco Company case. In an interview with Japanese Consul
                            General on Tuesday he indicated disposition to give company permission
                            to purchase tobacco in the interior on three provisions, (1) company to
                            use Federal Reserve currency, (2) company not to sell its tobacco to Yee
                            Tsoong Company which has agreed to comply with Japanese requirement for
                            purchase stipulated amount of yen at official rate, (3) not to stir up
                            tobacco market and raise prices which might prevent Japanese buyers from
                            operating because of high prices. Decision of Japanese authorities will

                                    to lessen the danger to American importers in Tientsin.</p>
                                <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Except for these 50 sets, the
                                    authorities are unable to allow importation of all wave sets
                                    unless changed into long wave. Officials will examine in the
                                    custom house whether the change has been made. The Chinese and
                                    Japanese authorities have no objection to acceptance of the
                                    American proposal to extend the wave length of long wave sets
                                    which may be imported from 550 to 1500 kilocycles to 540 to 1750
                                    kilocycles.</p>
                                <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Importation of parts will be permitted
                                    if importers have no objection to offer written assurances that
                                    they will not be used for altering the character of sets and
                                    will not be used for assembling sets and if reports in this
                                    regard will be made by importers.</p>
                                <p>Chinese and Japanese authorities have been obliged to make such
                                    restrictions in order to maintain peace and order and to check
                                    activities of spies. (Before the present incident happened the
                                    Chinese Government allowed importation of radio sets only when
                                    official permission was obtained and therefore theoretically
                                    there would have been no necessity for the present circumstances
                                    to make the proclamation of July 14 but they made it in order to
                                    make the situation clear.)”</p>

                        <p>Subsequently the secretary stated that, prior to the incident, Japanese
                            importers faced many difficulties in obtaining import duty permits from
                            the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>2. I informed the secretary that the concessions in regard to long wave
                            sets would seem to be satisfactory to American importers but that the
                            requirement that all wave sets be altered to long wave sets would cause
                            the importers heavy loss because such alterations would seriously affect
                            the value and marketability of those sets.</p>

                        <p>648. Department’s 342, October 5, 11 a.m.</p>

                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>I sincerely regret any possible embarrassment that may have been
                                caused to the President or the Department as a result of the garbled
                                telegram and highly appreciate the President’s ratification of the
                                action taken here. I feel that the serious circumstances set forth
                                in the Department’s telegram fully justified a direct message from
                                the President. I gathered from my talk with the Prime Minister that
                                he had little if any conception of the circumstances which led to
                                our complaints and I believe that the opportunity to bring these
                                circumstances directly to his attention, especially with the great
                                weight attached to a message from the President, was wholly
                                fortunate. The fact that the Prime Minister has called for reports
                                from the Foreign Office on every point raised in our conversation
                                indicates something more than bureaucratic formality.</item>

                            <item>I see no reason why any reference to the President need be
                                included in the text of our note to be presented to the Foreign
                                Office in the language drafted by the Department or any explanation
                                of its omission and I suggest that the term “Government of the
                                United States” be substituted for “the President”.</item>

                                in the draft note relating to Manchuria and shall be guided thereby
                                in its final preparation.</item>

                            <item>A secretary of the Japanese Embassy read a statement yesterday to
                                me in regard to discrimination against the Universal Leaf Tobacco
                                Company. After referring to the agreement made between the
                                British-American Tobacco Company and Japanese military last spring
                                (Embassy’s 226, April 12, 9 [<hi rend="italic">5</hi>] p.m.<note
                                    n="91" xml:id="d84fn91"><hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref
                                        target="#pg_307">p. 307</ref>.</note>), he said that the
                                American Company had suggested at that time to the Japanese that it
                                purchase $300,000 Chinese currency worth of foreign exchange, but
                                changing its mind in late May saying that it had given up its
                                intention of buying leaf tobacco in large quantities; that it now
                                wishes to buy without purchase of foreign exchange probably because
                                there is now no need for special protection along the
                                Tsingtao-Tsinanfu Railway as a result of successful Japanese
                                military operations; that the Japanese Embassy and military
                                authorities regard the company as expecting too much (that is, the
                                company is presumptuous); that acceptance of the American
                                authorities’ request would mean discrimination against the British
                                firm; that the latter would then demand withdrawal of conditions of
                                its agreement; that, in regard to the question of purchase of
                                foreign exchange by Chinese and Japanese firms, the fact that they
                                are so purchasing has probably not been noticed by the American
                                company because there is no difference in the exchange value of yen
                                and Chinese currency; that, therefore, there is no discrimination
                                against American interest; and that, taking into consideration both
                                American and Japanese interests, the Japanese Embassy suggests that
                                the American company purchase a certain limited amount of foreign
                                exchange, not so much as that previously proposed, so that
                                difficulties with the British company would thereby be avoided. The
                                secretary stated that if this solution is not accepted he believed
                                the question would become dead-locked.</item>

                            <item>I pointed out to him that the existence of a voluntary agreement
                                made by a British firm with the Japanese military did not justify
                                    <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0066"/>this attempt to force an
                                American company to purchase foreign exchange and that Japanese and
                                Chinese firms were not being forced to buy foreign exchange at a
                                loss to themselves in order to purchase tobacco whereas the American
                                firm would have to suffer an approximately 40 per cent loss by
                                purchasing exchange at an arbitrary rate rather than at the actual
                                and favorable market rate of exchange obtainable, I said that, in
                                seeking thus to impose its requirements on an American company, the
                                Japanese authorities appear to be making an attempt to strengthen
                                the Federal Reserve Bank by forcing the American firm to provide
                                that bank with foreign exchange. The Secretary replied that the
                                American company ought to help the Federal Reserve Bank in gratitude
                                for the action of the Japanese military in making purchase of
                                tobacco possible along the railway. I pointed out to him that it had
                                also been Japanese military action some months ago which had made
                                purchase in that area impossible.</item>

                            <item>If the company actually negotiated last spring in regard to
                                purchase of foreign exchange, the position of the company would seem
                                to be morally considerably weakened.</item>

                        <p>Today in many parts of the world various foreign governments are embarked
                            upon courses of action definitely prejudicial to American rights and
                            interests. These courses of action have force as their mainspring; they
                            are the negation of the procedure of orderly processes. They are
                            resulting, directly or indirectly, in confiscation of American property;
                            discrimination against American trade and American nationals; and denial
                            to Americans of equality of commercial opportunity.</p>
                        <p>In the Far East, Japan has been pursuing for a number of years a course
                            of active aggression in China. As a result of that aggression, American
                            rights and interests in China have been and continue to be impaired. Up
                            to the present we have pursued a course of keeping the record clear by
                            the filing with Japan of representations in protest and in reservation
                            of our legal rights. Our representations have had very little practical
                            effect in remedying the situation. The fighting <pb n="63"
                                xml:id="pg_63" facs="0067"/>continues; American properties continue
                            to be bombed and to be occupied by Japanese soldiers, in the Chinese
                            territory over which Japan has gained military control, Japan is setting
                            up special companies—some of a monopolistic character and some enjoying
                            a preferred position; Japan has inaugurated a system of exchange control
                            which enables Japan to deflect to its own purpose normal trade and
                            commerce and which places Japan in position effectively to discriminate
                            against all non-Japanese trade and commerce; and Japanese nationals have
                            resumed trading on the Yangtze while Americans and other foreigners are
                            still prevented or seriously restricted by the Japanese in their efforts
                            to resume normal trading activities. It requires no gift of prophecy to
                            perceive that if Japan is successful in the present hostilities, Japan
                            will inaugurate measures the net effect of which will be that American
                            rights and interests in China will be subjected to Japan’s dispensation
                            and American trade and commerce will be continued only in lines which
                            Japan itself (or its allies) is unable to supply. Most of the American
                            property which has been occupied by the Japanese military will probably
                            be returned, eventually. But mere representations and the maintenance of
                            our legal position will not serve to eliminate the other instances of
                            Japanese interference with and impairment of American rights and
                            interests in China.</p>
                        <p>Not only in the Far East but also in the Americas and in Europe some
                            governments are pursuing courses of action which have impaired and which
                            threaten further to impair American rights and interests.</p>
                        <p>In the light of this situation, which is becoming increasingly serious,
                            the question arises whether there are any means which this Government
                            might advisedly adopt to make more effective its efforts to protect
                            American rights and interests.<note n="95" xml:id="d85fn95">The
                                Secretary of State on March 31 had suggested to officers of the
                                Department the study of possibilities for commercial retaliation
                                against Japan by American executive action.</note></p>
                        <p>It is suggested that an effective means toward this end would be the
                            broadening of our commercial policy so as to enable the American
                            Government to adopt retaliatory measures in the field of trade and
                            commerce against nations whose actions, whether within their own
                            territories or in the territories of third nations, result in impairment
                            of the legal rights and interests of American nationals and
                            discriminations against American trade. Section 338 of the United States
                            Tariff Act of 1930<note n="96" xml:id="d85fn96">Approved June 17, 1930;
                                46 Stat. 590, 704.</note> gives the Executive a considerable measure
                            of <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0068"/>discretion in taking action
                            against foreign nations which discriminate within their own boundaries
                            against the trade of the United States in favor of third countries. A
                            new technique of discrimination has, however, developed in which the
                            offending nation treats all commerce with reasonable similarity in its
                            own territory but through force (military, economic or financial) causes
                            to be set up in its own favor in the territory of another nation or
                            nations machinery tending to destroy or damage the established interests
                            and trade of third nations. That is the situation confronting the United
                            States in Manchuria and in the Japanese-occupied parts of China proper.
                            The American law which authorizes retaliation does not cover such a
                            situation. In dealing therewith it would probably be necessary for the
                            Executive to ask that the Congress broaden by amendment the scope of
                            existing law and perhaps grant certain additional specific powers for
                            certain express purposes. Such powers might include, for example,
                            authorization to impose special dues upon the shipping of the offending
                            nation, to raise the tariff within specified limits on certain of the
                            products of that nation, to impose duties on products now on the free
                            list (so as to include raw silk) and the like. While it may be doubted
                            whether the Congress would give the Executive blanket authority in this
                            regard, it is suggested that the Congress might be willing to give the
                            Executive certain limited and definitely specified powers.</p>
                        <p>The nature of the powers which the Executive would request of the
                            Congress would require careful examination. There would need to be,
                            also, careful examination of the question whether the grant to the
                            Executive of wider powers of retaliation in the commercial field than
                            now exist would run counter to this Government’s historic commercial
                            policy and long-continued advocacy of the principles of equality of
                            commercial opportunity and of most-favored-nation treatment.</p>
                        <p>It is the belief of the author of this memorandum that a grant to the
                            Executive of additional discretionary authority to take certain types of
                            specified action in the commercial field against countries whose
                            governments pursue policies which in effect result in discriminations
                            against American trade and commerce either in their own territories or
                            in the territories of third countries would give this Government a
                            highly useful weapon in endeavoring to obtain more adequate protection
                            for American rights and interests abroad. Such a weapon would need be
                            used but sparingly. Its mere existence would, it is suggested, tend to
                            have a deterring and sobering effect on certain nations. The broadening
                            of our commercial policy, as envisaged in this memorandum, would be
                            generally uniform in relation to all parts <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65"
                                facs="0069"/>of the world. The question whether the policy should be
                            actively implemented in reference to any particular part of the world
                            would, however, naturally depend upon the circumstances of the situation
                            confronting American rights and interests in that part of the world.</p>
                        <p>The resting of a course of retaliatory action on the basis of the
                            withholding of privileges to a particular country because of the
                            impairment by that country of American rights and interests would be
                            something which the foreign government concerned could understand. A
                            foreign government would have no warrantable basis for contending that
                            it should continue to enjoy in the United States and its possessions
                            equality of opportunity while that government was taking action either
                            in its own territory or in the territory of a third country resulting in
                            impairment of American rights and interests. Also, the course now
                            envisaged would not, it is believed, jeopardize our policy of
                            non-involvement and impartiality, as it would be followed only in cases
                            of clearly proven discrimination against and impairment of American
                            rights and interests.</p>
                        <p>If you are of the opinion that the suggestion made in this memorandum
                            warrants consideration, I would suggest that such further study as may
                            appear desirable be instituted with a view to drawing up any needed
                            projects of law. I need hardly emphasize that in so far as the Far East
                            is concerned this whole question is an urgent one.<note n="97"

                                Konoye, privately arranged, and approached the general subject of
                                British interests in China along the lines of my own representations
                                concerning American interests on October 3. The Foreign Minister
                                gave him the same assurances regarding the maintenance of the Open
                                Door and equal opportunity as he had given me, stating that the new
                                China Board would ensure stronger control over the Japanese
                                authorities in China by the Government in Tokyo and adding that he
                                would study the various points and issues which the Ambassador had
                                raised. Craigie asked him to consider the situation in Shanghai and

                        <p>1. A secretary of the Japanese Embassy called yesterday and read the
                            following statement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“There are three Japanese Leaf Tobacco Companies, Meihsing,
                                    Shantung, and Hotung in Tsingtao all of which have been financed
                                    by a limited amount of capital and so among them there has been
                                    keen competition which often resulted in causing undesirable
                                    effects. In view of that fact the Japanese authorities there
                                    suggested to these firms that they avoid unnecessary
                                    competition. Based upon this suggestion conversations had been
                                    going on for some time among the three firms and decision was
                                    recently reached that the three companies be amalgamated into a
                                    joint company. A report has just been received that an inaugural
                                    meeting will be held shortly. (It is needless to say that the
                                    joint tobacco company has nothing to do with the monopolization
                                    of Shantung leaf tobacco.) As this is the situation it will be
                                    understood that the information that a firm is going to be
                                    established at Tsingtao for the purpose of monopolizing the
                                    trade in Shantung leaf tobacco is entirely untrue. All tobacco
                                    companies whether American or British will have entire freedom
                                    to carry on their business as they have been doing.”</p>

                            had done on October 3 was a direct result of his Government’s favorable
                            reaction. Craigie has lent me in strict confidence a copy of his
                            telegram to his Government reporting his conversation with Prince Konoye
                            on October 11, and since that document reports the interview in greater
                            detail than was possible in our 659 and also since it reflects the
                            present general atmosphere of Anglo-Japanese relations I think it is
                            worth repeating to the Department in full as follows: <quote

                                <p>“Addressed to Foreign Office telegram No. 1178 of 11th October,
                                    repeated to Embassy, Shanghai number 944. I saw Prime Minister
                                    this afternoon and spoke as authorized in your telegram number
                                    661, I added that there appeared to be two main causes of our
                                    difficulties—the British conviction that unfair discrimination
                                    was being used against them in China and the Japanese belief
                                    that we were affording concrete assistance to the Chinese
                                    Government in the prosecution of war. Having given instances of
                                    the discrimination of which we complained, I have said that we
                                    might hope to get the conversations on a higher level by
                                    avoiding recrimination about the past and concentrating on the
                                    future. I then referred to the conversations which had been
                                    proceeding in London before the outbreak of the incident and
                                    gave His Excellency the assurance that His Majesty’s Government
                                    were no less anxious now than 18 months ago to reach a fair and
                                    comprehensive general settlement between the two countries.</p>
                                <p>Prime Minister declared that although there had been two changes
                                    in the portfolio of Foreign Minister, the policy of the Japanese
                                    Government remained unchanged and in particular their
                                    determination to respect foreign rights and interests in China.
                                    In reply to observations I had made on Shanghai and the Yangtze
                                    questions, Prime Minister stated that delay in meeting our
                                    wishes in regard to the first was due to the need of maintaining
                                    order and, as regards the second, to the necessities of the
                                    military situation. It was His Excellency’s opinion that the two
                                    countries should cooperate for the future development of China
                                    and for the establishment of a lasting peace. There were in
                                    Japan elements unfriendly to Great Britain who desired to see
                                    our interests driven out of China, but the Japanese Government
                                    did not share these views and on the contrary wished to solve
                                    all these matters by friendly compromise. In response to a
                                    remark I had made as to the need of ‘fair play’ in dealing with
                                    British interests in China, Prime Minister said he was in full
                                    agreement that basis of our mutual policy should be fair play
                                    both as regards settlement of difficulties in China and in the
                                    wider sphere of Anglo-Japanese relations generally. As regards
                                    China he thought the main difficulty arose from the fact that
                                    this was a life and death struggle for Japan, whereas in foreign
                                    countries the matter was naturally viewed from a different
                                    angle. He concurred in an observation of mine that it was our
                                    duty in the calmer atmosphere of Tokyo to apply to the solution
                                    of these problems a more dispassionate analysis than was perhaps
                                    possible for our respective authorities in China. This would be
                                    his endeavor and he would study the questions at issue. I
                                    thanked His Excellency for this promise and suggested that he
                                    should direct his attention in the first place to the important
                                    questions of the <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0073"/>northern
                                    Settlement area in Shanghai and navigation on the Yangtze. I
                                    touched briefly on the dangers of interfering with the present
                                    judicial machinery in the Settlement and begged him to believe
                                    that if we were unable at once to accept every Japanese proposal
                                    this was not through any lack of desire to cooperate but because
                                    sometimes the Japanese proposals were simply not practicable.
                                    Cooperation for maintenance of law and order implied a working
                                    together for a common end, not the forcing on one party of
                                    proposals favored by the other. I begged His Excellency to start
                                    from the premise that it was the sincere desire of the British
                                    authorities and the Municipal Council to do what was in their
                                    power to stamp out terrorism and anti-Japanese activities in the
                                    Settlement.</p>
                                <p>The Prime Minister said he fully accepted my interpretation of
                                    the word ‘cooperation’ and said he appreciated the need of
                                    pressing on with these questions as soon as possible. He thought
                                    our programme should be (1) the settlement as far as practicable
                                    of outstanding differences in China, (2) restoration of peace
                                    and, (3) general settlement Japan and Great Britain of all
                                    outstanding difficulties on the lines of the proposals under
                                    consideration before the outbreak of the present incident.
                                    Craigie.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>2. In a long talk with me last evening Craigie discussed what he
                            considers would be the most profitable attitude of our representative
                                [<hi rend="italic">respective?</hi>] Governments in connection with
                            our interests in China. First of all, he is convinced that whatever the
                            precise outcome of the military campaign, Japan is in China to stay.
                            Even if military reverses should occur and even if the Japanese Army
                            should fail to reach and hold all the objectives at which it now aims,
                            nevertheless the virility, determination and inherent strength of the
                            Japanese nation and the continental policy which it has adopted lend
                            certainty to the hypothesis that at least for the visible future we
                            shall have to reckon with Japanese dominance over a considerable area of
                            China. It is therefore the better part of selection in our own interests
                            to approach this situation from a practical rather than from a purely
                            theoretic point of view. In this respect, says Craigie, he differs from
                            his own Government which in his opinion is too legalistic. He feels that
                            nothing is to be gained and much is to be lost by legalistic
                            intransigence; that method and manner of approach are all important, and
                            that by adopting a friendly and conciliatory policy and by making such
                            minor concessions as can be made without sacrificing important
                            principles in dealing with the Japanese Government we shall, in the long
                            run, be able to salvage something instead of losing everything.</p>
                        <p>3. Craigie has expressed these general views to his Government and has
                            asked how far his Government is willing to go in following the
                            conciliatory policy which he recommends. The British Government has
                            replied that it desires to keep in step with the American Government as
                            regards degrees either of opposition or of conciliation and has
                            instructed Craigie to consult with me in shaping policy and action <pb

                            been authorized to proceed with the Japanese Government as follows:

                                    interests they cannot expect us to refrain from complaints or
                                    invite our press to desist from criticism: the Japanese have
                                    only to restore what they have taken and to refrain from further
                                    attacks on our interests and tone of our press will moderate
                                    itself. We do, however, do what we can to induce leading
                                    newspapers to refrain from use of unnecessarily wounding
                                    phraseology.”</p>

                            conciliation, Craigie feels strongly that some compromise must be worked
                            out to bring about the return to the authority of the Shanghai Municipal
                            Council of the northern Settlement. He points out that there was a
                            reversion in 1911 to the former Consular Courts and believes that the
                            same reversion could be put into operation now for the period of the
                            emergency, under an arrangement by which the present judges would be
                            retained and would act as assessors, thus preserving the practical
                            advantages of the present system while obviating the Japanese distrust
                            of subserviency to judicial representatives of the National Government.
                            Craigie’s chief argument in this issue is that unless some compromise is
                            soon reached which will bring about the return of the northern
                            Settlement, the present situation may well crystallize in a way which
                            will prevent such return at all. Here again Craigie feels that
                            legalistic arguments ought to be superseded by practical considerations
                            and corresponding action in meeting halfway the two Japanese
                            conditions.</p>
                        <p>(This terminates the presentation of Craigie’s views as expressed in our
                            conversation).</p>
                        <p>5. In appraising Craigie’s views as set forth above, the question arises
                            in my mind whether there inhere to an equal degree in the respective
                            American and British positions with regard to the situation in the Far
                            East all the same and common factors. I do not refer, of course, to
                            their common interests in principles of policy which are <pb n="71"

                                <item>Economically, British investments in China are a part of the
                                    pointed British system of overseas investments which forms an
                                    essential element in the economic scheme of a nation which
                                    requires assured income from abroad to help offset unfavorable
                                    trade balance caused by inadequate food and other raw material
                                    resources. The protection of British investments in China, as
                                    elsewhere, is therefore one of the primary objectives of British
                                    policy;</item>

                                <item>Commercially, it is British rather than American competition
                                    which especially concerns the Japanese.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>6. We should also consider the fact that the respective positions of
                            Great Britain and the United States in Japanese eyes are not at present
                            identical. The present wave of anti-British feeling in Japan is intense
                            and this must necessarily color the attitude and action of Japanese
                            authorities. The attitude towards the United States of both Government
                            and people in Japan is at present one of marked friendliness.</p>
                        <p>7. In the light of all the foregoing considerations, I am doubtful
                            whether the British can completely concert their attitude with ours.</p>
                        <p>8. I do not cavil at Craigie’s opinion that the Japanese are in China to
                            stay and that whatever assets we are going to be able to salvage from
                            the general wreckage of our rights and interests in China, unless we are
                            prepared to exert positive leverage, cannot be salvaged by
                            legalistically controversial approaches. Regardless of its repeated
                            assurances as to the maintenance of the Open Door and respect for
                            foreign rights and interests in China, the Japanese Government will
                            unquestionably be guided, both now and in the future, by practical
                            rather that legalistic considerations. The Prime Minister’s use of the
                            term “life and death struggle” in his conversation with Craigie is
                            significant and correctly reflects the Japanese attitude toward the
                            conflict in China and the aftermath thereof.</p>

                                    525</ref>.</note> I laid before the Department <pb n="72"
                                xml:id="pg_72" facs="0076"/>my views with regard to the course which
                            should be followed by the United States in endeavoring to protect its
                            rights and interests in China. These views have not changed. Although
                            our approaches to the Japanese Government have not brought forth the
                            results to which we are entitled, the discretion which the Department
                            has given me with regard to the method of approach along with the
                            attitude which our Government has taken with regard to the various
                            issues created by the Japanese in China have placed the United States in
                            a more favorable position to conserve its interests than have the
                            methods employed by the British placed the British Government in a
                            position to protect British interests. The method and manner of our
                            approaches to the Japanese have constantly commended themselves to the
                            Japanese Government. Whenever we have found it possible to reach a
                            settlement on a practical basis, we have done so, perhaps reluctantly,
                            but with good grace. At the same time, we have yielded none of our
                            fundamental rights except temporarily and under unequivocal
                            reservation.</p>
                        <p>10. Although entirely mindful of the desirability and need for
                            coordinating action and policy with the British, I would be reluctant to
                            see such cooperation conducted on the basis of our adopting present
                            British methods.</p>
                        <p>11. I have expressed to Craigie my agreement with his thesis on general
                            lines but have told him that I would communicate his views to Washington
                            in order to elicit such affirmative or counter views or instructions as
                            the Department may wish to express or to issue.</p>
                        <p>12. The question as to the use of “leverage” has been dealt with in
                            previous communications from me. Financial or economic sanctions to
                            compel respect for our diplomatic representations depend upon domestic
                            considerations in the United States which we here are hardly in a
                            position to gauge. Naval or military sanctions are highly unwise unless
                            there exists behind them the determination to follow them up if
                            necessary to their logical conclusion. Failing the use of positive
                            leverage we had best continue to follow the policy pursued up to the
                            present which has envisaged, so far as I can see, precisely the elements
                            of attitude and method recommended by Craigie to his own Government.</p>

                            communication dated October 14 from the Superintendent of Customs quotes
                            an instruction from Bureau of Communications at Peiping acknowledging
                            receipt of the Superintendent’s request for authorization to permit the
                            importation of Zenith radio receivers “in accordance with the
                            application” and stating that “the chairman” has now issued instructions
                            “that as the restriction orders were issued long ago, the importation
                            should be suspended and no further permission granted”.</p>
                        <p>Receivers in question were ordered June 22, but import permit application
                            was not made until September 13, the date on which this office received
                            the first intimation that there was a dead-line for the receipt of
                            applications (which, incidentally, was later stated to be September 5).
                            The unreasonableness of this ruling was admitted by a Japanese consular
                            officer who on September 29 assured a member of my staff that this

                            <item>Covington, president of company, called today at the Embassy, when
                                we read to him paragraph 1 of the telegram under reference. He
                                pointed out that there were several important inaccuracies in the
                                statement made to the Embassy at Peiping by the secretary of the
                                Japanese Embassy. In regard to these inaccuracies, he stressed that
                                the company’s offer to purchase $300,000 North China currency worth
                                of foreign exchange had never been accepted by the Japanese; that
                                the company is still prepared to purchase a limited amount of
                                foreign exchange; and that no question of discrimination against the
                                British-American Tobacco Company would arise if the Universal Leaf
                                Tobacco Company were allowed to operate for the reason that the B.
                                A. T. are manufacturers of cigarettes whereas the American Company,
                                which has no connection with the B. A. T., are strictly dealers in
                                leaf tobacco.</item>

                                which was accepted by the B. A. T., namely, to purchase foreign
                                exchange to the value of one-half of the amount in North China
                                currency available for the purchase of tobacco, for the reason that
                                the American Company would be unable to compete with their Japanese
                                and Chinese competitors who are not required to make any purchase of
                                foreign exchange. The company is, however, prepared to purchase
                                foreign exchange to an amount not exceeding $200,000 North China

                        <p>4. I have asked my Japanese colleague whether negotiations have yet been
                            started with the Hong Kong authorities to reopen trade and other
                            communication with Canton and he replied in the negative. His very
                            confidential opinion is that traffic will not be permitted to resume so
                            long as the area concerned has the status of “a zone of military
                            operation” and is not prepared to estimate how long that may be. He
                            expressed the further very confidential opinion that it would be more
                            practical for the Hong Kong authorities to negotiate in such matters
                            with him rather than via the British Embassy in Tokyo and is prepared to
                            enter into such negotiations if and when approached. My deduction is
                            that he has had preliminary instructions from Tokyo although he did not
                            say that. My colleague states also that he had had a preliminary
                            conversation with the Resident Commissioner of Chinese Maritime Customs
                            (A. E. Pritchard) about Kowloon customs collections and this was
                            confirmed to me in an independent conversation with the Commissioner. My
                            colleague told me his staff here was being increased in anticipation of
                            the above indicated and other additional duties. In his confidential
                            opinion the persistent local rumors of an offer of German and British
                            mediation in the present conflict have no foundation of fact. The
                            British Ambassador to China who left here last night on a British war
                            vessel for Haiphong en route to Chungking denied to local questioners
                            that he was carrying or concerned with a mediation offer.</p>

                        <p>1. 1. The American Chamber of Commerce in Tsingtao is forwarding through
                            the Consulate to the Secretary of State a statement dealing with
                            conditions in this city affecting American interests.</p>
                        <p>2. The statement deals, first, with harbor facilities granted Japanese
                            and denied Americans, second, with import permits granted for certain
                            items in favor of Japanese interests, third, calls attention to the
                            banking situation arising out of circulation of North China Federal
                            Reserve currency, fourth, dwells at some length on the subject of export
                            restrictions dealt with in my despatch No. 224 [<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>3. Statement then continues with a section on suggested official American
                            action and offers the suggestion that American consular officers might
                            be instructed to refuse certification of consular invoices for
                            commodities which American firms are restricted from exporting. In this
                            connection see telegram of September 24, noon, from the Embassy [at]
                            Chungking and my reply of September 26, 11 a.m.<note n="14"

                        <p>4. The statement closes with a request for advice on hypothetical
                            dealings with the presumed occupation of property in which Americans
                            have an interest and with possible coercion of American firm by Japanese
                            interests to force amalgamation of a group of manufacturers into one
                            large Japanese company.</p>

                            October 18, 1938, prohibiting the exportation of sheep and slink wool
                            and hemp as from that date. The Department desires that you approach the

                            and express the surprise of the American Government that the Japanese
                            Government should allow the imposition in north China of an embargo on
                            an important Chinese export to the United States at a time when,
                            according to assurances given to you, it is giving consideration to the

                        <p>Point out also that for many years prior to the outbreak of hostilities
                            between China and Japan sheep wool was one of the most important exports
                            from north China to the United States; that the wool produced in north
                            China and Inner Mongolia is chiefly carpet wool in demand in the United
                            States; and that the embargo affects contracts of American firms
                            involving more than 1,000,000 United States dollars. Say that the wool
                            embargo will not only cause financial loss and embarrassment to American
                            dealers in China and American consumers in the United States but that,
                            in as much as foreign exchange is available for imports into north China
                            from the United States and other non-Japanese areas only as it accrues
                            from exports from north China to the United States and other
                            non-Japanese areas, it will tend to restrict the market in north China
                            for American exports and is therefore detrimental to the general

                            north China against the Universal Leaf Tobacco Company. It appears to
                            the Department that the essential facts in the case were presented by
                            you to the Foreign Office on September 26 (reference your despatch No.

                            that the additional information contained in the telegram under

                            by the Company. Unless you feel strongly that the circumstances call for
                            the action suggested by you, would it not be better to let a negotiation
                            of this type be carried on by the Company’s representatives directly
                            with the Japanese authorities in China? In this connection you may
                            inform Mr. Covington that the American Embassy in Peiping has been asked
                            to put Mr. Arbogast in touch with the proper Japanese authorities and to

                            <item>During Covington’s call at the Embassy on October 20, he read our
                                note of September 26 to the Foreign Office and was informed of the

                                understand how the Japanese obtained the impression that the company
                                had withdrawn its offer to purchase “a certain larger amount of
                                exchange,” as the company has all along been prepared to make such
                                purchase. He was inclined to believe, as we are, that the
                                obstructive attitude of the Japanese authorities in <pb n="79"

                                presenting clearly to the Japanese the position which the company
                                has taken from the very beginning. It is that position, we
                                understand, which is set forth in paragraph 2 of our 676, October

                                Embassy in Peiping should at once take steps to assure that the
                                difficulty does not arise out of Japanese misunderstanding of the
                                position taken by the company, and that if the Japanese should show

                                proposition outlined by Covington, to transfer the negotiations to

                            <p>“Tientsin Consulate states wool received at Tientsin far exceeds
                                German and Japanese requirements for wool of that type and that the
                                direct exports of such wool to Japan are too small to warrant the
                                imposition of an export embargo; but the embargo gives official
                                recognition to the restrictions placed on wool trade in primary
                                markets (especially Mengchiang) by the Japanese military. Consulate
                                General believes restrictions probably imposed at the instance of
                                Japanese military in order to acquire foreign currency credits
                                through eventual sale of wool to foreign markets on barter basis. It
                                is reported that stocks of carpet wools totaling over 1,000,000
                                pounds have been stored in Kalgan for several months; but the
                                Japanese have declined to purchase any considerable portion, have
                                simultaneously prohibited non-Japanese buyers from making wool
                                purchases in Kalgan and have denied transportation facilities for
                                wool cargoes from that point to Tientsin when destined for
                                non-Japanese consignees. The Consulate observes that removal of the
                                export embargo would be of only slight benefit so long as exporters
                                are denied free access to the primary wool <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80"

                                facilities from those markets to Tientsin.</p>

                                Inasmuch as there is in North China a large amount of native wool
                                used in the production locally of woolen yarn, cloth and blankets
                                (as well as carpets), it is possible the Department in the first
                                sentence of section 2 of its telegram intended not wool ‘produced

                        <p>710. 1. My initial interview today with the new Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs<note n="19" xml:id="d102fn19">Hachiro Arita.</note> was on
                            his part [of] a negative and therefore of an unsatisfactory character.
                            After the amenities as between two old friends, I referred to the
                            assurances expressed to me by Arita’s three predecessors in vain [<hi
                                rend="italic">turn</hi>] to the effect that the foreign policy of
                            the Japanese Government would undergo no change during their respective
                            administrations and that American rights and interests in China would be
                            respected and the Open Door and equal opportunity supported. I then
                            inquired whether the new Minister would renew those assurances.</p>
                        <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0085"/>
                        <p>2. Arita replied that when he was formerly Foreign Minister<note n="20"
                                xml:id="d102fn20">April 1936–January 1937.</note> the attitude of
                            the Japanese people towards the United States was particularly friendly
                            and that it is still friendly today, but that in the meantime the
                            attitude in the United States towards Japan has considerably altered due
                            to things that have occurred in China. He supposed that by reading
                            recent comments in the Japanese press I have gleaned some comprehension
                            of the present attitude of the Japanese people in that connection. The
                            Minister said that in estimating opinion in his own country he must
                            proceed slowly and “with great prudence”.</p>
                        <p>3. The Minister then referred to our note of October 6<note n="21"
                                xml:id="d102fn21"><ref target="frus1931-41v01#pg_785"><hi

                                        <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 785</ref>.</note> which he
                            said he understood conveyed the attitude of the American Government
                            towards the situation in China but added that he had not yet had time to
                            read it. I urged him to do so forthwith because without familiarities of
                                [<hi rend="italic">familiarity with</hi>] the contents of that note
                            he could not appreciate the nature and extent of the difficulties
                            between our two countries.</p>
                        <p>4. At this point the Minister referred to the public address of the Prime
                            Minister on November 3<note n="22" xml:id="d102fn22"><ref
                                    target="frus1931-41v01#pg_478"><hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., p.
                                    478</ref>.</note> as an indication of Japanese policy. I
                            immediately replied that we had carefully studied that address but that
                            portions of it required interpretations and I asked specifically whether
                            he was in a position to interpret the following excerpt: “Japan does not
                            reject cooperation with other powers, neither intends to damage the
                            interests of third powers. If such nations understand the true intention
                            of Japan and adopt policies suitable for the new conditions, Japan does
                            not hesitate to cooperate with them for the sake of peace in the
                            Orient.” I asked what policies “suitable for the new conditions” the
                            Prime Minister had in mind. Arita replied that he thought it important
                            that we should have a long talk concerning all these matters and that he
                            would be better prepared for such a talk after he had been a little
                            longer in office. He repeated the view that he must proceed slowly and
                            that the situation is “very difficult”. I asked whether he would see me
                            as soon as he returns from reporting at the National Shrine at Ise
                            whither he proceeds tonight. He replied that he needed a little more
                            time but hoped that we could have the talk sometime next week.</p>
                        <p>5. On my stating that these matters are urgent and that they are so
                            regarded by my Government, Arita counselled patience and added that if
                            we should press for an immediate reply to our note of October 6 he was
                            afraid that the Japanese reply would not be satisfactory. He repeated
                            and emphasized the word “patience”.</p>
                        <p>6. I thereupon informed the Minister that I must bring specifically and
                            urgently to his attention one phase of the situation dealt with in <pb

                                        >i</hi>, p. 794</ref>.</note> I told the Minister that my
                            Government would not be satisfied with an indefinite reply and I pressed
                            him for a favorable answer including the naming of an early date for the
                            withdrawal of restrictions on freedom of navigation on the Yangtze River
                            below Hankow. The Minister was non-committal.</p>

                        <p>711. Tomorrow morning Fleisher will telephone to the New York <hi
                                rend="italic">Herald Tribune</hi> a long statement which will be
                            attributed to a high Japanese authority in a position of responsibility.
                            The source of the statement is Yoshizawa, Chief of the American Bureau
                            of the Foreign Office, who requested that his name be withheld from
                            publication but expressed to Fleisher the desire that his remarks be
                            given full publicity in the United States. Among other points the
                            statement says that there is no truth in the current press reports that
                            Japan will denounce the Nine Power Treaty or that Japan will ask for
                            revision of the treaty because no revision could satisfy all parties
                            concerned. Yoshizawa opined that the treaty will eventually die a
                            natural death.</p>
                        <p>With regard to our note of October 6, Yoshizawa said that the Japanese
                            Government was unfavorably surprised at its publication without prior
                            consultation.</p>
                        <p>Fleisher is to send me the text of his despatch but I assume that the <hi

                            results were achieved, primarily because of the inability of the
                            Japanese side to give assurance that the purchase of $200,000 North
                            China currency at this time would preclude subsequent similar demands by
                            the Japanese military regardless of the company’s business needs and the
                            conditions under which its Japanese and other competitors operate. The
                            Japanese authorities were quoted as saying that American firms engaged
                            in business in China would be expected to purchase local currency in
                            exchange for United States dollars at the official rate.</p>

                            will say that the principles of the Open Door and equality of
                            opportunity were originally intended to be applicable only in the
                            economic field and therefore may not serve as a basis for intervention
                            by the Western Powers in political relations between Japan and China;
                            that Japan has made secure its political paramountcy in the Far East and
                            is setting up a new political structure through close association of
                            late with Manchukuo and China; and that “recognition” by any other
                            interested power of these two new developments must be a condition
                            precedent to fulfillment of Japanese assurances with regard to the
                            extension of the above mentioned principles to the economic interests in

                            Consulate General, in conversation with officers of my staff on November
                            7, stated that all radio receivers ordered prior to imposition of
                            embargo, including Zenith, would be admitted, provided Tientsin dealers
                            would inform “some authority” (such as the Commissioner of Customs) the
                            name and address of each purchaser after the sale of a receiver, which
                            interested American importers state they are willing to do. As pointed

                        <p>387. Your 711, November 7, 8 p.m. With reference to Yoshizawa’s
                            observations regarding the publication of our note of October 6, the
                            Department suggests that the Embassy in its discretion may care to avail
                            itself of a convenient opportunity to point out orally to Yoshizawa that
                            while it is realized that publication of the note might create problems
                            for the Japanese Foreign Office, this Government must also take into
                            account its own situation and the interests of the American people; that
                            between the time the note was presented to the Japanese Government and
                            the time the note was published there elapsed approximately 3 weeks;
                            that during that period and for many weeks prior thereto the Department
                            was being pressed by interested American individuals and organizations
                            both in the United States and in the Far East for a clear indication of
                            this Government’s position in regard to the matter of Japanese
                            infraction especially of the principle of equality of opportunity in
                            China; and that while this Government would expect usually to consult
                            the Japanese Government in regard to the question of publishing a
                            document emanating from that Government, there can be no warrant in
                            circumstances such as prevail in and attend this case for questioning
                            either the conventional right or the propriety of this Government’s
                            action in making public the note which emanated from it.</p>

                            that the German Embassies at Peiping and Tokyo had lodged protests with

                        <p>A Japanese official at a consular body meeting at Tientsin expressed the
                            confidential view that modification of the wool embargo, which was
                            imposed at the instigation of the military, was unlikely but he stated
                            that efforts to permit the export of wool already contracted for were
                            being made. It is known that the German Counselor at Peiping in orally
                            discussing this matter with an official of the Japanese Embassy
                            threatened to recommend to his Government that shipments of certain much
                            needed machinery on order in Germany for export to Japan be withheld

                        <p>732. Our 710, November 7, 5 p.m., paragraph 5. The Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs told me at luncheon today that we shall probably receive on
                            Saturday November 19 the Japanese reply to our note of October 6
                            concerning American interests in China and that he will receive me for
                            our contemplated conversation on the following Monday, November 21.</p>
                        <p>I shall endeavor to have the note translated and cabled to Washington in
                            time for the Department to send me any urgent instructions for use in my
                            talk with the Minister on Monday, the exact hour for which has not yet

                        <p>In the meantime Arita has said to Dooman that he would like to have a

                            official formality but “as between two old friends”. I am entirely in
                            favor of this procedure because the Minister will undoubtedly talk more
                            openly and “off the record” to Dooman than he would or could with the
                            American Ambassador and we may expect that interesting disclosures
                            concerning future Japanese policy will emerge from that conversation in

                                facs="0091"/>interview with me. The result of Dooman’s talk will be
                            cabled immediately in order to give the Department still more material
                            upon which to base instructions for my guidance on Monday. I hope that
                            the decks may be cleared so that I may receive the Department’s comments
                            or instructions in plenty of time before my own conversation on that
                            day.</p>

                        <p>735. Our 732, November 16, 3 p.m.</p>
                        <p>1. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has now made an appointment to see me
                            at 3:30 o’clock Monday afternoon, November 21.</p>
                        <p>2. My British colleague had an hour and a half with the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs this afternoon to discuss the general subject of Japan’s
                            policy in China with special reference to foreign interests, and since
                            this talk probably presages the general line that the Minister will
                            follow in his conversation with me on Monday I am cabling below in full
                            Craigie’s telegraphic report of his interview which he will send to
                            London tonight textually as follows. <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>3. “16th November 1938. I had a long conversation this evening
                                    with Minister for Foreign Affairs in regard to Japanese proposal
                                    for a ‘new order’ for China. His Excellency began by saying that
                                    he would prefer to reserve any official observations until after
                                    the despatch of the Japanese reply to the American note October
                                    6th but he was ready to give me quite frankly an outline of his
                                    personal views in what should be regarded as an unofficial
                                    conversation.</p>
                                <p>At the outset of the conversation I referred to the specific
                                    assurances of respect for British rights and interests and for
                                    the principle of equal opportunity which I had received from His
                                    Excellency’s predecessors and said that the indications that
                                    these promises were not to be made good were naturally creating
                                    a most unfavorable impression in my country. I hoped that His
                                    Excellency would enable me to correct this impression. Mr. Arita
                                    replied that it was necessary to recognize that a complete
                                    change had come over the situation in China and that assurances
                                    given earlier might not be wholly applicable to the new
                                    situation which had developed. Moreover, public opinion in Japan
                                    now insistently demanded a policy based on the proposed
                                    tripartite bloc. I observed that the assurances given had been
                                    without reservation or limit of time and that in my opinion the
                                    policy of restraint and neutrality pursued by His Majesty’s
                                    Government must to some extent at least have been determined by
                                    reliance on the categorical assurances we had consistently
                                    received. I felt that this was an aspect of the question which
                                    the Japanese Government should very carefully consider
                                    particularly in connection with the answer which <pb n="88"
                                        xml:id="pg_88" facs="0092"/>the Japanese Government were
                                    preparing to the American note. Mr. Arita replied that these
                                    considerations were being borne in mind. Subsequent talk was
                                    discussive [<hi rend="italic">discursive?</hi>] but may be
                                    summarized as follows.</p>

                                        Japan aimed at the eventual exclusion of foreign trade from
                                        China. Such a scheme would in any case be quite
                                        impracticable even if it were desired by Japan.</item>

                                    <item>His Excellency repeated his earlier statement in regard to
                                        possibility of economic boycott or sanctions against
                                        countries having slender economic resources. He instanced
                                        the powerful economic groups already in existence such as
                                        the British Empire, the United States of America (with which
                                        he linked Latin-America) and Russia maintaining that the
                                        only way to secure some measure of economic appeasement in
                                        the world was that the smaller countries should also be
                                        grouped into similar economic blocs.</item>

                                    <item>On the questions of the ‘Open Door’ and equality of
                                        opportunity, he felt that it was unfair that these
                                        principles should apply to China only. It was time that in
                                        this respect China should be put on an equality with other
                                        powers. He hoped that the powers interested in China would
                                        not take too narrow or technical a view of this matter but
                                        would take cognizance of the economic changes in and needs
                                        of the Far East and endeavor to settle all these matters in
                                        a practical manner. Japanese Government did not intend to
                                        demand a modification of the existing treaty position but
                                        they hoped that other powers would come forward with
                                        proposals which, while taking due account of Japan’s needs,
                                        would nevertheless satisfy their own requirements in
                                        China.</item>

                                    <item>As regards our existing grievances against actions of the
                                        Japanese naval and military authorities in China, Mr. Arita
                                        seemed inclined to recognize the force of my argument that
                                        such actions, by creating a deep seated resentment and
                                        suspicion in interested foreign countries, were not
                                        calculated to predispose those countries in favor of what he
                                        had termed a ‘practical’ solution of the economic problem.
                                        His Excellency said that he was doing all in his power to
                                        meet our desiderata and I drew his attention particularly to
                                        the important questions of the navigation on the Yangtze and
                                        restoration of the northern Settlement area.</item>

                                <p>In the course of this long conversation I furnished the obvious
                                    replies to many of Minister for Foreign Affairs’ arguments. In
                                    particular I drew attention to the dangers inherent in the
                                    system of economic blocs even from Japan’s point of view since,
                                    by following the mirage of a monopolistic system within a
                                    Japan–China–Manchukuo bloc, she might be risking the realities
                                    of her existing very profitable trade with the other economic
                                    entities he had mentioned. I also strongly denied that the
                                    principles of the ‘Open Door’ and equality of opportunity was
                                    applied to China only. After mentioning the equality of
                                    opportunity available on our own market, the principles of the
                                    most-favored-nation on which our commercial treaties were based
                                    and the absence of any trade discrimination against Japan <pb
                                        n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0093"/>in those countries which
                                    provided her best markets, I expressed personal opinion that the
                                    British Government would not wish to hold a free and independent
                                    China to any particular economic system of which she might
                                    disapprove, but proposals from a China, of which one-third was
                                    controlled by Japan and the fruits of which were intended
                                    primarily to benefit Japan, would obviously receive a very
                                    different reception.</p>
                                <p>In leaving I thanked His Excellency for his frank statement and
                                    we both agreed that only good could come of such talks designed
                                    to elucidate exactly what was in the minds of the Japanese
                                    Government on this important question.” Craigie telegram ends
                                    here.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>4. Craigie saw me immediately after his conference with the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs this afternoon and in describing the interview said that
                            he felt encouraged thereby because it at least indicated a desire on the
                            part of the Japanese Government to reach some practical and reasonable
                            solution of the difficulties with the powers. I pointed out to Craigie
                            the utter fallacy of the Minister’s observation that the principle of
                            the Open Door was being made to apply only to China and cited as
                            examples a variety of instances where controversy over this very
                            principle had arisen in times between Great Britain and the United
                            States, now fortunately largely allayed. Craigie for his part was
                            impressed with the Minister’s suggestion that other powers should come
                            forward with proposals for revising the present treaty position, Arita
                            obviously having tacitly in mind the Nine Power Treaty.</p>
                        <p>5. I trust that the foregoing report may prove useful to the Department
                            as preliminary material in commencing to draw up practical observations
                            or instructions for guidance in my conversation with the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs on Monday which I hope can be cabled me at latest by
                            Sunday noon in Washington. On the other hand, if the time proves to be
                            too short, I can merely listen to the Minister’s remarks without
                            immediate rebuttal and report them to Washington for subsequent
                            instructions.</p>

                        <p>389. Your 732, November 16, 3 p.m. I shall await with keen interest the
                            Japanese reply to our note of October 6 concerning American interests in
                            China and the reports of your and Dooman’s contemplated conversations
                            with the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                        <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0094"/>
                        <p>I am sure you realize that the Department desires to be as helpful as
                            possible and to take advantage of every favorable opportunity to bring
                            home to the Japanese Government this Government’s principles of policy
                            and broad objectives in the Far East. I question, however, whether the
                            Department will wish to issue instructions or to comment in regard to
                            the Japanese reply to our note of October 6 or in regard to the
                            conversations with the Foreign Minister before it has had time
                            thoroughly to study the Japanese reply and the statements which the
                            Foreign Minister may make to Dooman and to you. It seems probable,
                            therefore, that in your conversation with Arita, unless there should
                            develop before that conversation some urgent question which demands
                            immediate action, the Department will want to rely upon your sound
                            discretion exercised against the background of this Government’s policy
                            as indicated in the Department’s 212, June 25, 4 p.m.,<note n="29"
                                xml:id="d113fn29"><ref target="frus1938v03#pg_203">Vol. <hi

                            October 1, 2 p.m., and other instructions sent you from time to time. In
                            this connection, if your conversation occurs on Monday as scheduled and
                            if the Japanese reply to our note of October 6 is made before that time,
                            you may wish to indicate to Arita that the short time that has elapsed
                            since the receipt of the Japanese reply renders desirable a continuation
                            of your conversation with him at some early future date.</p>
                        <p>The Department feels that it might be well for you on any and all
                            occasions when and as opportunity presents and when the Open Door
                            policy, the Nine Power Treaty and such matters come within the field of
                            discussion, to emphasize to high Japanese officials the fact that the
                            principle of equality of commercial opportunity has been a fundamental
                            principle of the foreign policy of the United States ever since this
                            country came into existence; that treaties relating to the Far East to
                            which this country is a party and in which provisions relating to that
                            principle appear were in all instances concluded with a view to
                            decreasing and avoiding frictions which had developed or which might
                            develop in international contacts in the region or regions under
                            reference; that the American Government and people believe with
                            conviction that the principles and the provisions are sound, in the
                            interests of all concerned; and that adherence to, respect for and
                            observance of those principles and provisions will make for peace and
                            general prosperity whereas contrary courses would inevitably make for
                            friction and consequences injurious to all countries including those
                            which pursue such courses.</p>

                        <p>186. My 184, November 16, 4 p.m.<note n="30" xml:id="d114fn30">Not
                                printed.</note> The American representative of an American oil firm
                            and responsible Chinese businessmen here state that considerable
                            quantities of commercial freight, principally Japanese, are arriving
                            here from Shanghai by Chinese merchant vessels and Japanese lighters.
                            These men have not kept detailed records of import and export cargoes
                            (as have been done by the British shipping agents mentioned in my 158,

                            November 16, 4 p.m.) but they have given careful study to shipping and
                            they believe that commercial shipments make up an average of between 30
                            and 40% of the cargoes carried by Japanese commercial vessels and
                            lighters arriving here from Shanghai. They add that on down river trips
                            the cargoes of these vessels consist almost entirely of commercial
                            exports from this area.</p>
                        <p>In this connection it should be mentioned that on July 31 there were 1514
                            Japanese civilians and 172 Japanese shops in Nanking. A few days ago the
                            Japanese Consul General informed me that there were now approximately
                            3000 Japanese civilians in Nanking, or double the number 3 months ago.
                            The number of Japanese shops has also greatly increased. The Japanese
                            Consul General said that most of these Japanese civilians were small
                            shopkeepers and it would seem, from observation, that they deal chiefly
                            in Japanese imported goods. Until the end of September, when the
                            Shanghai-Nanking railroad freight service was established, the Japanese
                            goods sold in these shops were brought here by Japanese vessels; with
                            the advent of the railroad freight service a fairly large amount began
                            to be transported by this means, but the railroad cannot handle the
                            increasing imports (and other freight) and a considerable amount is
                            still brought here by Japanese merchant vessels.</p>
                        <p>In general, foreign goods can only be shipped and sold here through
                            Japanese agents. The trade in petroleum products in the Nanking area,
                            now only about 15% of normal, is handled chiefly through Japanese firms;
                            one British and one American oil firm handle foreigners’ business almost
                            entirely through Japanese agents; one American firm markets about 85% of
                            its products through Japanese agents here, but is endeavoring to market
                            the balance through its own organization, although all shipments from
                            Shanghai to Nanking are <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0096"/>handled
                            through Japanese transportation firms. This company, however, fears that
                            it is only a question of time until its Japanese agents will take over
                            all marketing here. The trade in cigarettes and other foreign goods is
                            almost entirely in the hands of Japanese firms, who handle shipments
                            from Shanghai and marketing here; many American and other foreign goods,
                            however, are being displaced by Japanese goods, this being particularly
                            noticeable in the case of canned goods.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese attitude in regard to American and other foreign business in
                            Japanese-occupied areas in China is well expressed in the following
                            remark made some time ago by a Japanese businessman to an American
                            fellow traveller on a train coming to Nanking: “Of course, you Americans
                            are not allowed to do business in occupied territory but you can do it
                            through a Japanese.” It becomes increasingly clear that the Japanese
                            intend to control foreign trade in this area and to place every obstacle
                            in the way of business by non-Japanese foreigners.</p>
                        <p>In view of the continued and serious Japanese interference with American
                            rights and interests in this area, I cannot but be struck with the
                            evidence in Nanking of substantial American contributions to the
                            Japanese military organization, the actions of which have created the
                            conditions against which we protest. The Japanese Army motorized
                            equipment, in particular, appears to be largely American; the main
                            streets of Nanking are full of Japanese Army motor cars, motor trucks,
                            and tractors, and, from the observations of members of the staff of this
                            office, at least 70 or 80% of these bear the names of American
                            manufacturers. The American Douglas airplane in Japanese military
                            service is a frequent sight over Nanking; yesterday, while driving past
                            the inner city airfield, I noticed, among others, six planes, apparently
                            Douglas transports. The representative of an American oil firm here
                            informs me that a large part, if not most, of the gasoline used by the
                            Japanese bombing and other planes based on Nanking is of American
                            origin, and that a substantial part of the fuel used by Japanese naval
                            vessels on the river is also of American origin. There are, of course,
                            other American contributions to the Japanese military organization,
                            which need not be listed here.</p>

                        <p>15. 1. The chief of the Japanese special naval mission which office has
                            controlled the shipments in and out of Tsingtao and which is responsible
                                <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0097"/>for the complaints of local
                            American firms is being recalled. There is some reason to believe that
                            his recall is directly connected with the protests of the foreign
                            governments and it has been reported that the Tokyo authorities have
                            given orders that within a period of 2 months the port of Tsingtao must
                            be made completely open to foreign trade without the restrictions which
                            the Japanese have imposed in recent months.</p>
                        <p>2. The signs of a relaxation are believed to be also due to complaints by
                            Japanese merchants that the naval mission’s restrictions had caused
                            Shantung export produce to flow toward Tientsin and not to Tsingtao.</p>
                        <p>3. It is somewhat early to state definitely that interference with our
                            trade will cease immediately with the recall of the chief of the mission
                            but there are signs that our Government’s protest has made a deep
                            impression in Japanese quarters.</p>

                        <p>744. Our 732, November 16, 3 p.m. The following is a summary of the
                            private and informal interview lasting over an hour which Dooman had
                            this afternoon with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. As preamble I
                            quote the first two paragraphs of Dooman’s memorandum of the
                                conversation.<note n="32" xml:id="d116fn32"><ref

                                outset how the Ambassador had reacted to the note which was handed
                                to me last evening at the Foreign Office.<note n="33"
                                    xml:id="d116fn33"><ref target="frus1931-41v01#pg_797"><hi

                                that the Ambassador had examined the note with the best of good will
                                but that he was unable to find in it any statement which was
                                substantially responsive to the desires of the American Government.
                                Mr. Arita said, ‘Well, I suppose not.</item>

                            <item>Mr. Arita remarked that we were meeting, of course, informally and
                                as old friends and that he felt that he could express himself freely
                                to me not only because he could use the medium of his own language
                                but he need not be unduly reserved.”</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Arita said that he realized that the reply of the Japanese
                                Government to our note of October 6 did not refer at length to the
                                question of Japanese observance of the principle of equality of
                                opportunity. He was obliged to consider Japanese public opinion and
                                if he had <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0098"/>presented in that
                                reply the only position which public opinion in this country would
                                approve or tolerate he would merely have given impetus to a debate
                                which while exacerbating feeling displayed in the United States
                                would have led to no constructive conclusion. On the other hand
                                there was much he wished he could have included in that note and
                                that he proposed to lay before me during our interview on Monday. He
                                had asked Dooman to come in today in order that the latter could
                                report to me beforehand what Arita has in mind.</item>

                            <item>There were two points which Arita believed merited the
                                understanding of the American Government and people.</item>

                            <item>The first of these is that China is the only area in which the
                                principle of equality of opportunity was set up by international
                                agreement. It is true that a similar arrangement obtains with regard
                                to Congo Basin.<note n="34" xml:id="d116fn34">See art. 1, convention

                                        p. 437</ref>.</note> After an extended account of the
                                development of the Open Door in China, he said that the Japanese
                                people felt that the motive of the European powers in emphasizing
                                the Open Door in China is to assure opportunity for their
                                exploitation of China just as they are now exploiting Africa.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>The second point is that the United States and British Empire are
                                self-contained economic as well as political entities. They have
                                great wealth, they possess most of the necessary raw materials, and
                                each contains within itself a large domestic market. Each country
                                can, therefore, regard with composure any attempt at coercion by
                                other powers through economic or for that matter military sanctions.
                                Japan is, however, in a different position. Its domestic market is
                                small and it possesses few resources. An army and a navy are
                                incapable of securing the national defenses if attack is made, not
                                by military instruments, but by the withholding from Japan of
                                foreign markets and of essential raw materials. It is now the
                                intention of Japan to place itself in a position of security against
                                the possible application of sanctions either by the League of
                                Nations or “by nations inside and outside the League.”</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>It was, therefore, impossible for Japan now to give an unqualified
                                undertaking to respect the Open Door. True, Arita’s predecessors had
                                given such assurances, but they had made, in his opinion, the
                                mistake of trying to reconcile the Open Door with the accomplishment
                                of Japan’s objectives as above explained, and this could not
                                successfully be done. He intended to approach the problem from a
                                different direction. He would say plainly that Japan proposes to
                                secure in China a safe market and a safe source of raw materials,
                                but he would also say categorically that foreign enterprises and
                                undertakings which did not conflict with the accomplishment of those
                                objectives <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0099"/>would be respected
                                and indeed would be encouraged. He strongly objected to the use of
                                the word “bloc” in connection with the system of economic
                                cooperation which would be set up by China, Japan, and Manchukuo: he
                                would declare that Japan contemplates no territorial acquisition at
                                the expense of the other two countries quite as positively as that
                                she is determined to round out her plans for “economic national
                                defense.”</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>Arita’s final statement was a plea for continued oral and informal
                                discussion between himself and me which he believed would be more
                                likely to lead to agreeing on a new definition of the Open Door
                                acceptable to both Governments than by recourse to discussion in
                                official notes.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>Dooman confined his remarks largely to emphasizing the discrepancy
                                between even the new Japanese concept of the Open Door as just
                                propounded by Mr. Arita and actual developments in China. If there
                                are no objections I would make wholly clear the views of our
                                Government during the course of our forthcoming interview.<note

                        <p>393. Your 711, November 7, 8 p.m., and previous, in regard to equality of
                            opportunity. With regard to the general question of the principle of
                            equality in the Far East, the Department suggests that, if and as
                            opportune occasions arise, the Embassy in its discretion point out to
                            Japanese officials that this Government is anxious to contribute toward
                            improvement of international relations and restoration of international
                            order, thereby arresting the present trend toward international anarchy;
                            that this Government advocates faithful observance of international
                            agreements and adjustment of problems in international relations by
                            processes of peaceful negotiation and agreement; that this Government,
                            in the belief that a normal expansion of foreign commerce will improve
                            world economic conditions, raise and enrich living standards, and
                            promote better and more harmonious relations among nations, has pursued
                            a trade policy the object of which has been and is to induce all
                            countries to remove or lower restrictions upon the exchanging of goods
                            in international trade; that the people of this country believe in and
                            the American Government has always <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0100"
                            />been guided by the principle of equality of commercial opportunity;
                            that in our opinion an endeavor by any country in any part of the world
                            to establish in favor of itself a preferred position in another country
                            is incompatible with the maintenance of our own and the establishment of
                            world prosperity; that we feel that no one government can with warrant
                            expect to make its will and desires exclusive and conclusive throughout
                            an important and extensive area of the world; and that we believe that
                            an endeavor on the part of any government to do that, irrespective of
                            the motive, is bound to be injurious not only to other countries but in
                            the long run to its own country and itself.</p>

                            of course, it would be apparent to the correspondents that the Japanese
                            reply is not responsive to the position of this Government as set forth
                            in our note of October 6 and to the general position which this country
                            has consistently taken, throughout our history, with regard to American
                            rights and interests not only in relations with China but in relations
                            with all countries. Beyond this, the Secretary said, he preferred not to
                            comment until the Department should have had more time to study the
                            substance and implications of the Japanese note.</p>

                        <p>23. Universal Leaf Tobacco Company case. After receiving some
                            encouragement from Japanese Embassy officials in Peiping who indicated
                            that the company could operate in Shantung tobacco market if it
                            purchased $200,000 Federal Reserve currency at the official rate of
                            exchange, the company has been informed by the local Japanese Consulate
                            General that such a small figure is not acceptable here and that
                            $1,500,000 should be acquired by the company at official rate of
                            exchange. The company naturally refused to consider such an amount and
                            has suspended negotiations. At present the firm can neither purchase
                            tobacco nor can it ship its stocks from Tsingtao but confidentially it
                            prefers for the time being to let the whole matter rest.</p>

                        <p>24. 1. The Consulate is transmitting another statement from the American
                            Chamber of Commerce in Tsingtao dealing with American interests and
                            Japanese restrictions. After expressing appreciation for note of October
                            6 and the note in regard to the opening of the Yangtze, it requests that
                            further representations be made to the Japanese Government in connection
                            with “the restrictions, discriminations and interference” by Japanese
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>2. The statement points out that situation in respect to export trade
                            remains unchanged for Americans while Japanese exporters are able to
                            transact business with world markets at prices which necessarily must be
                            based on counter rate of exchange and not on official rate of exchange.
                            The difficulties of Universal Leaf Tobacco Company are also referred
                            to.</p>
                        <p>3. The next section deals with the continued denial of use of wharves to
                            ships other than those under Japanese registry.</p>
                        <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0102"/>
                        <p>4. The restrictions on shipment of produce from Tsingtao to other Chinese
                            ports are dealt with. Permission to ship bristles is being refused
                            altogether, while other commodities may be shipped if documents are
                            handled by Japanese banks at official rate of exchange.</p>
                        <p>5. Attention is then drawn to difficulties of a local dairy in obtaining
                            forage for the milk cows due to interference by Japanese military who
                            require much feed for their horses.</p>
                        <p>6. In conclusion, the Chamber repeats the suggested American official
                            action referred to in my telegram No. 1 of October 24, 3 p.m., third
                            paragraph, and points out that Japanese firms continue to export staple
                            products while Americans and other parties cannot make shipments.</p>

                            British colleague has just furnished me with a copy of a memorandum of
                            his conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on November 24.
                            The following is a summary: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>With reference to the Japanese intention to set up a new order
                                    in China, Craigie gave Arita a memorandum designed to refute the
                                    suggestion implied in Arita’s previous remarks that the British
                                    Empire could be regarded as an economic bloc in which Japan
                                    suffered trade discrimination. The memorandum contained figures
                                    demonstrating that the British Empire has been a vital factor in
                                    Japan’s economic and commercial expansion.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Arita denied that Japan’s objective was to close China to
                                    exports, but he emphasized Japan’s intention to secure equal
                                    rights in the development [of] China’s natural resources and to
                                    have raw materials available in territory from which she could
                                    not be cut off by belligerent action of third powers. Craigie
                                    asked if he could understand that the Japanese would refrain
                                    from discriminatory treatment of foreign trade by resort to such
                                    measures as differential tariffs, exchange control or barter
                                    arrangements, but Arita said that he hoped to reply to that
                                    question in the near future.</item>

                                Commercial Secretary in Japan.</note> with regard to the currency
                            situation in North China and, as suggested in your letter of December
                                1,<note n="36d" xml:id="d123fn36d">Not printed.</note> to the
                            possibility of finding “any further method which may not yet have been
                            tried for resisting” the currency and other measures which the Japanese
                            are using to the detriment of foreign interests. I enclose a copy of a
                            memorandum on this subject which Mr. Williams has now presented to
                            me.</p>
                        <p>The facts are quite clear. These measures which are being taken in North
                            China do not issue from a group of irresponsible Japanese officials in
                            North China but are being promulgated with the cognizance and the
                            approval of the Japanese Government. They are one of the means by which
                            the so-called Continental Policy is being implemented, and for that
                            reason I have not been too hopeful that the numerous representations
                            which we have both made to the Japanese Government on this matter will
                            lead to a substantial modification of the situation.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the question whether some way can be found to resist these
                            measures, my views are substantially those outlined by Mr. Williams in
                            paragraph numbered 7 of his memorandum. In my opinion, these problems of
                            currency and of exchange are matters of general, and not specific,
                            policy and they need to be “considered and dealt with inseparably from
                            the entire Far Eastern question”. It is possible that there may be
                            available some way of purely local application by which the Japanese
                            measures may be partially circumvented and the conditions in North China
                            thus alleviated to some extent, but I believe that you will agree with
                            me that our respective colleagues in China would be in a better position
                            than we could be to determine whether anything practicable along those
                            lines might be accomplished. You and I have discussed frankly the
                            possibility of resort to more far-reaching measures in order to resist
                            the further unfolding of Japan’s ambitions in China, and I confirm the
                            conclusion which I expressed to you orally during our conversation on
                            December 5th, that, as I do not believe that anything short of force can
                                <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0104"/>lead to substantial
                            moderation of Japanese policy in China, I cannot conscientiously
                            recommend to my Government recourse to economic sanctions.</p>

                            <p>With reference to the letter addressed to you under date of December
                                1, 1938, by His Excellency, the British Ambassador,<note n="36e"
                                    xml:id="d123fn36e">Not printed.</note> concerning the gradually
                                increasing pressure being exercised by the Japanese authorities in
                                North China to the detriment of foreign interests, I have the
                                following comments to make on the currency and exchange situation in
                                so far as it affects American interests.</p>
                            <p>1) You will remember that Japan’s reply to our Note of October 6th
                                evades the control of foreign trade and foreign exchange transaction
                                issues as raised in our Note, but deals chiefly with the necessity
                                of establishing the Federal Reserve Bank notes as the compulsory
                                currency in North China and the elimination of the “fapi” or Chinese
                                notes as currency.</p>
                            <p>2) As a forward step towards accomplishing this, the Japanese have, I
                                am informed on good authority, been exchanging the FRB notes in
                                North China for “fapi” and using the latter in the Shanghai market
                                to purchase foreign exchange under the limited weekly allotment
                                allowed by the Chinese authorities for legitimate commercial
                                purposes—this allowance being extended even to Japanese. The
                                pressure so exerted on the Chinese currency has been largely
                                responsible for its drop of 40% in terms of Sterling and the United
                                States Dollar (from 1/2½d. and 29½¢ to 8d. and 16¢).</p>
                            <p>3) Traders in China, including Chinese and Japanese, have no
                                confidence in the FRB notes as these have no gold reserves or
                                foreign currency backing except certain arrangements with Japanese
                                banks.</p>
                            <p>4) The prevailing low exchange value of “fapi” has increased the cost
                                of foreign imports other than Japanese into China by approximately
                                40%, but the use of FRB notes at par with “fapi” or even at the
                                present 10% discount in North China enables importers to obtain
                                Japanese goods in that area for practically the same price as paid
                                before the China hostilities began. In other words, the market in
                                North China is at present, to all intents and purposes, the same as
                                the domestic market in Japan and is destined to become even more so
                                as time goes <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0105"/>on unless, of
                                course, something is done to stop these inequitable practices.
                                Furthermore, unless the FRB notes have a foreign exchange value and
                                the Japanese allow foreign exchange coverage to American traders,
                                our foreign import business will eventually be cut to a very small
                                figure or cease altogether.</p>
                            <p>As an indication of the extent to which Japan’s trade is profiting in
                                North China from virtually exclusive or preferential transportation
                                rights and facilities and a 40% price differential, Japan has
                                exported to that area during the first ten months of 1938 Yen
                                156,654,000 worth of goods against Yen 64,521,000 for the
                                corresponding period of 1937 and Yen 46,228,000 for the same period
                                in 1936. These figures represent an increase of 142.8% over 1937
                                business and 238.9% over 1936.</p>
                            <p>5) Prices of North China export commodities to foreign buyers have
                                risen commensurate with the fall of the “fapi”, but the Japanese
                                control prices and use FRB notes to pay for such goods on the basis
                                of Yen 1.00 for one FRB Yuan. No foreign exchange is involved. On
                                the other hand, foreign exporters must supply foreign exchange at
                                open market or arbitrary rates, thus making their prices
                                prohibitive. In addition these foreign merchants must pay open
                                market exchange rates on imports which likewise results in
                                prohibitive prices in competition with the Japanese.</p>
                            <p>From these few facts it is quite discernible that the Japanese are
                                gradually but surely closing the open door.</p>
                            <p>6) It is quite likely that the Japanese military authorities will
                                enforce acceptance of the FRB notes in North China by March 10,
                                1939, but if this is done it can be assumed from the statements made
                                in the second and third sentences of the fifth paragraph of the
                                Japanese Government’s reply to our Note of October 6th that the
                                Japanese Government is not only countenancing but most probably
                                initiating such a step. (As a matter of possible interest to you, in
                                the discussions of the question of Nationalist currency in China by
                                the tripartite conference composed of representatives of Japan,
                                “Manchoukuo” and China last week in Osaka, the spokesman of the
                                Peking regime reportedly counseled against taking any strong
                                measures to eliminate it from circulation as he stated that it has
                                much to do with the welfare of the people in general. Apparently
                                this attitude reflects that of the people of North China.)</p>
                            <p>7) As to what methods should be used for resisting this and other
                                measures mentioned by the British Ambassador, it seems to me that
                                this must be considered and dealt with inseparably from the entire
                                Far Eastern question. The matter of exchange, currency and trade
                                control is merely a branch of the now, let us say, half grown tree
                                “Changed Conditions in Asia,” whose roots run deep into the Asiatic
                                continent. If any pruning is to be successfully accomplished the
                                roots must first <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0106"/>be
                                properly treated. My personal opinion is that only measures
                                envisaging extremely drastic steps backed by the determination to
                                resort to military and naval force, if necessary, will cause Japan
                                to deviate from her determination to exercise full and complete
                                economic control of China.</p>

                        <p>228. Late this evening I received communication from Japanese Consulate

                                    the Japanese military authorities have decided to commence as
                                    from the 14th December the investigation of Chinese who may pass
                                    through the barriers placed on Yamaguchi Road, Asahi Road, Fuyo
                                    Road, and the north side of the International Bridge. Foreigners

                        <p>110. Your 228, December 13, 8 p.m. For your guidance in giving further
                            consideration to this matter, the Department offers comment as follows:
                            Inasmuch as (1) Japanese military control of all areas of the city other
                            than the British, French and Italian Concessions is a fact which cannot
                            be ignored; (2) facilitation of the movements of American nationals is a
                            primary consideration to be taken into account; and (3) production of
                            passports or identifying documents is a procedure with which American
                            nationals can with reasonable ease comply, it is suggested that American
                            nationals might find it advisable and convenient, as a matter of
                            expediency, voluntarily to comply with the advice of the Japanese
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>A procedure somewhat similar in character to that described in your
                            telegram has been instituted by the Japanese authorities in Shanghai and
                            Hankow and American nationals in those cities are endeavoring to conform
                            thereto.</p>
                        <p>Please send copies of your telegram under reference and this telegram to
                            Peiping and ask Peiping to send you a copy, for information and
                            guidance, of the Department’s 11, November 8, 6 p.m., to Hankow.<note

                        <p>76. 1. The Department has practically completed its study of the Japanese
                            Government’s reply of November 18 to this Government’s note of October 6
                            on the subject of American rights and interests in China and has
                            prepared a draft rejoinder which is summarized below in paragraph
                            numbered 2.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>2. The Government of the United States reaffirms its opinion that
                                imposition of restrictions upon activities of American nationals
                                engaged in educational, philanthropic and commercial endeavors is
                                unquestionably discriminatory against legitimate American interests.
                                Further, the plans and practices of the Japanese authorities in
                                regard to exchange control, compulsory currency circulation, tariff
                                revision, and monopolistic promotion imply that the Japanese
                                Government or Japanese-controlled regimes are entitled as by right
                                of sovereignty to disregard the established rights and interests of
                                other countries, including the United States. The Government of the
                                United States is convinced that the restrictions and measures under
                                reference are unjust, unwarranted and counter to treaty provisions
                                binding on both Japan and the United States.</p>
                            <p>The American Government in its note of October 6 requested that the
                                Japanese Government carry out its reiterated assurances to observe
                                the principle of equality of opportunity and abide by its treaty
                                obligations. <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0109"/>In its reply
                                the Japanese Government apparently regards observance of that
                                principle as conditioned by a “new order” and a “new situation” in
                                the Far East.</p>
                            <p>This country’s adherence to and advocacy of the principle of equality
                                of opportunity does not result solely from a desire to obtain
                                commercial benefits but primarily from a conviction that observance
                                leads to economic and political stability and promotes the opening
                                of trade channels with mutually and reciprocally beneficial
                                results.</p>
                            <p>The American people and their Government could not assent to the
                                establishment, at the instance of and for the special purpose of any
                                third country, of a regime which would arbitrarily deprive them of
                                rights which are legally and justly theirs.</p>
                            <p>The American Government cannot accept the implication that enjoyment
                                of equality of opportunity is to be contingent upon its admission of
                                the validity of the conception of Japanese authorities of a “new
                                order” and a “new situation” in East Asia.</p>
                            <p>Fundamental principles such as that of equality of opportunity are
                                not subject to modification by a unilateral dictum.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese Government has in various international agreements and
                                understandings committed itself to the observance of the principle
                                of equality of economic opportunity and has frequently insisted upon
                                its observance by other nations.</p>
                            <p>The position of the American Government on the subject of revision of
                                agreements is recalled to the Japanese Government by the quoting of
                                two passages from this Government’s note to Japan of April 29,

                            <p>The American Government has always regarded agreements as susceptible
                                of amendment but has always insisted that only by orderly processes
                                among the parties thereto can changes rightfully and lawfully be
                                made, views to which the Japanese Government has upon numerous
                                occasions subscribed.</p>
                            <p>The Government and people of the United States cannot assent to the
                                termination of the provisions of treaties to which this Government
                                is party or of rights and obligations thereunder by the arbitrary
                                action of any other country.</p>
                            <p>The American Government is now, as always, prepared to consider any
                                just and reasonable proposals envisaging the resolving of problems
                                in a manner fair to all directly concerned by processes of free
                                negotiation and new commitment. The Japanese Government has had and
                                continues to have opportunity to make such proposals, which this
                                Government has been and continues to be willing to discuss, if and
                                when put forward, at whatever time and in whatever place may be
                                agreed upon, with representatives of the other powers, including
                                Japan and China, whose rights and interests are involved.</p>

                            the substance of the draft. Since its note of November 18, the Japanese
                            Government has proceeded steadily with its plans for <pb n="106"
                                xml:id="pg_106" facs="0110"/>economic control in China and has shown
                            no moderation of its attitude toward American rights and interests in
                            China, which continue to be impaired. The Japanese Foreign Minister has
                            suggested to Ambassador Grew that further exchanges of views between our
                            two governments be oral. However, the Japanese Government, after each
                            conversation between the Foreign Minister and Grew on the general
                            subject of American rights and interests in China, has inspired
                            statements in the Japanese press in outline and support of the Japanese
                            Government’s views in regard to the proposed “new order” in East Asia.
                            On December 19 the Japanese Foreign Minister issued to the press a
                            formal statement expository of the Japanese Government’s views.<note

                            statements have appeared in a number of the leading papers in this
                            country, and so far this Government has taken no action to refute them.
                            We therefore feel that the sending of this rejoinder to the Japanese
                            Government would serve a very useful purpose in clarifying our position
                            both to our own people and to the Japanese Government. We incline to the
                            view that it would be well to present the rejoinder to the Japanese
                            Government at an opportune moment, perhaps within the next 10 days. I
                            should greatly appreciate your comments and suggestions.<note n="44"

                            of the position taken by Arita in his talks with Dooman and with me as
                            reported in the Embassy’s despatch 3455, November 25<note n="45"

                            talks with Craigie as reported in various of our telegrams, with some
                            refinements of phraseology, worth noting. [Here follows a report on the
                            statement.]</p>
                        <p>2. The Foreign Minister’s statement is of very little value in
                            forecasting the specific decisions which must affect particular rights
                            and interests in China. It is our opinion that the confining of the
                            statement <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0111"/>to generalities and
                            the scrupulous avoidance of commitment on specific foreign rights and
                            interests in China, which might be regarded as falling outside the
                            Japanese economic defense program, is a matter of deliberate policy, a
                            primary motive of which is to keep a free hand for any subsequent
                            discussions or negotiations which may occur. Even if the contemplated
                            system of control is envisaged in some detail the Japanese Government
                            would obviously be in a stronger negotiating position later if such
                            decisions were not already divulged.</p>
                        <p>3. The statement’s careful avoidance of the formulas which have
                            previously defined principles applicable to the relations of foreign
                            countries with China undoubtedly reflects a calculated determination on
                            the part of the Japanese. The statement is in no respect substantially
                            new. It represents a trial, on the press, of ideas which the Japanese
                            Government has already presented in only slightly different forms.</p>

                            with regard to the recent credit to China was characterized in telegram

                                    spokesman when interviewed this afternoon.</p>
                                <p>The changed circumstances referred to by Mr. Arita, continued the
                                    spokesman, were brought about by Japan’s forcible encroachments
                                    upon China’s integrity in recent years and by her closing of the
                                    Open Door in certain areas of China.</p>
                                <p>These were exactly circumstances which the Nine Power Treaty was
                                    designed to prevent but which had been brought about by Japan in
                                    violation of the treaty, said the spokesman, adding that a
                                    treaty could not be considered inapplicable simply because of
                                    violations by one of its signatories.</p>
                                <p>Commenting on Japan’s objection to the British and American loans
                                    to China, the spokesman said Japan had no ground for raising any
                                    objection in this matter.</p>
                                <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0112"/>
                                <p>Even if the American and British loans were intended as political
                                    gestures against Japan, as Mr. Arita thought they were, such
                                    gestures were justified and represented the minimum of action
                                    open to the powers, said the spokesman after referring to
                                    Japan’s ‘treaty-breaking activities and destruction of foreign
                                    rights and interests in China’.</p>
                                <p>Commenting on Mr. Arita’s avowed solicitude for the welfare of
                                    third-party nationals in China, the spokesman said the
                                    ‘embarrassments and inconveniences’ caused to them by the
                                    hostilities were directly attributable to Japan’s aggression in
                                    China. Consequently, if Mr. Arita were really sincere in his
                                    professed anxiety to third-party nationals regarding
                                    ‘embarrassments and inconveniences’, he should move to stop his
                                    country’s aggression.</p>
                                <p>Concerning the third point made by Mr. Arita that the
                                    establishment by so-called economic bloc between Japan, China
                                    and ‘Manchukuo’ would not hamper foreign interests in China, the
                                    spokesman contended that this was disproved by the whole train
                                    of events since 1931.</p>
                                <p>Inasmuch as the Japanese proposal of such a tripartite bloc of
                                    ‘new order’ in eastern Asia was aimed at the establishment of
                                    Japan’s hegemony in eastern Asia, said the spokesman, it was in
                                    direct conflict with foreign rights and interests in eastern
                                    Asia.”</p>

                                <p>“December 22, 4 p.m. Embassy’s December 17, 1 p.m. I am still
                                    unable to ascertain precisely what restrictions on the movements
                                    of Americans and American cargo are enforced by the Japanese
                                    military at the present time, although I have questioned Consul
                                    General Tashiro yesterday following his return from Japan, and
                                    in his absence Consul Tanaka, and have written to Consul General
                                    Tashiro asking for information as to the precise nature and
                                    purpose of these restrictions, his written reply having stated
                                    merely that the measures taken ‘have not been adopted to
                                    restrict the movements of American citizens but only to inspect
                                    those Chinese who pass these barriers in an effort to curb the
                                    activities of anti-Japanese and communistic elements. Orders
                                    have been given to hinder the movements of citizens and subjects
                                    of other countries as little as possible, but to our great
                                    regret it is inevitable that such citizens and subjects
                                    sometimes experience inconveniences and delay when passing
                                    points where inspection of Chinese is being carried on.’</p>

                                <p>It is impossible to predict with any certainty what would be
                                    involved in ‘isolation’ of the American industries but it might
                                    be of interest in this connection to know that Consul General
                                    Tashiro voluntarily called on me yesterday to discuss the
                                    inconveniences being suffered by Americans, for which he
                                    expressed regret and which he is evidently disposed to remedy so
                                    far as lies within his power, and that the Japanese military
                                    complied with our request that the barrier at the race course
                                    road corner of the marine barracks be removed into the first
                                    Special Area beyond the barracks gate, leaving the barracks
                                    unobstructed entrances both from the British Concession and
                                    first Special Area.</p>
                                <p>The third section of this telegram has been drafted on the
                                    assumption that in case of ‘isolation’ of the American
                                    industries American nationals could pass the barriers both in
                                    and out, and that foodstuffs could come in; but that Chinese and
                                    commercial cargo could not pass in or out, that the customshouse
                                    would be moved outside the Concessions, and that there would be
                                    exchange control.</p>
                                <p>The nature and extent of American interests in the British and
                                    French Concessions at Tientsin are (1) an American investment
                                    estimated at more than $12,000,000 local currency including
                                    land, buildings, machinery and equipment, stocks of merchandise,
                                    unregistered loans and mortgages; (2) the business turnover of
                                    American firms in the concessions covers, roughly estimated
                                    $200,000,000 local currency, about half of which is business
                                    conducted by the two American banks; (3) trade with the United
                                    States handled by non-American firms (little of which is done by
                                    Japanese firms) conservatively estimated at $50,000,000 local
                                    currency in the current year.</p>
                                <p>The American interests in the British and French Concessions
                                    include: 2 banks, 2 petroleum companies, 2 dye houses, 4 motor
                                    dealers, 2 woolen mills, more than 20 fur exporters, and several
                                    general import-export firms, real estate companies and other
                                    enterprises. American citizens reside in these two
                                    Concessions.</p>
                                <p>All important American business firms in Tientsin, in reply to
                                    inquiries made by this Consulate General, have expressed the
                                    opinion that isolation of the Concessions by the Japanese would
                                    stop all American business at least temporarily or permanently
                                    as it would be very difficult if not impossible to conduct
                                    business activities outside the Concessions and certainly
                                    impossible to continue business activities from within the
                                    Concessions as the firms would be unable to maintain their
                                    contacts with Chinese customers and also would not be able
                                    either to receive or deliver cargo. The Consulate General
                                    concurs in these views.</p>
                                <p>The effect of the steps already taken by the Japanese is reported
                                    by Americans as being not extremely grave. Some difficulties are
                                    reported in connection with passing cargo out of or into the
                                    Concessions to or from Japanese-controlled areas resulting in
                                    delays and increased expense; a certain amount of difficulty and
                                    delay was reported in connection with Chinese office employees
                                    and laborers who live outside the Concession reaching American
                                    offices and shops in the Concession; and a diminution of all
                                    business is reported due to the prevailing uncertainty as to the
                                    immediate intentions of the Japanese military.</p>
                                <p>The above refers only to the British and French Concessions, but
                                    it should be borne in mind that the installations of the
                                    Standard and Texas Oil Companies and other American properties

                        <p>It is difficult to draw the dividing line between bona fide restrictions
                            to curb aid to guerrillas and the imposition of restrictions designed to
                            prevent normal trade activity. There are so many outward signs, however,
                            studied plan intended gradually to stifle the business activities of
                            third powers protected in China that there seems little likelihood that
                            the Tientsin restrictions will be removed in the immediate future or
                            even to any appreciable extent. Certainly this has not been done in
                            Shanghai. But the restrictions from which businessmen in Tientsin will
                            suffer most in the aggregate will not be those now being imposed and
                            against which complaint is made. They as well as American businessmen in
                            other parts of China will suffer more from embargoes of various kinds,
                            both import and export, stringent exchange regulations, discriminatory
                            practices, transportation and other monopolies and in general the
                            conduct of competitive business with a low overhead and through Chinese
                            connections. The German businessman will suffer along with the
                            individual American and British businessman and this condition may
                            obtain for some time. There are some however who hold that in the
                            ultimate American trade as a whole may not suffer as much as the present
                            trend might lead one to believe but this is debatable and only the
                            passage of time will reveal whether the theory is sound. It might well
                            prove to be true in certain lines of trade such as automobiles,
                            airplanes and certain kinds of railway equipment. The coming year should
                            definitely determine whether American trade will be able to survive in
                            Tientsin and other parts of China.</p>

                            telegram 794, December 20, 7 p.m.). It is mainly a summation, for the
                            press, of views already made known to us through conversations with the
                            Foreign Minister and through other channels. The statement should be
                            regarded as one more step by Japan in the effort, still in flux, to
                            project general convictions of policy gradually forward toward questions
                            of their application; and, viewed in terms of practical application, the
                            statement is not very helpful as indication of treatment to be expected
                            by American interests in China.</p>
                        <p>The self-sufficient-economic-unit argument is put forward in defense of a
                            tripartite unitary relationship between Japan, “Manchukuo,” and China;
                            but the assertion is made (as in Mr. Arita’s conversations with the
                            British Ambassador) that “the proposed unit in East Asia is by no means
                            to be a system of closed trade.” Adherence by Japan in the past to the
                            principle of equality of commercial opportunity is affirmed, and it is
                            stated that Japan still “upholds the freedom of economic activity in all
                            parts of the world as a matter of principle.” Reference is made to a
                            necessity for the imposing upon the economic activities of other powers
                            of “restrictions dictated by the requirements of the national defense
                            and economic security of the countries grouped under the new order.” The
                            conviction is expressed that the new order “would by no means entail any
                            diminution of the trade between that group and other countries.” (This
                            last statement should be carefully noted. The release includes no
                            assertion that foreign trade in China itself is expected to maintain its
                            past volume; reference is only to the total of trade with the
                            group.)</p>
                        <p>Remarks made by Mr. Arita to the foreign correspondents in response to
                            questions posed by them at the press conference of December 19 are of
                            interest, though lacking the authority of the prepared written release.
                            The second enclosure herewith<note n="51a" xml:id="d133fn51a">Not
                                printed.</note> embodies a newspaper report of the questions and
                            answers. Invited to indicate what kinds of foreign economic activity in
                            China might be considered subject to restrictions dictated by the
                            requirements of national defense and economic security, the Foreign
                            Minister was elusive. On the subject of inapplicability of certain
                            provisions of the nine power pact he added nothing new but admitted that
                            some provisions of the treaty of Portsmouth<note n="52"

                            similarly be inapplicable under present conditions. <pb n="112"
                                xml:id="pg_112" facs="0116"/>The Foreign Minister declined to engage
                            in a discussion as to whether other countries are at liberty to denounce
                            certain articles in their commercial treaties with Japan. To the next
                            questions he gave it as his opinion that extraterritoriality will
                            gradually be abolished, that abolition of foreign concessions will
                            depend on developments, that all restrictions to which modern states are
                            not subjected will gradually be abolished. Replying to an enquiry as to
                            whether the Foreign Minister’s statement means the eventual return to
                            China of such foreign possessions as Macao and Hongkong he said that he
                            does not think concessions such as those mentioned could be taken to be
                            implied in his statement. On the subject of a recent American loan to a
                            corporation trading with China Mr. Arita made several comments reported
                            elsewhere (despatch 3536, December 22, 1938<note n="53"
                                xml:id="d133fn53">Not printed.</note>). On relations with the Soviet
                            Union he refused to go into details.</p>
                        <p>The statement by the Premier of December 22 is of more basic importance.

                            statement is in the form of a declaration of what Japan demands of
                            China. The introductory paragraphs repeat sentiments expressed before,
                            and the demands are then led up to: (1) Japan desires China to enter of
                            her own will into complete diplomatic relations with “Manchukuo”; (2)
                            Japan considers it an essential condition of the adjustment of
                            Sino-Japanese relations that there be concluded an anti-comintern
                            agreement between the two countries in consonance with the spirit of the
                            anti-comintern agreement between Japan, Germany, and Italy;<note n="55"

                            demands that Japanese troops be stationed, as an anti-comintern measure,
                            at specified points during the time the agreement is in force, and also
                            that the Inner Mongolian region be designated as a special
                            anti-comintern area; (4) Japan demands that China recognize freedom of
                            residence and trade on the part of Japanese subjects in the interior of
                            China with a view to promoting the economic interests of both people;
                            and (5) Japan demands that China extend to Japan facilities for the
                            development of China’s natural resources, especially in the regions of
                            north China and Inner Mongolia. The pronouncement refers to Japanese
                            respect for the sovereignty of China and states that Japan is prepared
                            to give positive consideration to abolition of extraterritoriality and
                            return of the concessions. In the course of the declaration it is stated
                            that Japan does not intend to exercise economic monopoly in China nor
                            does she intend to demand of China to limit the interests of those
                            foreign powers <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0117"/>who grasp the
                            meaning of the new order and are willing to act accordingly.</p>

                        <p>The Premier’s statement is no doubt destined to play an important part in
                            the development of Japanese policy in China. It amounts to a 1938 model
                            of the twenty-one demands.<note n="57" xml:id="d133fn57">For

                            it can not be said to be surprising to those who have been following

                            significance to foreign interests with regard to the statement is that
                            it is unquestionably considered by the Japanese as conservative. It has
                            very little to say about the treatment which foreign interests are
                            expected to be accorded in China, and throws very little light on that
                            subject.</p>

                        <p>The Chinese and Foreign Governments interested in trade and investment in
                            China, have common interest in maintenance of the Chinese Currency in
                            the areas for the time being occupied by the Japanese. This Currency is
                            preferred over the Japanese controlled currency both by the Chinese
                            public and foreigners (other than Japanese) not only because of the
                            position which the Chinese Currency has enjoyed and the dislike of alien
                            currency sought to be foisted upon China, but because a free exchange
                            market exists for trade and legitimate personal operations in the
                            occupied areas.</p>
                        <p>If the Japanese controlled currency should supplant the Chinese one in
                            these areas, the Japanese could both finance thereby their political,
                            financial and economic enterprises and could exert a strangle hold upon
                            the foreign and Chinese activities to the extent that their control
                            could be maintained. It seems inevitable that they would introduce
                            currency and trade control like that enforced in Japan and China’s
                            northeastern provinces. Under such a regime individual exchange
                            transactions could take place only with the consent of the Japanese
                            authorities or their agents. This would effectively close the door to
                            freedom of economic opportunity and be contrary to the rights and
                            interests of foreign nationals.</p>
                        <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0118"/>
                        <p>Further Japanese action against the Chinese Currency is expected soon as
                            the Japanese measures of last March contemplated that the Chinese
                            Currency should not circulate in North China after a year. The Chinese
                            Government taking such action as is possible to maintain the position of
                            the Chinese Currency can do little at present to combat the Japanese
                            controlled currency in the occupied area. The Chinese Government
                            therefore earnestly hopes that the American Government will take such
                            action as it may find practicable to oppose (1) further progress of the
                            Japanese controlled currency, for example, acceptance for official use
                            in Concessions and Settlements and (2) measure[s] to force the Chinese
                            Currency from circulation and to prevent its use to pay for export
                            goods.</p>

                            opportunity is presented you make a specific reply informally and
                            tactfully to the request of the Chamber of Commerce for advice as to
                            action Americans should take in the event their rights and interests
                            encounter certain types of interference by local Japanese authorities.
                            You should point out that when American rights and interests are
                            violated the persons representing these interests should as promptly as
                            possible report the violations to an American diplomatic or consular
                            officer who will take appropriate action. The nature of this action
                            will, of course, depend entirely upon the circumstances of each
                            individual case. When violations of American rights and interests are
                            reported to the Department or to its representatives in the field the
                            Department, either directly or through these representatives, takes all
                            appropriate steps warranted by the circumstances with a view to
                            obtaining full respect for the affected American interests.</p>

                            Standard Vacuum Oil Company and Texas Oil Company report local sales are
                            increasing due to the fact that small quantities of petroleum products
                            are leaving Chefoo overland for interior. The Asiatic Petroleum Company,
                            a British corporation, reports two shipments have been held up by the
                            authorities. The American companies find inland dealers are not ordering
                            kerosene at Chefoo as there appears to be ample supplies of contraband
                            oil, probably from Dairen, in their possession, selling below prices
                            here.</p>

                        <p>47. Reference my No. 15, January 5, 9 a.m. Japanese Consul General called
                            on me today and said that press reports are giving the erroneous
                            impression that the Japanese are demanding complete domination and
                            control of the Shanghai Municipal Council, whereas their desire is for
                            closer cooperation and the sharing of responsibility in the present
                            situation by an increase in the number of Japanese police, higher rank
                            and increased authority for Japanese police officers, and the
                            appointment of a Japanese Secretary of the Council who with the American
                            Secretary-General and the British Secretary would participate in all
                            important decisions and action. I pointed out that the Japanese demands
                            which had been made known to the press by their own spokesman had
                            created a most unfavorable atmosphere for any negotiations or
                            discussions at this time, that the matter must be carefully studied,
                            that some of my colleagues may be under the necessity of referring it to
                            their home governments and awaiting instructions, and that in any event
                            the Council itself is without authority heavily to increase the budget
                            without the approval of the revenue payers, so that the matter is not
                            one which can be settled immediately.</p>

                            <item>I pointed out that the districts north of the Creek had not yet
                                been fully returned to the administration and control of the Council
                                and that there are press reports of repeated attacks on police
                                officers and firemen by the Japanese troops. I suggested that these
                                    <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0122"/>matters should be
                                corrected by the Japanese and a better atmosphere created for the
                                consideration of proposals for their increased cooperation in the
                                Municipal Administration.</item>

                                course, if a more friendly atmosphere can be created, for the
                                Council to meet the Japanese in a reasonable measure as, for
                                example, by appointing a Japanese Associate Secretary or Counselor
                                to maintain liaison with the Japanese authorities, the appointment
                                of an additional Japanese Deputy Commissioner of Police, and by some
                                reasonable increase in the number and rank of Japanese members of
                                the police force. We should object, however, to any proposal to
                                place all districts north of the Creek under the control of Japanese
                                police officers.</item>

                        <p>50. Reference my No. 15, January 5, 9 a.m., regarding Japanese demands on
                            the Municipal Council. In a letter to the Senior Consul the Italian
                            Consul General agrees completely with the Japanese point of view that
                            the responsibility of administration and police in the International
                            Settlement should be shared equally among the principally interested
                            powers including Italy which has on every occasion shared with the
                            Americans, British and Japanese the burden and heavy expense of
                            defending foreign life and property in the Settlement. He states that
                            while some of the recent incidents at Shanghai have been directed
                            against Italian military posts he agrees that it would have been
                            physically impossible for the police to prevent them but he feels sure
                            that the gradual addition of Japanese and Italian elements in the
                            Municipal Administration and police on the same footing as Americans and
                            British will increase efficiency and insure a better and safer
                            evacuation [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of the International

                        <p>28. Reference your 15, January 5, 9 a.m., and 47, January 9, 6 p.m., in
                            regard to International Settlement. In addition to the issues of a
                            general character raised by the Japanese memoranda summarized and
                            discussed in your telegrams, the specific requests made by the Japanese
                            immediately suggest (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that the questions raised
                            concern the administrative functions of the Municipal Council in which
                            field the Council exercises a large measure of independence of action in
                            relation to the Treaty Powers; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) that the
                            Department has no direct intimation of the attitude and desires of the
                            Municipal Council in the matter; and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) that the
                            large British interests at Shanghai would seem to render it appropriate
                            that the initiative in any diplomatic or consular action which may be
                            requested by the Council should rest with the British authorities.</p>
                        <p>With the foregoing in mind the Department offers for your consideration
                            the following broad views in the hope that they may prove helpful to you
                            in your consideration of the situation with which the Municipal Council
                            is confronted.</p>
                        <p>The Department is of the opinion that the Council and the Consular Body
                            should insist upon respect for their responsibilities and functions with
                            regard to the administration of the International Settlement. Attempts
                            by the Japanese to interfere with or encroach upon the administrative
                            functions of the Council should be opposed by the Council, and by the
                            Consular Body if its assistance is requested. Under present
                            circumstances, however, it would seem reasonable as well as expedient to
                            exercise the utmost caution and to take appropriate measures to the end
                            that the Settlement not become a center for subversive activities,
                            including, of course, activities of an anti-Japanese character. With
                            regard to increased Japanese participation and authority in the
                            administration and policing of the Settlement, it is felt that practical
                            considerations point to the advisability of meeting in due course and in
                            an orderly way reasonable Japanese desires in so far as practicable.
                            There would seem to be some reason for hoping that increased Japanese
                            participation in the administration and policing of the Settlement might
                            have the desirable effect of causing the Japanese to feel a greater
                            responsibility for the preservation of the integrity of the Settlement
                            without seriously disturbing present administrative machinery and
                            control.</p>
                        <p>In general, the Department feels that the foreign governments which have
                            common interests and a common concern regarding the status and condition
                            of the International Settlement and their official representatives and
                            the authorities of the Municipal Administration <pb n="120"
                                xml:id="pg_120" facs="0124"/>should take the position, and should
                            make use of the principle, in discussions of this matter with Japanese
                            officialdom, that questions relating to the International Settlement,
                            especially proposals for changes in the composition of the municipal
                            staff and in administrative practices, etc., should be dealt with on the
                            basis of law, treaty rights, and considerations of justice and
                            efficiency, rather than on a basis of the wishes of any one power
                            supported by military force and pleading considerations of military
                            necessity. It can reasonably be pointed out that the Japanese have
                            repeatedly affirmed it their intention to respect the rights and
                            interests of other powers, that neither the Chinese authorities nor any
                            foreign governments have relinquished or waived in Japan’s favor any of
                            their rights and obligations in law or by treaty, and that the whole
                            situation at Shanghai is one of continuing and important concern to all
                            powers which have contacts with and interests in China and in trade with
                            China.</p>
                        <p>The Department is thoroughly in accord with the points made by you in
                            your conversation with the Japanese Consul General, as reported in
                            paragraphs 1 and 2 of your telegram No. 47, and is also in accord with
                            the views expressed in paragraph 3 thereof.</p>
                        <p>The Department desires that you consult with your British colleague and
                            endeavor to ascertain for communication to the Department the British
                            attitude in regard to the situation.</p>
                        <p>Please repeat the foregoing telegram and your telegrams under reference

                        <p>64. British Chargé d’Affaires has sent to me and to the French Ambassador
                            paraphrases of his exchange of telegrams with London in regard to the
                            Municipal Council.</p>

                            <item>Following is summary of his message to London. Any concession to
                                Japanese now may be regarded by them as a surrender, therefore
                                threats of using force should not be permitted to drive the powers
                                into yielding on any major point. Council must take a firm line and
                                must be able to rely on moral support of the powers. He suggests
                                concurrence of his Foreign Office in the following advice to the
                                Council: Council should not give way to any Japanese demands before
                                consulting representative[s] of powers chiefly concerned. They
                                should reply in writing to Japanese Consul General that while they
                                    <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0125"/>have given most careful
                                consideration to the Japanese proposals they do not agree that
                                adoption would in any way bring about the desired result, namely, to
                                maintain peace and order and to suppress any form of manifestations
                                of foreign activity in the Settlement. The reply should contain [<hi
                                    rend="italic">continue?</hi>] that the proposals have been under
                                examination for a number of days and the question of their
                                expediency on other grounds has not yet been decided but in any case
                                the present political crisis embittered by national feelings is
                                hardly the moment to make any changes of such importance. The
                                Council who are merely guardians of interests of all nationalities
                                in the Settlement are reluctant therefore to resume discussion of
                                the grave problems involved until conditions have become more
                                normal. In any case they should not approve of suggestions advanced
                                unless assured that they were fully supported by other interested
                                powers. The reply might conclude by saying that a report embodying a
                                reasonable analysis of the situation with special reference to the
                                police is therefore being submitted to Senior Consul for
                                consideration by the Consular Body. This report should show how
                                Japanese have been taken in by the Council in recent years and deal
                                with objections to bringing in additional Japanese elements too
                                quickly.</item>

                            <item>Foreign Office replied to following effect: Since Japanese have
                                occupied the posts fully, they are temporarily exercising the
                                authority formerly wielded by the local administration. Therefore
                                demands made to the Council by Japanese or Chinese which would not
                                have been accepted from the formerly existing services must be
                                resisted as far as possible. If, however, the Council feels
                                themselves compelled to make any [concession?] to the Japanese
                                demands for increased representation, it should be clearly
                                understood that it is purely of a temporary nature. Later on when
                                conditions return to normal it should be possible to consider the
                                desirability of making any permanent change which would affect the
                                interests of other powers. Foreign Office agrees generally with
                                views expressed by the Chargé d’Affaires and approves the advice
                                which he proposes to give to the Council. The Chargé d’Affaire[s] is
                                instructed to keep in closest touch with the French and American
                                colleagues in examining these problems. Message concludes with the
                                statement that finally there is the possibility which might or might
                                not satisfy the private [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Japanese and
                                which should in any case only be taken up in the last resort of
                                attaching some Japanese officials to certain departments of the
                                Council as temporary observers, again on the strict understanding
                                that such appointments would only be of a temporary nature. Foreign
                                Office asks the views of the Chargé d’Affaires on this point.</item>

                            <item>Press reports from London published here say that the Foreign
                                Office is expected to instruct the British authorities that any new
                                and special measures found necessary should be expressly on a
                                temporary <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0126"/>basis and without
                                prejudice to a permanent arrangement which would affect other powers
                                with rights in the Settlement.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The French Ambassador mentioned this matter at a meeting with the
                                British Chargé d’Affaires and me yesterday morning. He was inclined
                                to agree that the Japanese approach as made was ill advised and that
                                we should endeavor to avoid early consideration of the Japanese
                                demands. The French however are not likely to contribute much to the
                                solution of the problems of the International Settlement, being
                                inclined to stand aside in such matters.</item>

                            <item>I shall be glad to receive the Department’s instructions as to any
                                advice which may be tendered to the American Chairman and one other
                                American member of the Council.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>I am of the opinion that the question of increased Japanese
                                representation in the municipal administrations and police has been
                                so long postponed because of the British attitude that the Japanese
                                will not be content to allow matters to drift and that it is
                                essential that something be done to establish improved relations
                                with the Japanese. I believe, however, that there should be no undue
                                haste and that discussions should be prolonged in order that the
                                effect of the Japanese demands may be dissipated. Then it may be
                                made known that “in pursuance of the established policy of the
                                Council of recent years” further increases in the Japanese
                                representation in the police will be included in the annual budget
                                which comes before the rate payers some time in April. It may be
                                found desirable to provide for an additional Japanese Deputy
                                Commissioner who shall be a police officer of experience and
                                training. There may be provision for improved rank for Japanese
                                police officers of experience and it may be desirable in some
                                districts to appoint Japanese as co-inspectors in charge functioning
                                alongside British inspectors. On the question of a Japanese
                                Secretary, I believe it would be desirable to make the frank and
                                friendly gesture of replacing the present Japanese Deputy Secretary
                                who is <hi rend="italic">persona non grata</hi> to the Japanese by a
                                more capable man who shall be given status as Associate Secretary
                                and who shall be chosen by the Council from amongst several suitable
                                candidates. I do not believe that the British proposal for
                                “temporary” measures will be well received by the Japanese; it is
                                likely to increase the antagonism. I also dislike the proposal for
                                temporary observers; it suggests too definitely an acceptance of the
                                idea that the Japanese being in military occupation of the Shanghai
                                area are entitled to exercise supervision over the Settlement
                                administration. I believe that if the British will agree to yield in
                                a reasonable measure we may be able to prevail upon the Japanese to
                                approach the subject in a more conciliatory manner.</item>

                        <p>There has as yet been no full meeting of the Council to consider the
                            Japanese demands. It is my understanding, however, that the British and
                            American members of the Council are now more or less of the same opinion
                            in regard to them, and that they are prepared to consider the Japanese
                            requests on their merits and to make some gradual and reasonable
                            provision for increased Japanese participation <pb n="124"
                                xml:id="pg_124" facs="0128"/>in the Settlement administration,
                            provided the Japanese on their part will take measures to improve
                            relations with the Settlement administration, restore the areas north of
                            the Soochow Creek to normal control of the Settlement police and other
                            authorities and take a reasonable view of the whole situation.</p>
                        <p>There is some disposition to delay consideration of the Japanese
                            proposals in order that the effect of the public “demands” of the
                            Japanese Consul General, supported by his military and naval associates,
                            may first be dissipated.</p>
                        <p>The Chairman of the Council tells me that some days ago he asked the
                            Japanese Consul General whether the latter could recommend a thoroughly
                            qualified Japanese police officer of experience, with a good knowledge
                            of English, who might be considered for appointment to the police
                            department, to act in liaison with the Commissioner and with the heads
                            of all divisions in reference particularly to Japanese affairs. The
                            Japanese Consul General undertook to make inquiry at Tokyo and to inform
                            the Chairman of the result. He has not yet done so, and any complaint of
                            delay in action on the part of the Council may naturally be ascribed to
                            that situation.</p>
                        <p>The report of the Secretary of the Council in reference to the desire of
                            the Japanese for more senior representation in the Secretariat makes no
                            recommendation for the appointment of a Japanese Associate or
                            Co-Secretary; but I understand that if it becomes necessary or
                            desirable, resort may be had to some such arrangement.</p>
                        <p>The report of the Commissioner of Police, which must be examined in
                            conjunction with enclosure 5 of my despatch No. 1141, of January 10,
                            1938, indicates that it may be possible to make some reasonable
                            adjustment to meet the Japanese in respect of police matters; and this
                            report taken along with the interest of the Chairman in finding a
                            thoroughly experienced and qualified senior Japanese police officer with
                            a good knowledge of English, may offer a solution of the problem so far
                            as it relates to the police administration.</p>
                        <p>I have had several friendly discussions with my Japanese colleague,
                            Consul General Suemasa Okamoto, on the subject of the Japanese relations
                            with the Council, and have told him frankly that I strongly deprecated
                            any attempt to obtain increased Japanese participation in the Settlement
                            administration by way of “demands” supported by his military and naval
                            forces. I pointed out that such measures would alienate foreign opinion
                            favorable to intelligent and just consideration of Japanese aspirations,
                            and that he would find no one willing to make any adjustments in the
                            face of any such “demands”. I also emphasized that there must be a
                            substantial improvement in the relations between the Japanese forces and
                            the Settlement administration, and that while the Japanese are seeking
                            greater representation in the <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0129"
                            />Settlement administration they must respect the authority and
                            jurisdiction of that administration and move promptly to restore the
                            areas north of the Soochow Creek to the normal control and
                            administration of the Settlement police and other authorities.</p>
                        <p>In one of my conversations with Mr. Okamoto, he mentioned to me that the
                            Japanese community is desirous not only of increased participation in
                            the Settlement administration; it desires also increased representation
                            on the Council. He stated that his community desires representation
                            equal to the British, who now have five members of British nationality
                            on the Council. He inquired whether the Americans would be disposed to
                            reduce their representation from two to one, if the British would reduce
                            their representation from five to four, so as to permit of an increase
                            in the Japanese representation from two to four and thus make Japanese
                            representation equal to the British.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. Okamoto bluntly that I could not follow him in any suggestion
                            that the Americans should give up one of their two seats on the
                            Municipal Council to a Japanese or to any other nationality, and that
                            even if I were so generous as to agree to such a proposal I was certain
                            that the American ratepayers would not do so, so that it was quite
                            useless to consider the matter.</p>
                        <p>The opportunity presented itself to remind Mr. Okamoto that the Council
                            is elected by the foreign ratepayers of the Settlement, that the
                            franchise belongs to these ratepayers under the Land Regulations, that
                            the franchise is dependent upon the payment of taxes and rates to the
                            Council, that in the past I had ascertained that the Japanese paid only
                            about 7 per cent of the rates and taxes, that the present status of the
                            Japanese community in its relation to financial support of the
                            Settlement administration has not been disclosed, but that he must
                            realize that the election of members of the Council is dependent upon
                            the votes of the ratepayers and if he expects to have any Japanese
                            members elected his community should see to it that the Japanese
                            residents pay their taxes and acquire the right of franchise.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Okamoto mentioned to me that a suggestion had been made to him by a
                            British friend that there should be a revision of the Land Regulations
                            and that definite provision should be made therein for a truly
                            international Council to consist of three Americans, three Britons,
                            three Japanese, and three other foreign nationals—German, Italian and
                            Scandinavian. I commented that this was an interesting proposal but that
                            he must realize that it would necessitate a revision of the Land
                            Regulations and such a revision is not possible at this time. I do not
                            know whether the Japanese will pursue the matter of increased
                            representation on the Council at present. The elections are due to be
                            held early in April. The American Community Committee has renominated
                            the present American members of the Council, <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126"
                                facs="0130"/>Mr. Cornell S. Franklin (Chairman of the Council) and
                            Mr. W. H. Plant. I understand there are to be some changes in the
                            British members of the Council, but they have not yet been made known.
                            My British colleague tells me that the Japanese Consul General mentioned
                            to him the desire to obtain more seats on the Council for Japanese, at
                            the expense of British representation, but the British Consul General
                            was apparently unwilling to consider the suggestion. I know however that
                            a year or more ago my then British colleague, Sir John Brenan, had under
                            consideration a recommendation to the British Foreign Office that the
                            British community agree to reduce their representation on the Council
                            and thus provide an additional seat for a Japanese (who would need to be
                            supported by British votes to be elected), but I understand that the
                            British fear that the Japanese and Chinese members may at any time form
                            an “Asiatic bloc” in Settlement matters. The present Council consists of
                            five British, two American and two Japanese (a total of nine foreign
                            members) and five Chinese. If the British were to reduce their
                            representation to four, the combined American-British vote would be six
                            against a possible combined Japanese-Chinese vote of eight. There is
                            some feeling that the Japanese may bring pressure to bear to determine
                            what five Chinese shall become members of the Council. The Chinese
                            members of the Council are elected by the Chinese Ratepayers
                            Association.</p>
                        <p>Unless there is direct interference by the Japanese military in the
                            Settlement administration, I hope that the American and British members
                            of the Council by a wise discretion and careful approach to the subject
                            can bring about improved relations with the Japanese and, considering
                            the Japanese desires on their merits, make provision for some reasonable
                            and gradual increase in Japanese participation in the Settlement
                            administration.</p>

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>On Monday, February 14th, the Senior Consul invited the American, British
                            and French Consuls General, the (American) Chairman of the Municipal
                            Council, and the (American) Secretary General and (British) Secretary of
                            the Council to meet with him informally to discuss the matter.</p>
                        <p>At that meeting, the British Consul General stated that he was prepared
                            to accept the recommendations of the American and British members of the
                            Council as set out in the enclosure to this despatch, emphasizing point
                            (1), that is, that no changes or concessions should be made until full
                            Council control is restored in that part of the Settlement which lies
                            north of the Soochow Creek and which is now under Japanese military
                            occupation.</p>
                        <p>I stated that I found myself in accord with the proposals of the American
                            and British members of the Council, but that I did not believe that they
                            would be found by the Japanese reasonably to meet their wishes and that
                            I thought that it might be necessary to consider further their demand
                            for a Japanese secretary.</p>
                        <p>The British Consul General—who had referred the matter to London—stated
                            that, for the time being, he is not prepared to agree to more than is
                            offered in the recommendations of the American and British members of
                            the Council, and he again stressed the necessity for the return of the
                            area north of the Soochow Creek to the control and administration of the
                            Council as a condition precedent to any concessions.</p>
                        <p>I informed my colleague that in several conversations with the Japanese
                            Consul General I had urged upon him the necessity of restoring the areas
                            north of the Soochow Creek to the full control and administration of the
                            Council, pointing out that he could not reasonably expect favorable
                            consideration of any Japanese requests until this had been done. I
                            proposed that the recommendations of the American and British members of
                            the Council should be submitted for the consideration of the full
                            Council and then presented for the information and consideration of all
                            the interested consular representatives (the Treaty Consuls; excepting
                            of course the Japanese). If they find general support, then they may be
                            made the basis of a memorandum to be handed to the Japanese Consul
                            General by the Chairman of the Council. This procedure was generally
                            acceptable.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, as an indication of the difficulties confronting the Council
                            in dealing with the areas of the International Settlement north of the

                                    American and British members of the Council dated February 4,
                                    1938, in reference to the arrangements for the return of Chinese
                                    to the areas north of the Creek and the desire of the Council to
                                    restore Chinese police to that area under supervision of the
                                    regular (foreign) police officers.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It will be noted from this report that the Japanese authorities were
                            willing to allow Chinese members of the police force to be sent to the
                            areas north of the Creek only if they were placed under the supervision
                            of the Japanese branch of the Police. The Municipal authorities were
                            unable to agree to this attempt to extend the authority of the Japanese
                            branch of the police in the areas north of the Creek. The Japanese
                            branch of the police has assumed a more or less independent attitude,
                            placing itself under the influence, if not direction, of the Japanese
                            military and naval authorities. The matter continues under discussion,
                            but meanwhile the Japanese have arranged to allow a limited number of
                            Chinese civilians to enter the areas under passes issued after the
                            submission of applications through a Shanghai Citizens Association—an
                            organization of uncertain responsibility recently set up by the Japanese
                            military authorities, the personnel of which is not publicly well known.
                            This action has drawn a protest from the Chairman of the Council to the
                            Senior Consul, a copy of which is enclosed.<note n="69" xml:id="d145fn1"
                                >Not printed.</note> This protest was laid before the full meeting
                            of the Consular Body on February 15th, when the Japanese Consul General
                            was present, and was referred to him for an explanation which he has
                            promised to give.</p>
                        <p>It will be seen from the foregoing that the whole matter of the Japanese
                            demands is being approached with considerable caution, difficulty and
                            delay. It is the hope that the Japanese finally may be brought to a
                            realization that they must fully restore the Council’s control and
                            administration in the northern districts before they can expect any
                            concessions from the Council.</p>
                        <p>I believe that for the time being the Japanese will suspend their efforts
                            to obtain increased Japanese representation on the Council itself, it
                            being realized that they do not have sufficient voting strength to force
                            the issue at a municipal election. I am inclined to the opinion that
                            after a new Chinese Government is set up, the Japanese will move for a
                            revision of the Land Regulations so as to provide in that manner for
                            increased Japanese representation.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                        <p>425. Reference proposals for increased Japanese participation in
                            administration of the International Settlement. Municipal Council has
                            handed Japanese Consul General a memorandum which had previously been
                            discussed with him and which it is understood is accepted as a
                            settlement of the question.</p>

                            <item>Memorandum states that the Council is prepared to make certain
                                changes in the police administration to meet Japanese aspirations
                                but that simultaneously the Japanese authorities should assist the
                                return to normal conditions by taking all practicable steps to
                                restore the full control of the Council in the areas north of the

                                for the abolition of the present special Japanese branch of the
                                police and for the division of the foreign branch into two sections,
                                the present Japanese branch to be known as section 2 and its members
                                to be eligible for transfer to section 1 when after trial and
                                experience they individually show their ability to take note [<hi
                                    rend="italic">part</hi>] in the general work of section 1, the
                                ultimate aim being that the two sections should become one. The rank
                                of constable is abolished in section 2 as in the present foreign
                                branch and all present Japanese constables as well as new appointees
                                are to be probationary sergeants. Council is willing to appoint
                                another Japanese as a special Deputy Commissioner provided he has
                                police experience in keeping with that rank and has a thorough
                                knowledge of English. (I understand that the Japanese are nominating
                                a high ranking police officer for the post.) The Council is also
                                willing to appoint an experienced Japanese police officer with
                                knowledge of English as associate division officer in one of the
                                divisions north of the Creek and may later appoint another such
                                officer.</item>

                            <item>In regard to the Secretariat, the memorandum points out that the
                                present Japanese Deputy Secretary has done good work and gained
                                valuable experience, that nothing would be gained by replacing him
                                and it would be inexpedient to change his rank, that he has direct
                                access to both the Chairman and the Secretary General, that he may
                                communicate directly with heads of departments in matters affecting
                                Japanese interests, and that steps will be taken to have him attend

                        <p>511. Reference my 425, March 19, 8 [<hi rend="italic">11</hi>] p.m.
                            Japanese Consul General yesterday handed Chairman of Municipal Council
                            letter acknowledging receipt of Council’s memorandum, expressing
                            appreciation of careful consideration of the Japanese requests, but
                            regretting that the Council could not accede to some of the proposals
                            and expressing the hope that the Council will consider their position
                            and meet the Japanese desires fully when the present tense situation is
                            mitigated and the financial condition of the Council is improved. He
                            then asked for the full implementing of the memorandum on the side of
                            the Council but was not very satisfactory in his response to the
                            inquiries of the Chairman as to the intention of the Japanese to move
                            simultaneously to restore full Council control in the areas north of the
                            Creek although he did say he intended to work for material and steady
                            amelioration of conditions.</p>
                        <p>I understand that as evidence of their good faith authorities of the
                            Council propose to proceed to appoint the special Deputy Commissioner of
                            Police nominated by the Japanese and then await indications of good
                            faith on the Japanese side before proceeding further.</p>

                        <p>It will be noted therefrom that the Japanese Consul General desires that
                            the Council proceed in the immediate future to carry out in full the
                            proposals contained in the Council’s reply to the Japanese demands,
                            while the Chairman of the Council pointed out that the Japanese
                            authorities are expected as an earnest of their good faith to take steps
                            simultaneously to restore Council control in the areas north of the
                            Creek.</p>
                        <p>It will further be observed that the Japanese Consul General is seeking
                            to assure that the new Japanese Special Deputy Commissioner of Police
                            shall have “command and supervision” over the Japanese members of the
                            force, which is not what is intended on the part of the Council.</p>
                        <p>I have had occasion recently in my telegrams to the Department to mention
                            that the new Japanese Consul General, Mr. S. Hidaka, (formerly Counselor
                            of Embassy and later Chargé d’Affaires after the recall of Ambassador
                            Kawagoe) does little more than support and advance the views of the
                            Japanese military. He is personally and socially agreeable, but unlike
                            his predecessor, Mr. S. Okamoto, who was finally “promoted” to the post
                            of Counselor of Embassy at London, he is not disposed to harmonize the
                            foreign and Japanese points of view and to seek solutions which will
                            respect both the foreign and Japanese interests involved. While his
                            predecessor was apparently close to the Japanese naval authorities, who
                            are generally willing to take a more reasonable view than the Japanese
                            military authorities, the new Consul General appears to be the
                            mouthpiece of the Japanese militarists, who give little evidence of any
                            desire or intention to respect foreign rights and interests.</p>
                        <p>In connection with this question of increased Japanese participation in
                            the Municipal administration, I enclose copy of an article<note n="71"
                                xml:id="d148fn71">Not printed.</note> which has appeared in the
                            local press quoting a Reuter despatch from Tokyo dated April 11th, in
                            which Mr. Chikayaki Akagi, now chief of the secretariat of the Overseas
                            Ministry, who has been nominated as the Special Deputy Commissioner of
                            the Shanghai Municipal Police, is quoted by the <hi rend="italic">Asahi
                                Shimbun</hi> as declaring that he is convinced that the Japanese
                            language “will and must” become the official language of the Shanghai
                            Municipal police service. This attitude on the part of Mr. Akagi does
                            not suggest that he is likely to be a particularly agreeable or friendly
                            element in the Municipal administration.</p>

                        <p>928. 1. The Hungjao Residents’ Association, an association composed of
                            residents of all nationalities residing in Hungjao and the current
                            [extra-] Settlement road area of Shanghai, are sponsoring a movement to
                            extend the boundaries of the International Settlement to cover in
                            general the area now embraced in the so-called outside roads area. This
                            entire question has become a live issue because (1) the area is now
                            being populated by squatters and refugees who are building shacks off of
                            the extra-Settlement roads; (2) police protection in the areas between
                            the roads is practically nonexistent since the disappearance of the
                            police of the Greater Shanghai Municipal Government and the substitution
                            of the “Tatao Government”; (3) the erection of flimsy factory buildings
                            in the area; (4) the depositing of incoffined corpses on various vacant
                            plots of land in the area; (5) the Japanese claim to succession to all
                            the rights and privileges heretofore enjoyed by the Chinese Government;
                            (6) a fear that the Japanese will attempt to exercise complete control
                            of the entire extra-Settlement area, especially the area between the
                            roads.</p>
                        <p>2. By reference to section 6 of the Land Regulations, copy of which is no
                            doubt available to the Department, it would appear that the Municipal
                            Council possesses no rights to police the outside roads nor to maintain
                            the roads, sewerage, drainage, et cetera, nor does it possess a right to
                            tax property abutting on the roads or to issue licenses of any sort. It
                            appears that under a “gentlemen’s agreement” arrived at by the Secretary
                            General of the Council and Mr. O. K. Yui, the Mayor of the former city
                            governments of Greater Shanghai, it was understood that the Council
                            should have the right to collect rates from occupiers of residences
                            abutting directly on the outside roads and to police the roads. This was
                            a temporary arrangement pending the conclusion of a definite agreement
                            concerning the whole of the outside roads area. The advent of
                            hostilities brought these negotiations to an end.</p>
                        <p>3. The Municipal Council fears that the time will soon arrive when an
                            attempt will be made to interpret the Land Regulations literally, which
                            would mean in effect the complete cessation of the very limited control
                            exercised by the Council in the area in question. There are indications
                            that the Japanese authorities may have in contemplation some such move.
                            The Council [is] finding it increasingly difficult to assert its already
                            meager authority and the situation as regards the land situated between
                            the extra-Settlement roads is becoming intolerable <pb n="133"
                                xml:id="pg_133" facs="0137"/>at present in that area. There is no
                            policing, no refuse collection, no supervision of sanitation, and filthy
                            squatters’ huts are springing up adjoining the property of foreign
                            residents, thus not only menacing the health of the inhabitants of that
                            area, but also menacing indirectly the health of the whole Shanghai
                            area.</p>
                        <p>4. The foregoing situation has been brought to my attention and to the
                            attention of the British Consul General by the Settlement authorities
                            with a request that it be communicated to our respective Governments
                            with a view to the possibility of finding some solution to the
                            situation. That solution might mean an effort to bring about the
                            inclusion of the area within the boundaries of the International
                            Settlement. It is scarcely necessary for me to comment on the situation
                            that obtained in the extra-Settlement roads area up to the time of the
                            beginning of hostilities, inasmuch as that situation is well known to
                            the Department. The conditions that now exist urgently require remedying
                            and while the attainment of the objective of the Hungjao residents may
                            become necessary [and?] this would undoubtedly solve the problem, the
                            principle involved does not seem to be in accord with the Department’s
                            policies and I have serious doubts also that the Japanese authorities
                            would view it with favor. I am likewise doubtful that the “Reformed
                            Government” would acquiesce in any such proposal which the Residents’
                            Association might advance to it. There is a disposition in some quarters
                            arbitrarily to extend the authority of the International Settlement to
                            the area in question by a formal administrative act and simply notify
                            the residents to that effect, supporting the action by an adequate
                            police. It is probable that a unilateral act of this kind would lead to
                            the greatest confusion and perhaps to unpleasant incidents. Inasmuch as
                            the Municipal Council authorities will shortly seek a conference with
                            myself and the British Consul General, I should be most grateful if the
                            Department would give me the benefit of its views on this subject for my
                            guidance.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Hidaka came to see me yesterday morning and discussed somewhat at
                            length the proclamation issued by the Shanghai Municipal <pb n="134"
                                xml:id="pg_134" facs="0138"/>Council with reference to the expulsion
                            from the Settlement of persons arrested for terrorist activities or
                            having in their possession arms or other evidence which might relate to
                            such activities.<note n="73" xml:id="d150fn73">See telegram No. 992,
                                July 14, 6 p.m., from the Consul General at Shanghai, <ref

                                    p. 225</ref>.</note> Mr. Hidaka seemed very pleased that the
                            Municipal Council had issued the proclamation, and he said that he hoped
                            they would even go further in their campaign against the terrorists, and
                            that extraordinary precautions should be taken to cover the period from
                            August 10 to August 15, which would mark the first anniversary of the
                            outbreak of hostilities at Shanghai. I told Mr. Hidaka that it seemed to
                            me that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Concession
                            authorities met the situation very well indeed on July 7, and that the
                            situation was brought under control within two or three hours after the
                            outbreak early in the morning of that day. I told Mr. Hidaka that in
                            ordinary circumstances my feeling was that such unlawful acts should be
                            handled by the appropriate courts, but that at least under the present
                            conditions a more drastic procedure seemed to be required, and that I at
                            least hoped that the measures adopted by the Council would be effective;
                            that in my judgment the Municipal Council and the French Concession
                            authorities were doing everything that could be well expected of them in
                            preserving order in the foreign areas; that the problem was greatly
                            aggravated by the enormous number of refugees in the city and the
                            extraordinary density of population which could doubtless not be matched
                            in any other city in the world.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hidaka said that he felt that the Municipal authorities were doing
                            everything they could, but that he nevertheless hoped that there would
                            be no slackening in their efforts; that he was quite sure the terrorism
                            was organized by certain agencies at Hankow; that he strongly felt that
                            the authorities of the French Concession and International Settlement
                            should adopt strong measures for preventing the influx of unlawful
                            elements, and to that end he suggested a strict inspection of all
                            Chinese passengers arriving by steamer from any direction.</p>

                            the question under reference, the following observations are submitted
                            for your guidance:</p>
                        <p>The Department is of the opinion that the authority conferred on the
                            Municipal Council by article VI of the Land Regulations for the
                            “maintenance” of extra-Settlement roads dedicated to public use “for the
                            health …<note n="78" xml:id="d151fn78">Omission indicated in the
                                original.</note> of all persons residing within the Settlement” and
                            the authority which, according to your paragraph 2, is understood to
                            have been granted by the informal agreement with the mayor of Greater
                            Shanghai, reasonably warrant the adoption of all emergency measures
                            essential to protect the health of residents of the Settlement from the
                            serious menace which the conditions of which you speak seem to involve.
                            The Department is aware that the execution of those measures in a manner
                            that will not encounter opposition from the Japanese may be a problem to
                            be faced by the agencies of the Municipal Council.</p>
                        <p>Pending return of normal conditions in Shanghai and an opportunity to
                            negotiate with the lawful authorities for the definitive adjustment of
                            extra-Settlement road problems, the Department considers that it would
                            be unwise and, in view of existing conditions, probably futile to deal
                            with the extra-Settlement area on any other than an emergency basis for
                            the protection of the health of the residents of the International
                            Settlement.</p>

                            conditions:. (1) increased Japanese representation on the Settlement
                            police and (2) replacement of the present Chinese courts in the
                            Settlement by “impartial” courts appointed by the Ta Tao government of
                            Shanghai.</p>
                        <p>Asked for my reaction to these conditions, I expressed the personal view
                            that point 1 might not be particularly difficult if the Japanese request
                            is reasonable as it has been the intention of the Municipal Council
                            gradually to increase Japanese on the force, but as to point 2 it seemed
                            to me that it would be difficult to acquiesce in judicial appointments
                                <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0143"/>to the courts of the
                            Settlement by the hopelessly weak ineffective puppet government at
                            Shanghai which has no real authority or control and that such
                            appointments by the so-called Reformed Government at Nanking would seem
                            equally unacceptable for the same reasons. British Ambassador responded
                            that my reaction on point 2 is precisely the same as that of his staff
                            advisers. As to point 1, he inquired whether we had ever considered
                            matching Japanese demands patterned after demands for increased American
                            representation on the police. I replied that I had several times told my
                            Japanese colleague that he was setting a bad precedent in his demands on
                            the Council and that he had consistently replied that the Japanese would
                            support us in any demands equally as reasonable as the Japanese.</p>

                            contemplated in that understanding.</p>
                        <p>Several weeks ago it was proposed that the Japanese Consul General be
                            invited to meet informally with the Chairman and executive officers of
                            the Municipal Council and the American and British Consuls General, to
                            discuss the unsatisfactory situation north of Soochow Creek. The
                            Japanese Consul General, Mr. Shinrokuro Hidaka, indicated his
                            willingness to attend such a conference but expressed the desire first
                            to have an informal discussion with the Chairman of the Council at which
                            he handed to the Chairman two sets of proposals, marked “A” and “B”,
                            copies of which (sent to me by the Acting Secretary of the Council on
                            November 5th) are enclosed<note n="88" xml:id="d158fn88">Neither
                                printed.</note> with this despatch.</p>
                        <p>These “proposals” include the undertakings of the Council under the
                            understanding of March 1938, and add provisions which would in effect
                            give the Japanese substantially complete police control of the whole of
                            the areas of the International Settlement north of Soochow Creek by
                            providing that Japanese police officers shall be in charge of the police
                            divisions in that area and that Japanese officers shall also be in
                            charge of the police stations in the areas of large Japanese population.
                            It is also proposed to set up a “joint committee” of Japanese military,
                            naval and consular representatives and representatives of the Municipal
                            Police “with a view to ensuring the smooth and harmonious functioning of
                            the police” in the divisions north of the Creek.</p>
                        <p>After several delays and postponements, the proposed informal conference
                            with the Japanese Consul General was held on Monday, December 5th.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hidaka was accompanied by his senior staff Consul, Mr. Goto. The
                            (American) Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council was supported by a
                            British member of the Council, the (American) Secretary General of the
                            Council, the (British) Secretary of the Council, and a (British) Deputy
                            Secretary. The American and British Consuls General attended without
                            staff.</p>
                        <p>The conference lasted over several hours which were devoted principally
                            to unconvincing explanations from Mr. Hidaka on the necessity of solving
                            the police problem in the northern areas by adopting and implementing
                            his “proposals”, whereupon, in his opinion, the other problems of the
                            northern areas would solve themselves more or less as a matter of
                            course. But when asked for positive assurance that with the solution of
                            the police problem the northern areas would be returned to normal
                            municipal control and be thrown open to residence and trade in the same
                            manner as other <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0145"/>sections of the
                            Settlement, Mr. Hidaka was obliged to admit that he was not in a
                            position to give any assurance on any point. He directed attention to
                            the anti-Japanese “terrorism” in Shanghai, to the continuing
                            Sino-Japanese hostilities, and to the likelihood that there will for
                            some time be large numbers of Japanese soldiers in and around Shanghai
                            (including the northern areas of the Settlement). He made it quite
                            evident that there is no present intention on the part of the Japanese
                            military authorities to return the northern areas of the Settlement to
                            Council control in the near future, notwithstanding assertions that the
                            present situation is temporary, that the Japanese have “no ambitions”
                            affecting the future of this part of the Settlement, and that there is
                            an intention gradually to lift the present restrictions in the area as
                            conditions from time to time may permit.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hidaka offered no satisfactory reason for dividing his “proposals”
                            into two memoranda, marked “A” and “B”; he said that he did not wish to
                            “frighten” the Council by presenting too numerous demands in one
                            memorandum; and that as a matter of fact “B” included items which are
                            already being carried out but on which the Japanese feel that the
                            efforts should be intensified. I understand from the Chairman of the
                            Council that Mr. Hidaka intimated to him that the items of memorandum
                            “A” are more or less mandatory on the Council, while there is not quite
                            so much insistence upon some of the items of memorandum “B”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hidaka attempted to minimize any concern as to the proposed “joint
                            committee” of Japanese military, naval and consular representatives and
                            representatives of the Muncipal Police to ensure the “smooth and
                            harmonious” functioning of the police in the northern areas. He pointed
                            out that there had been conferences between these authorities in the
                            past, when special precautions were agreed upon to be taken on Chinese
                            anniversaries and holidays, and all that was desired was a continuance
                            of this collaboration and cooperation. This explanation to me is
                            unsatisfactory and unconvincing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hidaka attempted no real defense of the charge that the Japanese have
                            failed to carry out their undertaking to move as rapidly as possible
                            toward the return of the northern areas to Municipal Council control; he
                            admitted that he could point to nothing concrete done by the Japanese to
                            that end; he could only say that he felt that tension had been “eased”
                            and that there existed a “better feeling”, but he went on to emphasize
                            the necessity of reassuring the Japanese military and other authorities
                            and the Japanese residents by measures for satisfactory (Japanese
                            dominated) police control in the area, et cetera.</p>
                        <p>I took occasion during the discussions to state that I had been one of
                            those who had recommended careful and sympathetic consideration of the
                            Japanese requests made last January; that I now felt that the <pb
                                n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0146"/>Japanese side had failed and
                            had offered no satisfactory explanation of their failure to carry out
                            their obligations under the March understanding; that our Japanese
                            colleague now confronted us with additional requests to be met by the
                            Municipal Council, and when asked to give an assurance that if these
                            requests are met, the areas north of the Soochow Creek will be restored
                            to normal Council control, he tells us that he is unable to give any
                            assurance whatsoever on these points. I pointed out that this
                            represented a most unsatisfactory state of affairs; that emphasis has
                            been placed by the Japanese side on the necessity of reassuring the
                            Japanese military and the Japanese residents, but that there is no
                            evidence of a disposition on the Japanese side to give consideration to
                            the rights and interests of other foreign nationalities; and as
                            indicating the unsatisfactory situation with respect of foreign
                            interests I pointed to the conditions in the foreign extra-Settlement
                            residential areas to the west of Shanghai where Japanese gendarmes are
                            commanding and augmenting the Chinese police forces of the new Japanese
                            sponsored local regime, and where gambling hells, opium dens, and
                            narcotic vendors are permitted to flourish in large numbers. I urged
                            that the Japanese give proper consideration to both foreign and Japanese
                            interests in the solution of local problems.</p>
                        <p>The conference adjourned following a statement of the Chairman of the
                            Council that the matter would be studied by the Council.</p>
                        <p>On the morning of December 7th, the Chairman of the Council told me that
                            the American and British members of the Council had met and thoroughly
                            examined the situation, reaching the conclusion that it will be
                            necessary for the Council to make further concessions to the Japanese
                            and to hope that when the police are finally reestablished in control of
                            the northern areas it may be possible to extend the municipal control
                            gradually and finally restore the areas to normal. To this end, it is
                            proposed that he call on the Japanese Consul General and offer him a
                            compromise proposal suggested by the Commissioner of Police (in a
                            report, of which a copy is enclosed<note n="89" xml:id="d158fn89">Not
                                printed.</note>) that a special division to be known as “E” division
                            be established in the northern section of the Hongkew area (the
                            principal area of Japanese residence), that a carefully selected
                            Japanese police officer be placed in charge of that division, that a
                            Japanese associate divisional officer be provided to function for
                            divisions “C” and “D”, and that an understanding be reached rejecting
                            certain possible Japanese candidates for the appointment. In short, the
                            Council will offer some further concessions to the Japanese and proceed
                            to implement the understanding fully, hoping thus to restore the police
                            to control in the northern areas, with the thought that thereafter they
                            may gradually induce <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0147"/>the
                            Japanese to discard present restrictions, such as the system under which
                            permits and passes must be obtained for all movement of foreign cargo
                            out of that area, for all Chinese entering the area, including even
                            chauffeurs and employees of foreigners, et cetera. It is hoped that it
                            may be possible eventually to restore the street car and bus services
                            and permit the return of Chinese to the areas for residence without
                            undue restrictions.</p>
                        <p>I am particularly interested to note that the British members of the
                            Council, who but a few weeks ago were insistent that the Japanese must
                            be faced with a firm refusal to make any concessions until the whole
                            northern areas are returned to full and complete municipal control, have
                            now been prevailed upon by the British Consul General to take a
                            decidedly more conciliatory attitude.</p>
                        <p>I regret to say that I do not expect this changed attitude toward the
                            Japanese to be productive of any satisfactory results at this time.</p>
                        <p>I shall keep the Department informed of developments.</p>

                        <p>Bocca Tigris forts bombarded intensely today by three Japanese ships.
                            Foreign vessels starting this morning from Hong Kong to Canton and
                            Canton to Hong Kong returned to port of departure, those from Canton
                            under orders of Chinese military authorities. Understood Pearl River not

                            reported from Kongmoon that this has been done in anticipation of
                            surprise attack. Local authorities there say they expect about 100
                            fishing junks and motor boats to come from Formosa with 7000

                        <p>It has been the practice for many years for units of the United States
                            Asiatic Fleet, whose headquarters are at Manila, to spend the summer
                            season, from early in May to early in November, in north China waters.
                            The flagship and the destroyer squadron, usually comprising some eleven
                            or twelve units, generally base on Chefoo, and the <pb n="146"
                                xml:id="pg_146" facs="0150"/>submarine flotilla, usually comprising
                            seven or eight units, generally bases on Tsingtao. It is, of course,
                            considered very desirable, from the point of view of health and general
                            welfare, that the personnel of these vessels pass the summer months in
                            places where the climate is fresher and more bracing than it is in
                            Philippine waters.</p>
                        <p>During the past few months both Chefoo and Tsingtao have been occupied by
                            the Japanese army. Apparently this step has taken place with little
                            disorder, and there is at present little indication of any organized
                            resistance on the part of the Chinese inhabitants. It is possible,
                            therefore, that a visit of the fleet to these cities during the coming
                            summer would be accomplished without any serious difficulty.
                            Furthermore, a failure of the fleet to pay its customary visit to these
                            ports might lead to the undesirable impression that we were unduly
                            influenced by political changes in that area to which the American
                            Government objects.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if the fleet should visit north China this year, the
                            Government might be subjected to criticism on the ground that it had
                            failed to exercise sufficient precaution toward avoiding a possible
                            incident. There have been indications that the long campaign in China
                            has tended in certain instances to affect adversely the morale and
                            conduct of various units of the Japanese army. The bombing of the U. S.

                            other recent incidents involving Japanese and American military units
                            may also have tended to ruffle the tempers of the rank and file of the
                            American fleet. In the circumstances, the possibilities of friction at
                            Chefoo and Tsingtao between the personnel of the two armed forces should
                            be given serious consideration.</p>
                        <p>Tsingtao is one of the main ports of north China. It is the terminus of a
                            railway which joins at Tsinan with the Tientsin-Pukow railway, the main
                            artery of communication between north and central China. Although it is
                            understood that this railway has been cut in several places by Chinese
                            agents, yet it will probably be repaired and in good running order
                            before summer. Offering better port facilities than Tientsin, Tsingtao
                            is an important port for the landing of troops and munitions from Japan.
                            In view of the recent increased activity of the Chinese air force, it is
                            within the range of possibility that an effort will be made to bomb the
                            city. The presence of American vessels in the port might then be a
                            source of serious embarrassment to this Government.</p>
                        <p>Although no port in North China is completely free from political tension
                            and an extended visit from the United States Asiatic Fleet <pb n="147"
                                xml:id="pg_147" facs="0151"/>to any North China port would therefore
                            be attended by some risk of incidents affecting Japanese-American
                            relations, it is felt that, in as much as (1) there is no railway
                            communication between Chefoo and Central China, (2) there has been an
                            almost complete absence of disturbances at Chefoo during the present
                            crisis, and (3) there would seem to be slight probability that large
                            contingents of Japanese troops will be stationed at Chefoo, the risk of
                            incidents at that port would be considerably less than elsewhere in
                            North China. It is therefore recommended, if it is decided that the
                            advantages of a visit by the Fleet outweigh the disadvantages, that the
                            Fleet confine its regular summer visit to Chefoo. Units of the Fleet
                            might pay occasional visits from Chefoo to Tsingtao. Consideration might
                            be given also to arranging that the number of units of the Fleet
                            visiting north China be smaller than usual and that the period of the
                            visit be shorter than has been the case in the past.<note n="96"

                                measures to make even more effective the blocking of communications
                                at the mouth of the Pearl River near Canton, and, according to
                                recent reports, vessels proceeding from Kwangchou Bay along the
                                China coast to Hong Kong are frequently entering and leaving the
                                area of operations of the Japanese Navy. Among such vessels, there
                                are a number which proceed on courses which render them liable to be
                                confused with enemy vessels. I have the honor accordingly to request
                                that the information be communicated to vessels belonging to your
                                country that, whenever passing south of the mouth of the Pearl

                                    now extensively using junks for the transportation of arms and
                                    munitions in the vicinity of Canton with a view to invading the

                                    by the Japanese Navy. In the event of occasion arising for
                                    making even more strict the control of such junks, it may become
                                    necessary to subdue by force those junks which offer resistance.
                                    Accordingly, with a view to avoiding unfortunate incidents
                                    arising involving junks belonging to third countries, it is

                                            regions still infested today by large numbers of
                                            stragglers of the defeated armies and by bandits, which
                                            the Japanese forces are doing their utmost to suppress
                                            and to maintain order. Not only can it not yet be said
                                            that the military operations in these areas have reached
                                            a decisive stage, but also the course of the Yangtze
                                            from Shanghai to Nanking and Wuhu, constitutes one of
                                            the most important strategic lines of communication of
                                            our forces in Central China. To open this section to
                                            navigation by general merchant shipping would be to
                                            court the grave danger of our strategic secrets falling
                                            into the hands of the Chinese and, in the above
                                            circumstances, it is not yet possible to open the
                                            Yangtze to the free navigation of the shipping of the
                                            powers.</p>
                                        <p>Further, the permit system, which was enforced on the
                                            21st March covering navigation on the internal waterways
                                            of the Central China region, is a provisional
                                            arrangement based upon consideration of the dangers
                                            attending free navigation and upon strategical
                                            necessity. It is therefore earnestly hoped that the
                                            British side will also appreciate the above facts and
                                            cooperate in the smooth enforcement of the system and
                                            will see to it that British ships intending to navigate
                                            the rivers in the area in question will acquire the
                                            permits issued in conformity with the system by the
                                            military and naval authorities.’</p>

                            matter. By way of comment I may add that American naval vessels are
                            already distinguished from Chinese vessels by deck painted white with
                            buff upper works and therefore easily distinguishable. Furthermore, as
                            demonstrated in the case of the <hi rend="italic">Panay</hi>, one place
                            on the river is no safer than another if Japanese do not intend to
                            respect interests of third nationals. Positions of American naval
                            vessels have from time to time been and will continue to be notified to
                            Japanese so that they can easily be put on notice as to where they are
                            and where their duties require them to be.</p>

                                    <item>I have communicated a reply to Minister Tani, the
                                        substance of which is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                            <p>‘I have been advised by Admiral Yarnell that there
                                                are no United States vessels in the Yangtze between
                                                Wuhu and Hukow at this date. However, Admiral
                                                Yarnell plans to visit in that vicinity on the 24th
                                                and 25th off shore in the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic"
                                                  >Isabel</hi>. It will depend on what assistance
                                                American nationals may need in that locality as to
                                                future presence of our vessels there, at which time
                                                due notice will be given to both the Chinese and
                                                Japanese, and this will include areas above Hukow.
                                                Admiral Yarnell also adds that due care will be
                                                taken as to unnecessary exposure in those areas, but
                                                that assistance to Americans evacuating is of
                                                paramount importance to the Navy and will be carried
                                                out; and the information given in Tani’s letter of
                                                June 11 does not in the slightest degree relieve the
                                                Japanese Government of responsibility for any harm
                                                to our vessels or personnel. Further, that our
                                                vessels are painted white and have large flags
                                                painted on their awnings, and should be apparent

                        <p>900. The Japanese military who seized the vessels and equipment of the
                            Whangpoo Conservancy Board soon after the present hostilities began have
                            persistently refused to return these vessels and equipment to the
                            Conservancy Board, and have forced the abandonment of the general
                            conservancy work and used some of the vessels for dredging along the
                            Japanese owned wharves in the Whangpoo. All efforts to persuade them to
                            restore the conservancy work to normal have failed and shipping
                            companies have in recent weeks been forced to fall back upon private
                            dredging operations. This question was gone into with the Japanese
                            Consul General by the Senior Consul, the British Consul General and
                            myself recently and it was pointed out that the Whangpoo is rapidly
                            deteriorating as a navigable stream. The Japanese insist that, as a
                            condition precedent to returning the vessels and equipment to the
                            control of the Conservancy Board, the Board agree to the appointment of
                            a Japanese engineer-in-chief along with a secretary to be attached to
                            the Board, a second officer on one of the dredgers, a third officer on
                            another, a second engineer on still another, and a chief officer of a
                            buoy tender, all to be of Japanese nationality. It is possible that the
                            Board, which may seek the concurrence of the interested consular
                            officers, while agreeing to the appointment of the subordinate officers
                            above mentioned, will propose as an alternative to the Japanese
                            proposals that the title of the new engineer post shall be associate
                            engineer-in-chief and that the appointment shall be only for the
                            duration of the Sino-Japanese conflict; that the present Chinese
                            engineer-in-chief shall remain in office; that the new associate
                            engineer-in-chief shall possess the [<hi rend="italic">a?</hi>] good
                            knowledge of English; that all vessels, equipment, et cetera, shall be
                            returned to the Whangpoo Conservancy Board before the associate engineer
                            assumes office, and that a definite date for the resumption of normal
                            conservancy work shall be given.</p>
                        <p>2. I am doubtful whether the Japanese will agree to this alternative
                            proposal, but I should like to know whether the Department perceives any
                            objection to my associating myself with my other interested colleagues
                            in recommending a settlement of the controversy substantially on the
                            above lines. The fact remains that if the conservancy work is not
                            resumed in the reasonably near future, the conditions along the Whangpoo
                            will be such that large vessels cannot enter the port of Shanghai.</p>

                                    and destroyed approximately 300 of them, there are yet many more
                                    drifting in the muddy waters and are a source of great danger
                                    because no safety device has been attached to them. And as the
                                    Chinese make their retreat, taking advantage of every little
                                    creek and by the use of gunboats, mine-layers, small steamers
                                    and junks, they are continuing their mine-laying operations.
                                    Cooperating with these river units are other Chinese forces
                                    lurking all along both banks of the river; and it must be
                                    expected that fighting will continue in this area for some time
                                    to come.</p>
                                <p>Consequently we hope it may be understood that the time has not
                                    yet come when the Commander-in-Chief of the China Seas Fleet, I.
                                    J. N., can consider that no tactical difficulties will be
                                    presented by the entry of naval vessels and other ships of third
                                    powers into the above-mentioned area.</p>
                                <p>(2) With the occupation of Hukow by the Japanese forces, the
                                    section of the Yangtze River between Hukow and Hankow, as well
                                    as the lake districts adjacent thereto, has already become a
                                    battlefield. Especially intensive fighting is taking place in
                                    the area between Hukow and Whangshikong, where the Chinese
                                    forces now appear to be busily engaged in laying mines in the
                                    river. And as it is necessary for our fleet to shell and bomb
                                    the vessels thus engaged, as well as the forts on the river
                                    bank, it is hoped that all naval vessels and other ships of
                                    third powers will leave this danger zone as quickly as possible
                                    in order to avoid any casualties.</p>
                                <p>(3) Near Matung, the Chinese had constructed an extremely strong
                                    boom across the Yangtze River completely cutting off all
                                    traffic. <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0159"/>Upon taking
                                    possession of this boom, our fleet opened a passage through it.
                                    This passage, however, has been opened solely for reasons of
                                    military necessity, so that our consent to its use by any vessel
                                    other than those of our naval and military forces cannot be
                                    given until such time as the Commander-in-Chief considers that
                                    such use will not interfere with the operations of the Japanese
                                    forces.</p>
                                <p>(4) With regard to our request that some way be devised to render
                                    the vessels of third powers more easily recognizable, we deeply
                                    regret that the replies received from the powers concerned were
                                    to the effect that they considered the flags printed on the
                                    awnings to be sufficient. From the experiences of our air forces
                                    in the present hostilities, we have found that it is impossible
                                    for a flyer to distinguish anything like a flag painted on the
                                    awning unless he comes so low as to be greatly exposed to the
                                    enemy’s anti-aircraft artillery fire; and that, even at such low
                                    altitude, such factors as the position of the vessel in relation
                                    to the sun, direction in which the vessel is pointed and the
                                    direction of attack may make it extremely difficult to
                                    distinguish such marking. There are, moreover, cases in which it
                                    is almost impossible to distinguish the flags from any distance
                                    because they have faded and the awning has become soiled with
                                    the passage of time.</p>
                                <p>It was for such reasons as these that the earlier request was
                                    especially made. We deeply appreciate the good will shown by the
                                    Standard Oil Company in making its vessels clearly
                                    distinguishable by painting the upper half of their hulks. With
                                    regard to all other foreign vessels, we cannot but request the
                                    authorities and interests concerned once more that, upon
                                    reconsideration of this matter, they might arrange to have the
                                    vessels made more easily distinguishable by some such device as
                                    having them painted in special colors, by flying long streamers
                                    from the masthead, by means of lights, et cetera, and thus
                                    cooperate with us in our effort to prevent unpleasant questions
                                    with third powers arising through mistakes.</p>
                                <p>(5) Since the use of flags of third powers by the Chinese on
                                    their vessels, buildings and other establishments might give
                                    rise to situations mutually objectionable and unpleasant, it is
                                    hoped that strict measures will be taken by the powers concerned
                                    to prevent such use by the Chinese.</p>
                                <p>(6) The hearty cooperation which the powers have given in many
                                    ways to meet the request which the Commander-in-Chief of the
                                    China Seas Fleet made out of his desire to prevent mutually
                                    undesirable casualties to foreign vessels of war and other ships
                                    is deeply appreciated. Especially helpful have been the detailed
                                    reports we have received concerning the movements of foreign
                                    ships, and we hope that we may continue to be informed of the
                                    positions and movements of foreign ships above Hukow without
                                    delay.</p>
                                <p>Contact between the Japanese naval authorities and the powers
                                    concerned should, for the most part, be maintained as heretofore
                                    between the naval representatives at Shanghai.”</p>

                                        flags on masts or spread of awnings are not visible from
                                        great heights, and as the river from a height appears white
                                        and the color of a vessel’s hull therefore is difficult to
                                        distinguish, the Japanese Navy desires that appropriate
                                        distinguishing mark(s) be used by the <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>218. Department’s 214, July 24, 1 p.m., in regard to American naval
                            vessels and telegram 0024–1054 of the Commander of the Yangtze
                                Patrol<note n="16" xml:id="d184fn16">Latter not printed.</note>
                            reporting location of foreign naval vessels on the Yangtze.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the hope expressed in my telegram under reference that no
                            unfortunate incident will occur through the presence of American naval
                            vessels in zones of intensive military operation, I had in mind not only
                            the <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> but especially our vessels now
                            stationed at Hankow if and when the Japanese approach that city. It is
                            assumed that you and the Commander of the Yangtze Patrol are keeping in
                            close touch with your interested colleagues and associates in regard to
                            appropriate cooperation and coordination in the activities and
                            stationing of the vessels of the different foreign patrols. I am
                            confident that, in process of such consultation, you are giving careful
                            consideration to the question of disposal and operation of American
                            vessels in a manner calculated to enable them most effectively to carry
                            out their missions of affording reasonable protection to Americans and
                            at the same time to avoid incurring undue risks.</p>
                        <p>Please keep me fully informed of all developments bearing upon the above
                            problem.</p>

                        <p>466. [Following to Chefoo:] Your July 25, 2 p.m., has been repeated to
                            Tokyo. Embassy is pleased that both incidents are settled but notes that
                            5 days elapsed between the occurrence of first incident and your
                            reporting thereon and that without obtaining instructions you took
                            formal action involving acceptance of conditions in the first incident
                            including formal expression of regrets by you as American Consul. In
                            this particular connection, the Embassy is of the opinion that
                            expression of the regrets of Admiral Yarnell, if authorized by him,
                            would more appropriately have been made by an American naval
                            officer.</p>

                        <p>380. Department’s 218, July 26, 6 p.m. Besides daily conferences with
                            Admiral Le Breton, I have weekly conferences attended by staffs of the
                            Embassy and Consulate General and Admiral and his staff. We exchange
                            information and daily discuss these matters. I have not been in the
                            habit of discussing these matters of cooperation and coordination with
                            my diplomatic colleagues as I have, as has been customary, [apparently
                            garbled] accompanying with the Admiral who is in daily contact with the
                            British Admiral and when necessary with senior officer commanding two
                            French gunboats on the river at Hankow. The French gunboats are tied up
                            here at Hankow off the French concession and will be entirely concerned
                            with the protection of that concession.</p>
                        <p>There are five American gunboats on the river. The <hi rend="italic"
                                >Oahu</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> are now in the
                            Japanese occupied section. At Hankow at the present time there are the
                                <hi rend="italic">Luzon</hi>, flagship of the Admiral, and the <hi
                                rend="italic">Guam</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tutuila</hi>. I expect
                            to board the <hi rend="italic">Tutuila</hi> on August 2 with my staff
                            and proceed to Chungking. This will leave two gunboats, the <hi
                                rend="italic">Luzon</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Guam</hi>, here
                            at Hankow. They will remain at Hankow to cooperate with the Consulate
                            General in giving such protection as may be possible to American
                            citizens if and when the Japanese approach Hankow.</p>
                        <p>I have every confidence in the judgment of Admiral Le Breton. I am
                            certain that he shares with the Department and myself a keen desire to
                            see that his vessels perform their missions here on the river as
                            effectively as possible while at the same time avoiding undue risks. I
                            know that he and the officers under his command are constantly mindful
                            of this. At the same time we are also mindful of the fact that there is
                            nothing that we can do to protect ourselves from a deliberate attack
                            such as was made upon the <hi rend="italic">Panay</hi> nor from
                            accident. Every time there is an air raid here at Hankow there is always
                            the possibility of an accident from bombs dropped from the heights at
                            which the planes fly. We feel safe, however, under all ordinary
                            conditions <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0166"/>knowing that neither
                            Japanese nor Chinese want to attack us and that they will be on the
                            lookout for us if continually made aware of our presence. The Navy is in
                            daily contact with the Japanese Navy at Shanghai.</p>
                        <p>Repeated to Shanghai. Shanghai please repeat to Tokyo.</p>

                                to give the other three assurances enumerated in the first paragraph
                                of his telegram under reference, provided he had for that action the
                                approval of the senior American naval officer present. The
                                Department also notes with satisfaction that the consul was able
                                apparently to settle the incident of July 22 locally upon
                                satisfactory <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0167"/>terms. There
                                appears no indication in the consul’s telegram of when he became
                                aware of the incident that occurred on July 20 at 9 p.m., and the
                                Department is confident that the consul has in mind the importance,
                                under existing circumstances, of reporting as promptly as possible
                                incidents involving Americans and Japanese in China.</item>

                        <p>0029. [For the Ambassador in China:] Reference recent incidents at
                            Chefoo, consider it most desirable that minor affairs be settled locally
                            as far as possible. Commander Japanese naval landing party and Jap
                            Consul have been most reasonable, show great desire to maintain friendly
                            relations and settle differences locally. Believe that if every incident
                            must be referred elsewhere for settlement these two officials will
                            change attitude and make situation more difficult. Incident of brawl
                            between enlisted men and local police was settled by Consul on my
                            recommendation. Consider our Consul and our senior naval officer Captain
                            Carroll both men of sound judgment, capable of handling all minor
                            matters. Do not anticipate any further difficulties at Chefoo.</p>

                        <p>391. Department’s 214, July 24, 1 p.m. Kiukiang was occupied by Japanese
                            forces on July 26. Commanding officer of U. S. S. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Monocacy</hi> on July 30 called on senior Japanese naval officer in
                            presence of Japanese Consul and informed him that on August 1 he desired
                            to make contact with American nationals in the city of Kiukiang and
                            stated that he intended to move <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> back to
                            the installation of the Standard Oil Company. He was told that he could
                            do none of these things for the present as war zone extended from Hukow
                            to Kiukiang and that area off installation was dangerous due to the
                            presence of mines. Commander of <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> stated
                            that he desired to move to installation as being farther from war zone
                            than his present position. The senior naval officer maintained that
                            heavy guerrilla fighting continues about city and asked that <hi
                                rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> not move until word had been received
                            from higher Japanese naval authorities.</p>
                        <p>It is not mandatory that <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> move. <hi
                                rend="italic">Monocacy</hi>, however, should be free to make contact
                            with Americans and with American property.</p>
                        <p>On July 31 commanding officer of <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> received
                            a letter from the senior Japanese naval officer stating that the
                            military authorities in Kiukiang do not agree to his proposal for
                            sending an officer into the city to make contact with American nationals
                            nor does the higher naval authority at Nanking agree to the moving of
                            the <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> and the equipment of the Standard
                            Oil Company to the installation of the Standard Oil Company.</p>
                        <p>We have had no certain information regarding the welfare of American
                            citizens in the city of Kiukiang since the Japanese occupied the city.
                            Does the Department desire that Commander of <hi rend="italic"
                                >Monocacy</hi> continue to discuss matter with senior Japanese naval
                            officer or would it prefer take matter up in Tokyo on the ground that
                            refusal to permit American Navy access to American nationals and to
                            American property is an unjustified interference with our rights on the

                            Large, reading as follows: <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0172"/>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>2. “I have the honor to state that I am informed by the Japanese
                                    naval authorities that the Chinese are using steam launches and
                                    junks in their hostile operations, such as laying mines, on the
                                    Yangtze between Kiukiang and Hankow, and that many a vessel
                                    flying a third power flag has been noticed operating in a
                                    suspicious manner in the immediate vicinity of the mine-laid
                                    area.</p>
                                <p>It is inconceivable that any third power vessel engaged in a
                                    peaceful trade should venture to be in such a dangerous place,
                                    and those vessels flying third power flags are considered to be
                                    Chinese military ships disguised as foreign ships for the
                                    purpose of evading attack from the Japanese forces.</p>
                                <p>It is to be recalled that the Japanese Navy, being anxious to
                                    avoid any possible mistake, requested on the 11th June to be
                                    kept informed of the whereabouts of each vessel, both naval and
                                    mercantile, of a third power, in the abovementioned region. When
                                    a small vessel is flying a third power flag and operating in a
                                    suspicious manner near the mine-laid area, it is almost
                                    impossible to ascertain its nationality from an aeroplane, and
                                    the sole means of distinguishing a neutral vessel from an enemy
                                    vessel is the notification by the former of its whereabouts.</p>
                                <p>I have, therefore, to request Your Excellency to be good enough
                                    to take the necessary steps in order that the American naval
                                    authorities may keep close contact with the Japanese Navy and
                                    notify it without delay of the whereabouts of each and every
                                    vessel, both naval and mercantile.</p>
                                <p>I wish to add that it is deemed desirable that a third power
                                    vessel which is so small that it is difficult to ascertain its
                                    nationality should refrain from entering the zone of activities
                                    of the Chinese forces.”</p>

                        <p>According to a telegram from the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic">Oahu</hi> to
                            the Commander-in-Chief, the Japanese Admiral Oikawa has referred to his
                            notice of July 8 (see Shanghai’s 969, July 9, 2 p.m., which was repeated
                            to you, especially numbered paragraph 3), and it would appear that the
                            position of the Japanese authorities in regard to the right of foreign
                            ships to traverse this section of the river is that having themselves
                            cut a passage through the boom at Matang, the Japanese authorities have
                            a right to close that passage to foreign vessels. This Government of
                            course cannot admit any such right or the validity of the basis invoked
                            in support of that asserted right.</p>
                        <p>Please urgently approach the Foreign Office in regard to this matter and
                            ask that prompt instructions be given by the Japanese Government to the
                            end that the opposition of the Japanese military authorities to the
                            proposed passage of the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> be
                            withdrawn and appropriate facilities be extended the vessel in
                            connection with its movement through the passage. In your approach it is
                            suggested that you emphasize that this Government has been endeavoring
                            to pursue a course which takes full cognizance of the fact that
                            hostilities are in progress and which shall be in accordance with the
                            principles of reason; that in pursuance of this course wherever possible
                            we have informed both the Japanese and the Chinese authorities of the
                            movements of our vessels and our vessels have sought to avoid being in
                            areas where hostilities are in progress; and that in view of the course
                            which we have consistently followed we feel that the Japanese
                            authorities in their turn should meet our wishes, which are based on
                            substantial reasons, in regard to this matter.</p>

                            taken by the Embassy and of the procedure which you have in mind. In the
                            event that it becomes necessary for you to take the case up with the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs it is suggested that, in addition to
                            emphasizing the points outlined in the last paragraph of the
                            Department’s previous telegram, you emphasize also the substantial
                            reasons, as indicated by the Commander-in-Chief, for the <hi

                        <p>545. Department’s 290, August 16, 6 p.m.</p>
                        <p>1. Our informal efforts to obtain authority for the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Monocacy</hi> to proceed to Shanghai have proved abortive. We were
                            advised that while our representations would be communicated to Admiral
                            Oikawa, it is not the intention of the Japanese Government to intervene
                            in the exercise by Admiral Oikawa of the discretionary powers vested in
                            him.</p>
                        <p>2. I therefore took up the case this afternoon directly with the Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs and made strong oral representations, basing my
                            approach upon (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) practical considerations and
                                (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) legitimate rights, and emphasizing the
                            various points set forth by the Department and by the American
                            Commander-in-Chief. I furthermore pointed out that this question is one
                            of the utmost delicacy which deserves to receive the most careful
                            consideration of the Japanese <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0175"
                            />Government and that I could not believe that the Japanese Government
                            would leave entirely to the discretion of one of its subordinate
                            officers the decision in a matter involving one of the primary rights of
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>3. General Ugaki said in reply that the Japanese Government sincerely
                            appreciated the courses which the American Government has followed
                            during the hostilities in China. He did not think that he could
                            subscribe to our argument that section of the Yangtze under discussion
                            is at present a public waterway because the Japanese have made great
                            sacrifices in opening the boom at Matang simply for military purposes
                            and their standpoint is in their opinion one of pure logic.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then said that after our initial representations the
                            Japanese Government had immediately consulted Admiral Oikawa and was now
                            in receipt of his reply which could be summarized as follows: (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) The necessity of military operations render
                            compliance with our request difficult at the present time but every
                            effort will be made to comply at the earliest possible moment; (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) the Japanese Navy, on request from us, will be
                            glad to cooperate by furnishing Japanese vessels or, if necessary,
                            planes for the supply or transportation of provisions or fuel for the
                                <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> and for the transportation of mails
                            or personnel.</p>
                        <p>4. I reemphasized the importance of principle at issue and said that
                            while I would promptly report to my Government the Minister’s reply I
                            could not predict the attitude either of my Government or of the
                            American Commander-in-Chief.</p>
                        <p>5. I interpret this as a categorical refusal and while fully appreciating
                            the seriousness of the issue here involved I think that there can be no
                            doubt but that we have exhausted diplomatic resources.</p>

                                    his desire to cooperate to the limit of his ability short of
                                    giving his consent to <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> passage
                                    which must be withheld for time being because of undisclosable

                                    that the “situation would be less formidable” were American and
                                    Japanese interests the only ones at stake. Suggested Japanese

                                    unfavorably received. Oikawa also assures that present refusal
                                    is not to be interpreted as implying permanent control of
                                    Yangtze by Japanese but refuses to predict any date for

                        <p>0021. Inform Admiral Oikawa that his message transmitted by Commander
                            Takata has been given earnest consideration. No restriction on the
                            primary right of American vessels to navigate any part of the Yangtze
                            River as may be necessary to safeguard our interests or nationals can be
                            accepted. On the other hand the navigational difficulties now existing
                            temporarily below Kiukiang are recognized. It is my intention and desire
                            to refrain in every way from action that will embarrass Admiral Oikawa.
                            To that end the sailing of the <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> will be
                            delayed until later date. Extend to Admiral Oikawa my appreciation for
                            his earnest desire and efforts to arrive at a satisfactory solution.

                                also was refused”; that “It was reported that American naval

                                Japanese refusal and considered the situation sufficiently serious
                                to refer it to the State Department at Washington”; that “A decision
                                which might involve a serious diplomatic situation has been deferred
                                only because the <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> has fuel and

                                long there might be the most important showdown of the Chinese war
                                between the Japanese and American Governments”.</item>

                        <p>1156. 1. I read to the United Press representative, Mr. Bellaire, today
                            paragraphs 1 and 2 of your 499, August 22, 2 p.m. I brought forcibly to
                            Bellaire’s attention the harm that such news despatches do and I asked
                            him specifically for source of his statement that “diplomatic quarters
                            predicted freely that before long there might be a most extraordinary
                            showdown of the Chinese war between the Japanese and American
                            Governments”. Mr. Bellaire said that the source of this information was
                            the British Embassy. I will endeavor to check further on this phase of
                            the matter.</p>
                        <p>2. Bellaire was extremely apologetic and assured me that there would be
                            no recurrence of matters of this kind which might embarass the
                            Department or the Consulate General. He stated emphatically that none of
                            the information came from any members of this Consulate General or from
                            American naval personnel in Shanghai and he also stated, and submitted
                            satisfactory evidence to support the statement, that his despatch was
                            largely rewritten in the New York office of the Associated [<hi
                                rend="italic">United</hi>] Press and that many of the quotations in
                            the first half of the telegram under reference were not included in his
                            telegraphic report from Shanghai. Except for the reference to
                            “diplomatic quarters” it seems evident to me, on the strength of my
                            investigation, that the press despatch of August 22 from Shanghai was
                            principally a rewrite in New York.</p>
                        <p>3. Bellaire informed me that his first intimation of the story regarding
                            the <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> reached him from his New York
                            office. Victor <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0181"/>Keen of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Herald Tribune</hi> at Hankow had reported that the
                            Japanese had refused Admiral Yarnell’s request in connection with the
                            movement of the <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi>.</p>
                        <p>4. This Consulate General does in fact endeavor to maintain effective
                            cooperation with press correspondents but it is difficult, as I know the
                            Department realizes, to prevent situations such as that described in
                            your [<hi rend="italic">the</hi>] telegram under reference from you.</p>

                        <p>Under date August 29 Admiral Yarnell telegraphed the Navy Department as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Before informing Jap Admiral that <hi rend="italic"

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Some two weeks ago Mr. Grew at Tokyo made strong oral representations to
                            the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs to the end that the Japanese
                            Government withdraw its objections to the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Monocacy</hi> proceeding to Shanghai. (The <hi rend="italic"
                                >Monocacy</hi> desired to proceed to Shanghai because of shortage of
                            fuel and provisions and for the relief of personnel.) The Japanese
                            Government declined to withdraw <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0183"
                            />its objections because of important military and tactical
                            considerations; stated that every effort would be made to do so at the
                            earliest possible moment; and offered, on request, to furnish Japanese
                            vessels for the supply or transportation of provisions or fuel and for
                            the transportation of mails or personnel. Mr. Grew interpreted the
                            Japanese reply as a categorical refusal and said that in his opinion we
                            had exhausted diplomatic resources.</p>
                        <p>On being informed of the Japanese Government’s attitude, Admiral Yarnell
                            telegraphed the Navy Department proposing that he reply to the Japanese
                            Admiral that while we could not relinquish any right of free navigation
                            on the Yangtze River he was prepared, in view of the navigational
                            difficulties now existing temporarily below Kiukiang, to delay the
                            sailing of the <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi>. Admiral Yarnell stated
                            that, inasmuch as he lacked any information of military operations now
                            taking place near the Matang boom and conditions in the river, he
                            considered it advisable to retain the <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> at
                            Kiukiang until Japanese cooperation for her passage down the river is
                            obtained. Admiral Yarnell pointed out that a factor in the situation was
                            the aid which might be rendered by the <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi>
                            to American nationals now at Kuling. Admiral Yarnell also proposed that
                            he accept the Japanese offer for transportation of fuel, provisions and
                            personnel. The Navy Department approved Admiral Yarnell’s recommendation
                            except for the acceptance of offer of transportation of fuel and
                            provisions from the Japanese which was not approved at that time.</p>
                        <p>It is to be noted that the British also have a gunboat at Kiukiang; that
                            the British have not taken up at Tokyo the question of the British
                            gunboat proceeding to Shanghai; and that so far as we know the British
                            gunboat will remain at Kiukiang.</p>
                        <p>It is our belief that the Japanese will continue to object to the <hi
                                rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> proceeding down the river to Shanghai.
                            Admiral Yarnell has no information in regard to the situation near the
                            Matang boom. Should the <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> decide to
                            proceed down river in face of Japanese objections, the Japanese could
                            easily prevent the passage of the <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi>
                            through the boom. A Japanese pilot might be needed for pilotage through
                            the boom. There would also be danger from mines.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, we do not believe that the issue or issues
                            involved warrant (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) insistence on our part that
                            the Japanese withdraw their objections or (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the
                            sailing of the vessel in the face of Japanese objections. Moreover, in
                            view of the fact that we believe that a further approach to the Japanese
                            would be unsuccessful, we suggest that no such further approach be made.
                            Also, if by the time the <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> has exhausted
                            its supply of fuel and provisions the situation on the river remains
                            unchanged, we suggest that Admiral Yarnell’s recommendation that he
                            accept the Japanese offer for transportation of fuel and provisions be
                            approved.</p>

                                    could not inconvenience operations. Also inform him the <hi

                                    message of yesterday through Commander Takata and Mr. Mizota.
                                    The Japanese Admiral is anxious that you more fully understand
                                    his position and states therefore that he is impelled to
                                    disclose information most of which he considers most secret and
                                    requests precautions be taken to prevent leaks to Chinese or
                                    third powers. Have swept only narrow channel between Wuhu and
                                    point 15 miles above Kiukiang, more than 700 mines destroyed and
                                    numerous casualties sustained by their ships; Rear Admiral
                                    Sonoda is now in charge of sweeping operations, on 31 August
                                    will commence new sweeping operations from Wuhu up, but will not
                                    even reach Anking by 10 September. Below Kiukiang and at <pb

                                    on charts Chinese detached units very active, necessary above
                                    Wuhu that all ships proceed in convoys with destroyer escort,
                                    all convoys subject sniping and indirect fire of Chinese field
                                    and heavy artillery located inland from river. Congestion in
                                    river caused by operation of hundreds of large ships and
                                    thousands of small craft above Wuhu, presents serious problem
                                    which would be complicated by passage even small gunboat. In
                                    addition, passage down of <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> would
                                    undoubtedly be followed by similar British demands for <hi

                                    increase difficulties; states his belief Japanese foreign office
                                    has never questioned fundamental right third powers to free
                                    navigation of Yangtze but Jap navy does claim control passage
                                    through barriers by virtue their capture and military nature.
                                    Present objections hinge on military and naval operations and
                                    expediency; states belief British have recognized validity

                                    he was ignorant of this until yesterday. Military refusal based
                                    on fear of disclosure Japanese efforts to recondition former
                                    Chinese air field near that plant for their own use. Even though
                                    field not visible from company plant, operations connected
                                    therewith are. Military commander instructed to permit U. S. S.

                                    steam down river. Admiral Oikawa therefore again requests that

                                    Kiukiang until such time as present objections no longer

                                <p>Comdr. Takata and Mr. Mizota request that unless it is desired to
                                    have Admiral Oikawa personally present that arrangements be made
                                    to conduct future interviews at Jap naval headquarters in
                                    Shanghai or some other mutually agreeable meeting place in that
                                    city because of greater convenience; they both propose to return

                        <p>Commander Shelley of the Navy Department telephoned me about this series
                            of messages.<note n="40" xml:id="d217fn40"><hi rend="italic"
                                >Supra</hi>.</note> He said that with reference to the last message,
                            the feeling in the Navy Department was that the Navy Department would
                            send no reply to Admiral Yarnell: in other words, the Navy Department
                            would leave Admiral Yarnell free to accept the Japanese offer to
                            transport mail, supplies, and possibly personnel. Commander Shelley said
                            that Admiral Leahy was not at the Navy Department today, but that the
                            foregoing represented the opinion of the officers at the Navy Department
                            who had considered the matter. I said that if the Navy Department wished
                            to handle the matter by making no reply to Admiral Yarnell, we would not
                            wish to interpose in the matter and the Navy Department’s decision was
                            satisfactory to us. I added that decision along the lines indicated by
                            the Navy Department seemed to us to be essentially a matter for the Navy
                            Department.</p>

                            property with my British and French colleagues and we feel that subject
                            is bound up with the general question of return of Whangpoo Conservancy
                            equipment and operation to control of Conservancy Board, upon which
                            subject American, British and French Ambassadors at Tokyo made
                            representations to the Japanese Foreign Office on August 29 (see Tokyo’s

                            However, when I next see my Japanese colleague, which will probably be
                            within a few days, I will bring up matter, but it is doubtful whether
                            the military will yield in the slightest as this property is in the zone
                            which it is undoubtedly the intention of the Japanese authorities to
                            convert into a military base or an area for other military purposes, or
                            at least to make it a part of extensive Japanese wharfage
                            facilities.</p>

                        <p>1225. My 900, June 25, 10 a.m., Department’s 407, July [<hi rend="italic"
                                >June</hi>] 29, 3 p.m., my 1152, August 22, 7 p.m. and Department’s
                            August 24, 4 p.m. Morishima, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, has
                            orally informed me that the Japanese Government is anxious to settle the
                            Whangpoo Conservancy matter and believes that it can be settled on the
                            basis of a Japanese co-engineer-in-chief with the appointment of four or
                            five other minor officials or employees, together with a Japanese
                            liaison officer between the Japanese authorities and the Conservancy
                            Board. Morishima states that the proposal does not contemplate the
                            removal of the present Chinese engineer-in-chief who, Morishima
                            believes, will be willing to continue in his present position as a
                            co-engineer-in-chief.</p>
                        <p>This tentative problem [<hi rend="italic">proposal</hi>] [is] largely due
                            [to] recession from the original stand taken by the Japanese but a
                            conversation which I had with the British Chargé d’Affaires and with the
                            British Consulate today leads me to believe that the fresh proposal
                            might not be acceptable to them. The American Minister [<hi
                                rend="italic">Ambassador</hi>] expressed the view that the
                            interested powers should press for the return of all Conservancy
                            equipment and property to its pre-hostilities status and that the fresh
                            proposals now made by Morishima should be accepted only as a last
                            resort. I have not committed the Consulate General to the acceptance of
                            a Japanese co-engineer-in-chief but I believe that if the Whangpoo
                            Conservancy right of way operations are to be resumed in the reasonably
                            near future it may be found necessary to make some concession on the
                            basis of expediency and preservation of an indispensable waterway. I
                            believe, however, that before this is done the concerned Ambassadors at
                            Tokyo should make further representations to the Foreign Office but
                            their [representations?] should be somewhat more emphatic than those

                            colleague and I agree that the Japanese proposal that the negotiations
                            be continued at Shanghai should be taken up because (<hi rend="italic"

                                requested by the Japanese naval authorities to transmit to Your

                                <p>“(1) It is a matter for gratification that owing to the
                                    wholehearted and sympathetic cooperation given by third power
                                    authorities in complying <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0190"
                                    />with the request made to them by the Commander-in-Chief of the
                                    Imperial Japanese Fleet on June 11 and June 8 relative to the
                                    movements of neutral vessels on the Yangtze River, there has
                                    arisen no untoward question in the zone of hostilities above
                                    Wuhu such as might impair friendly relations with any third
                                    power. For the friendly consideration and understanding thus
                                    shown by the various powers, the Commander-in-Chief is deeply
                                    grateful.</p>
                                <p>(2) Although the number of mines already destroyed by the
                                    Japanese fleet units in their military operations on the Yangtze
                                    far exceeds 1,000, even greater efforts must be made to remove
                                    the danger from this source as the season of receding water of
                                    the Yangtze approaches. There is also the danger from the
                                    activities of Chinese soldiers along the bank, whose attacks are
                                    directed for the most part against hospital ships and unarmed
                                    transports. The greatest tactical difficulty our fleet has
                                    encountered in its efforts to eliminate the danger from such
                                    attacks of the enemy along the bank has been the necessity of
                                    ascertaining, before launching an attack, whether there was not
                                    some neutral vessels or buildings located in close proximity to
                                    the enemy’s position,—a necessity which has not infrequently
                                    caused us to miss the most opportune moment for the attack.</p>
                                <p>The zone of intensive fighting, which we intimated in our earlier
                                    communication has been in the Yangtze basin below Hwangshihkang,
                                    has now moved upstream to the region between Hwangshihkang and
                                    Hankow and its vicinity. Desiring to avoid the occurrence of any
                                    unpleasant and mutually regrettable incident, we beg to request
                                    the powers concerned, with due consideration to the position of
                                    the Imperial Japanese fleet, to cause their respective vessels
                                    to seek refuge upstream from Hankow and to take such measures as
                                    may be necessary to prevent the use of any buildings belonging
                                    to their respective nationalities, as well as areas immediately
                                    adjacent to such buildings, by the Chinese for military
                                    purposes.</p>
                                <p>(3) Although, with regard to the misuse of third power
                                    [property?] as above set forth by the Chinese in ways calculated
                                    to give rise to needless questions which it is the desire of the
                                    third powers and Japan alike to avoid, we requested the powers
                                    concerned on an earlier occasion to vigorously protest against
                                    such misuse by the Chinese, it has become apparent to us that
                                    the Chinese are now even more unscrupulous than before in this
                                    nefarious practice. It is therefore hoped that the powers
                                    concerned will give this matter their further consideration. It
                                    is the intention of the Imperial Japanese fleet authorities to
                                    treat as Chinese property, in accordance with the law, any
                                    property such as wharves, hulks, et cetera, whenever it appears
                                    to us manifest that the Chinese have hoisted a third power flag
                                    over a property which is not completely neutral property.</p>
                                <p>(4) Appreciation has already been expressed of the steps taken by
                                    the Standard Oil Company to comply with our request regarding
                                    measures to be taken to render neutral ships easily
                                    recognizable. We are grateful also to the British naval
                                    authorities for the step they have since taken to paint the
                                    awnings of their gunboats on the Yangtze in special colors
                                    which, according to the experience of our air units, have
                                    rendered those vessels more distinguishable than before. And to
                                    the authorities of the other powers concerned, we desire to ask
                                    that the undertaking of the Imperial Japanese fleet that the
                                    flag <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0191"/>painted on the
                                    awning is not, by itself, adequate for the purpose be given
                                    their sympathetic reconsideration, and to reiterate the request
                                    that some suitable way be devised.</p>
                                <p>(5) The Chinese have constructed two additional booms, one below
                                    Shihhweiyao and another above it, thereby stopping all river
                                    traffic at those points. Although a passage necessary for
                                    military purposes will be opened through these booms as soon as
                                    they have fallen into our hands, such openings, as in the case
                                    of the Matang boom, cannot be made available for use by any
                                    vessels other than our naval vessels and military transports
                                    until such time as the Commander-in-Chief considers that the
                                    operations of the Japanese forces will no longer be hampered
                                    thereby.</p>
                                <p>(6) The Japanese authorities greatly appreciate the information
                                    which the various powers have hitherto given regarding the
                                    location and movements of their vessels on the Yangtze above
                                    Kiukiang. And now that the hostilities are progressing into the
                                    vicinity of Hankow, it is hoped that the powers which have not
                                    before given us such information in detail will do so.</p>
                                <p>It is requested that liaison with the Imperial Japanese naval
                                    authorities be maintained, as heretofore, through the naval
                                    representatives stationed at Shanghai.”</p>

                        <p>497. Shanghai’s 1344, October 17, 6 p.m. Does Department have any
                            specific instructions to give me as to reply other than an
                            acknowledgment and a statement to the effect that while reserving our
                            rights I have communicated its contents to the Commander-in-Chief. I
                            propose to leave to the discretion of the Navy the matter of the
                            disposal of the two vessels now at Hankow under Admiral Le Breton. With
                            reference to the matter of the use of buildings or areas adjacent
                            thereto by the defensive activities of the Chinese, I would like to
                            report to Tani what has been said by the Embassy at Tokyo as reported in
                            Tokyo’s 671, October 16, 3 p.m.<note n="48" xml:id="d226fn48"><ref

                            serious attention to the contentions made in paragraph 5 of the
                            memorandum enclosed with Tani’s communication as indicating quite
                            clearly the fundamental intention of the Japanese to close the river to
                            all foreign shipping and traffic indefinitely at Shanghai [<hi
                                rend="italic">sic</hi>] until the Japanese have arranged to
                            monopolize traffic in their own interest. It may also be expected that
                            with the crystallizing of the Canton–Kowloon Railway and the blocking of
                            the Pearl River the Japanese will cut Hong Kong completely off from all
                            contact with the Chinese mainland in a similar way and that we may
                            expect to see the Japanese complete the port that the Chinese were
                            interested in building at Whampoa and controlling that port as a
                            [deep-sea] port for Canton to the exclusion of Hong Kong. These
                            situations may, I am convinced, be expected to influence British
                            attitude toward Japan’s position in China.</p>

                                    been requested by the Japanese naval authorities to transmit to

                                <p>“(1) The whole of the region traversed by the Pearl River
                                    becoming a zone of intense fighting from today as a result of
                                    the irresistible march of the Japanese forces upon Canton, the
                                    third powers whose naval vessels and merchant men are now
                                    located on the Pearl River or on the waters adjacent thereto are
                                    hereby requested to take steps to have such ships take refuge in
                                    the open or in the upper reaches of the Pearl River far removed

                                <p>(2) It is hoped that the third powers concerned will inform the
                                    Japanese naval authorities as soon as possible of the location
                                    and movements of their naval vessels and merchant men on the
                                    Pearl River and adjacent waters.</p>

                                    to render them easily distinguishable by our air, naval and land
                                    forces.</p>
                                <p>(3) Upon capture of the boom which the Chinese have constructed
                                    across the Pearl River, the Japanese naval force will open
                                    through the said boom a passage necessary for our military
                                    operations. And we trust it may be understood that this passage,
                                    as in the case of the Matang boom on the Yangtze, cannot be made
                                    available to any ships other than those serving the military
                                    needs of the Japanese forces until such time as the
                                    Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese fleet considers that the use
                                    of this passage by other ships will no longer interfere with our
                                    military operations.</p>
                                <p>(4) The above requests being actuated by the earnest desire of
                                    the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese fleet to avoid the
                                    occurrence of any unpleasant incident involving the third
                                    power[s], it is hoped that all the third powers concerned will
                                    give us their sincere cooperation toward the attainment of the
                                    end envisaged. 22 October, 1938.”</p>

                        <p>687. 1. With reference to a memorandum said to have been submitted by the
                            Japanese naval authorities in Hankow through the Japanese Minister in
                            Shanghai requesting third powers speedily to move their vessels to
                            previously specified anchorage in order to avoid unfortunate incidents
                            by reason of their proximity to numerous junks with China troops aboard
                            stated to be swarming in vicinity of neutral vessels anchored along the
                            Hankow water front, my British colleague has today addressed the
                            following letter to the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I have just received a telegram from the British Embassy in
                                    Shanghai, of which the substance is given in the enclosed
                                    document. Although I have not yet received official instructions
                                    in the matter, I think it only right to let you know without
                                    further delay that we must take the strongest possible exception
                                    to the communication stated to have been made in Shanghai by the
                                    Japanese naval authorities. The position of British vessels
                                    anchored along the water front in Hankow is fully known to the
                                    Japanese authorities, the vessels are adequately marked and, so
                                    long as there are British interests to be protected, British
                                    gunboats must remain there for the purpose. It would, in the
                                    circumstance, be entirely unwarranted for any further attacks to
                                    be made in the immediate neighborhood of any British vessels. As
                                    regards the reference to the ‘intensive character of the
                                    hostilities’, this was no doubt written before it was known that
                                    the Chinese Government would not defend the city of Hankow
                                    itself.</p>
                                <p>I think it only right to warn the Japanese Government, through
                                    Your Excellency, of the serious consequences which must, I fear,
                                    follow from any further attacks delivered in close proximity to
                                    British vessels on the Yangtze and I trust that the most
                                    explicit instructions will be sufficient [<hi rend="italic"
                                        >sent?</hi>] to the proper naval authorities to abstain from
                                    such action.”</p>

                        <p>2. Craigie has this moment written me “Perhaps you may see your way clear
                            to making similar representations against an apparent intention <pb

                            Shanghai with regard to this matter, I hesitate to act without
                            authorization but a brief flash from the Department would ensure action
                            tomorrow morning. The attitude of our Government concerning the safety
                            of our vessels on the Yangtze has already been made perfectly clear to
                            the Japanese Government. Naval Attaché concurs.</p>

                            indicative of an unreasonable attitude on the part of the Japanese

                        <p>39. In an interview with press representatives yesterday the Japanese
                            Consul General is reported to have said that the situation with regard
                            to the Pearl River would be the same as that on the Yangtze; no foreign
                            vessels would be permitted to proceed to or from Hong Kong for a number
                            of weeks but Japanese vessels would soon bring in cargoes of foodstuffs
                            and supplies. When foreigners did go out to Hong Kong they would
                            probably not be permitted to return. He added that the Japanese would
                            not hinder the establishment of a local government by the Chinese but
                            would prefer that the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> (with the
                            Japanese military in power) should continue for the present.</p>
                        <p>There have been movements of Japanese troops the past 2 days northward,
                            of [<hi rend="italic">on?</hi>] the Canton-Hankow Bailroad, and south
                            toward Samshui. Apparently defenses against guerrilla attacks are being
                                <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0199"/>constructed all around
                            Canton and sandbag defenses are placed in the streets at the posts
                            occupied by guard units.</p>
                        <p>Please inform Mrs. C. J. Armentrout, Warrensburg, Missouri, her daughter
                            Lois is well and safe.</p>

                        <p>373. 1. The Department believes that the time has come for this
                            Government to take up with the Japanese Government the whole broad
                            question of freedom of navigation on the Yangtze River. This question,
                            in so far as navigation on the lower Yangtze is concerned, was referred
                            to in your note of October 6 to the Japanese Government<note n="56"
                                xml:id="d236fn56"><ref target="frus1931-41v01#pg_785"><hi

                                        <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 785</ref>.</note> on the
                            subject of the Open Door. Japanese armed forces have now advanced up the
                            Yangtze River to Hankow and there are no longer major hostilities on the
                            river or along the banks of the river below Hankow. Japanese ships in
                            large numbers have proceeded up the river to Hankow and there were
                            present at Hankow on October 31 according to this Government’s
                            information 2 mine layers, 3 gunboats, 3 torpedo boats, 2 mine sweepers,
                            2 auxiliaries, 23 transports, 12 tugs, 2 tankers, 20 supply ships, 1
                            hospital ship and approximately 600 small craft. Moreover, Japanese
                            armed forces, following their arrival at Hankow, have had ample time in
                            which to systematize the movement of Japanese national vessel on the
                            river.</p>
                        <p>While active hostilities were taking place on sections of the Yangtze
                            River below Hankow, we refrained from exercising our right to freedom of
                            navigation of the river. We now consider that it is only reasonable that
                            the Japanese Government should no longer place obstacles in the way of
                            the exercise of this American right. The Yangtze River is the main
                            artery of communication in central China. It is a highly important
                            channel for the movement of persons, goods, and vessels. It is a river
                            of width sufficient to take care of the traffic needs of all concerned.
                            Under present circumstances this Government perceives no reasonable
                            basis in support of restriction by the Japanese Government of the free
                            use of this river.</p>
                        <p>2. The Department desires that you take this matter up vigorously and in
                            person at the earliest opportune moment with the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs along the general lines indicated above. The question whether
                            your presentation should be by formal note or orally <pb n="196"
                                xml:id="pg_196" facs="0200"/>is left to your discretion. If the
                            presentation is oral, please leave with the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            an informal memorandum as record of what you say. This Government will
                            not be satisfied with a reply of an indefinite character and you should
                            press for a favorable reply which will include the naming of an early
                            date after which the Japanese Government will place no obstacles in the

                        <p>The Consulate General this morning received the Japanese Embassy’s letter
                            GO 13, dated Shanghai November 2, addressed to the <pb n="197"
                                xml:id="pg_197" facs="0201"/>American Ambassador transmitting, at
                            the request of the Japanese naval authorities, the following memorandum:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“(1) During the campaign for the capture of Hankow, heavy
                                    fighting took place in the waters above Hankow up as far as the
                                    neighborhood of Changsha. Following the fall of that city, the
                                    upper Yangtze as far inland as Shasi and Changsha, as well as
                                    all of the waters adjacent thereto, has become the zone of
                                    hostilities. It being anticipated that intense fighting will
                                    take place in this zone, we desire to request that steps be
                                    taken to have all neutral vessels now in this zone take refuge
                                    as far upstream as possible.</p>
                                <p>(2) It is requested that information concerning the positions and
                                    movements of all neutral vessels now on the Yangtze above
                                    Hankow, as well as in the waters adjacent thereto be given
                                    through the Japanese senior naval officer stationed at
                                    Shanghai.</p>
                                <p>(3) While the hearty cooperation which certain powers have
                                    hitherto accorded us in our efforts to prevent the occurrence of
                                    incidents with third powers is deeply appreciated, it is
                                    earnestly hoped that those powers which have not heretofore
                                    informed us regarding their vessels will, in view of our
                                    frequent requests, give us closer cooperation in the future.</p>
                                <p>In the requests we have made in the past, information was asked
                                    concerning the positions of vessels ‘on the Yangtze above X
                                    point’. And in view of the fact that there is now no section of
                                    China over which Japanese planes can not operate, we desire to
                                    call attention to the fact that what has been desired is
                                    information of vessels in the ‘whole stretch of the river above
                                    X point’, irrespective of the distance at which such vessels are
                                    located.”</p>

                            night the Foreign Office sent word to Craigie to see Grew, get the gist
                            of his instructions and make similar representations. Craigie will
                            follow Grew’s lead as to whether they should be made in writing or
                            orally. They have also advised the French that they have so instructed

                            press reports from London indicating that parallel diplomatic protests
                            would be made by Great Britain, France and the United States against

                            Asiatic Petroleum Company. Previously this British firm had also been

                            <p>[“] Reply to the three notes says the same thing in different terms
                                and is of course unsatisfactory. Unless there is a fairly strong
                                reaction at home I fear that assurance in last paragraph in regard
                                to efforts to ensure relaxation of the restrictions will remain
                                illusory.</p>
                            <p>My United States colleague and I both think that matter should not be
                                left where it is. Perhaps best course would be for a short reply to
                                be returned by the three representatives along the following lines
                                but with differing phrases:</p>
                            <p>Our Governments have noted with regret that the Japanese Government
                                have not seen their way to comply with their reasonable request:
                                particularly so since they are unable to accept the contention of
                                the Japanese Government either that regular and advertised trade in
                                Japanese vessels is not proceeding at the present time both up and
                                down the Yangtze or that the exercise by foreign vessels of their
                                right to participate in this trade would interfere with the
                                operations now in course. As regards former point it might be
                                mentioned during the months of August and September no less than 70
                                cases were reliably reported in which ordinary commercial
                                merchandise was carried by Japanese merchant vessels trading up and
                                down the Yangtze. On latter point it might be observed that Yochow
                                which is now the lowest point on the Yangtze at which important
                                operations are proceeding is 120 miles above Hankow and 360 miles
                                above Wuhu and that particularly as regards the stretch between Wuhu
                                and Shanghai the arguments set forth in the Japanese note are
                                regarded as unacceptable. The three Governments take note of the
                                assurance in the last paragraph but consider that with every day’s
                                delay in rectifying the present state of affairs the seriousness of
                                this discrimination against foreign rights and interests is
                                intensified.</p>

                                <p>My Dear Ambassador: I have carefully perused the contents of Your
                                    Excellency’s letter, dated October 27, setting forth your views
                                    concerning the urgent request for the withdrawal of naval and
                                    other vessels of Your Excellency’s country from the vicinity of
                                    Hankow at the time of the attack on and capture of that place by
                                    the Japanese armed forces. The urgent request of the Japanese
                                    authorities concerned at Shanghai of which you refer was made in
                                    an effort to do everything possible to avert the occurrence of
                                    unforeseen damage to <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0207"

                                    on junks which were known definitely to the Japanese military
                                    authorities to have a large number of Chinese soldiers aboard
                                    and to be brazenly swarming in the proximity of naval and other
                                    vessels of third countries. This, just as prior announcements of
                                    the Imperial Government which have frequently been made, was an
                                    act based upon the sincere wish for the preservation of the
                                    rights and interests of third countries and should, I believe,

                        <p>390. Your 730, November 15, 8 p.m., freedom of navigation on Yangtze.</p>
                        <p>1. The Department approves your proposal to express orally to the Vice
                            Minister at a favorable opportunity surprise at the discourtesy of the
                            Foreign Office in giving to the press a summary of the Japanese note of
                            November 14<note n="71" xml:id="d248fn71"><ref

                                    795</ref>.</note> before the note had been delivered to you.</p>
                        <p>2. With regard to your recommendation that you address to the Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs a further note on the subject of freedom of
                            navigation on the Yangtze, the Department raises for your consideration
                            the question whether the likelihood of the Japanese Government taking a
                            favorable attitude would be improved by waiting for a short time, say
                            about 2 weeks, before addressing a further formal communication to the
                            Japanese Government. This interval would afford an opportunity to see
                            whether the Japanese Government in practice modifies its attitude and to
                            gather additional evidence in regard to the commercial use of the
                            Yangtze by the Japanese. In the meantime, an oral rejoinder might be
                            made promptly to the Japanese Foreign Office to the effect that the
                            reply of the Japanese Government is unsatisfactory to this Government
                            and that, while taking note of the assurance contained in the last
                            paragraph of the Japanese Government’s reply of November 14, your
                            Government considers that the seriousness of the present discrimination
                            against American rights and interests grows greater with each day’s
                            delay in correcting the <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0208"
                            />situation. Under this procedure, the question of making public the
                            texts of the communications exchanged would remain in abeyance.</p>
                        <p>The Department suggests that you discuss this procedure with your British
                            and French colleagues. Should all of you be in agreement in reference to
                            this procedure, you are authorized to proceed accordingly, it being
                            understood that each of the three Ambassadors would take similar but
                            separate action.</p>
                        <p>3. If, however, you and your colleagues are of the view that the
                            procedure suggested in your telegram under reference would offer greater
                            promise of favorable results, the Department authorizes you, if and when
                            your British and French colleagues are prepared to take substantially
                            similar but separate action, to communicate to the Japanese Foreign
                            Office, with the same degree of formality of approach used in the
                            presentation of your note of November 7,<note n="72" xml:id="d248fn72"

                            argumentation of the two intervening sentences should be omitted and be
                            reserved for possible future use.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the question of publicity, the Department offers for your
                            consideration the suggestion that you inform the Japanese Foreign Office
                            that, in view of the fact that the Foreign Office has already released
                            to the press the substance of the Japanese reply and in view of the
                            resulting comment and discussion which have already appeared in the
                            press in regard to this whole matter, we feel that the American public
                            should be given for its information the full texts of communications in
                            regard to this matter between the Embassy and the Japanese Foreign
                            Office.</p>
                        <p>If and when you make formal rejoinder to the Japanese Foreign Office,
                            please telegraph the Department the text thereof.</p>

                        <p>0129. Vice Admiral Oikawa, Commander-in-Chief Japanese naval forces in
                            China, delivered following memorandum dated 28 November at 1200 today:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“1. The Yangtze River was blockaded for military purposes by the
                                    Chiang Kai-shek Administration, but the booms were cut through
                                    by <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0210"/>the Japanese forces
                                    in order to carry out military operations. The military
                                    operations along the river and in the adjoining areas are still
                                    continued on a scale as large as heretofore.</p>
                                <p>2. Furthermore, the movement of Japanese war vessels and military
                                    transports up and down the river is still very frequent, while
                                    the necessity of keeping military secrets remains as great as
                                    heretofore. Moreover, the activities of Chinese irregulars on
                                    the river and along the banks are still unabated. The danger of
                                    mines and bullet or shell-fire still exists even below the
                                    Kiangyin boom, as is evidenced by the facts that the Japanese
                                    troops at Changkaikiang were fired upon from a ship on the river
                                    on October 24th while engaging guerillas on the other side, and
                                    that the <hi rend="italic">Tokusin Maru</hi>, a Japanese
                                    military transport, was attacked above Tungchow on November
                                    18th.</p>
                                <p>The Japanese forces are still engaged in destroying the Chinese
                                    forces along the river, in clearing or surveying the channels,
                                    and in setting up beacons. There has been no great change in the
                                    situation as far as the military operations along the Yangtze
                                    are concerned.</p>
                                <p>3. Therefore, as long as the Chiang Kai-shek Administration
                                    continues the warfare against Japan, considerable time will yet
                                    be required before the military operations along the Yangtze
                                    River can be ended and it is deemed appropriate for the
                                    navigation of third power vessels to be allowed.</p>
                                <p>4. Nevertheless, in view of the fact that a considerable time has
                                    elapsed since war vessels belonging to the Navy of your country
                                    were blocked up on the Yangtze by the Chinese forces and that
                                    these vessels may have been suffering from various
                                    inconveniences, I am ready to consider rendering, if you so
                                    desire, facilities for the navigation of only the warship, on
                                    the following conditions: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>Affirm. The navigation shall be effected solely on your
                                            own risk.</p>
                                        <p>Baker. Only the downriver navigation of the warship
                                            stationed on the Yangtze River between Wuhu and Yochow,
                                            and the upriver navigation of the relief warship not
                                            exceeding the original number of ships to be relieved at
                                            each station in the said area, shall be allowed.</p>
                                        <p>Cast. Downriver transportation of your nationals residing
                                            in the said area and transportation of foodstuffs by the
                                            warship navigation up or down the river in accordance
                                            with (Baker) shall be allowed.</p>
                                        <p>Dog. The navigation shall not hamper the Japanese
                                            military operations.</p>
                                        <p>Easy. In view of the fact that the mechanical mines in
                                            the Yangtze River are still dangerous to a considerable
                                            degree, and the important Japanese vessels are having
                                            their courses swept and being escorted, the warships of
                                            your Navy, when carrying out the above mentioned
                                            navigation, shall, in particular respects, be escorted
                                            and their course be swept by Japanese vessels, and they
                                            shall be conducted by Japanese vessels when crossing a
                                            boom or a defense net. The above facilities being to be
                                            afforded by the Japanese forces while they are engaged
                                            in active operations, and the capacity of the forces
                                            available being limited, the downriver navigation of the
                                            warships of your Navy and the despatch of the relief
                                            warships will have to be restricted to only once, and
                                            the downriver or upriver navigation of the warships of
                                            all the countries shall be effected in a group
                                            respectively. The date for the navigation will be fixed
                                            by consultation probably in the beginning of December.

                                            Japanese Navy do not mean to hold themselves responsible

                        <p>1478. On December 12, I requested the Acting Japanese Consul General to
                            arrange with the Japanese naval authorities for the Standard Vacuum Oil
                            Company’s motor vessel <hi rend="italic">Meiyun</hi> to proceed from
                            Kiukiang to Shanghai for much needed overhaul. I suggested that the <hi
                                rend="italic">Meiyun</hi> proceed down river with the U. S. S. <hi
                                rend="italic">Guam</hi> which is scheduled to leave Hankow for
                            Shanghai on or about December 19.</p>
                        <p>I have now been orally informed by the Japanese Consulate General that
                            the Japanese naval authorities state they are unable to grant permission
                            because similar requests made on behalf of British vessels have already
                            been refused. I am awaiting receipt of a written explanation but desire
                            to report this case as a particular instance of Japanese refusal to
                            permit navigation on the Yangtze by an American commercial vessel even
                            for the purpose of repairs and as a further instance of Japanese
                            interference with American rights.</p>

                            <item>Yesterday afternoon Kawahara of the Japanese Consulate and
                                Commander Mitunobu of the Japanese Naval Special Service Section
                                acknowledged and handed in a written reply to my request of December
                                12 which, after reciting the fact that arrangements made for foreign
                                naval vessels to proceed down river did not include commercial
                                vessels and that a similar request made in connection with a British
                                commercial vessel had been refused, concluded as follows: “I should
                                like to add that the Japanese naval authorities are considering the
                                possibility of arranging for the <hi rend="italic">Meiyun</hi> to
                                sail down the river in due course of time.”</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>In connection with the “possibility” referred to above, Commander
                                Mitunobu said they were anxious to make some special arrangement in
                                the case of the <hi rend="italic">Meiyun</hi> and he tentatively
                                suggested as a possible solution that the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Meiyun</hi> be chartered to the Japanese naval authorities for
                                a “short time” and then turned over to the Standard Vacuum Oil
                                Company at Shanghai. Mitunobu added charter fees would also be paid
                                to the company here. This suggestion has been communicated to the
                                Standard Vacuum Oil Company who state that they would be agreeable
                                to chartering the vessel only for the trip to Shanghai provided I do
                                not seriously object to such an arrangement.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>I do not look with much favor upon the chartering of an American
                                vessel to the Japanese naval authorities particularly as this
                                arrangement is an obvious usurpation. On the other hand I appreciate
                                the anxiety of the company to get the <hi rend="italic">Meiyun</hi>
                                to Shanghai. However, before taking any action I request the

                            funds contributed by Japanese for the purpose of expressing their
                            sympathy to the survivors of the <hi rend="italic">Panay</hi> disaster
                            may have your own direct consideration. The issue involved seems to me
                            of prime importance and I feel that much depends on the Department’s
                            favorable decision. Should these funds have to be returned to the
                            donors, the Embassy, through no fault of its own, would be placed in a
                            most difficult and embarrassing position and I fear that the resulting
                            reaction on Japanese public opinion owing to probably widespread
                            publicity, <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0214"/>would be very
                            unfortunate. I think that especially at this time of military
                            depredations we should do our best to retain the sympathy of the
                            Japanese public and that to return these donations to the contributors
                            would very likely cause resentment throughout the country against the
                            United States. I therefore earnestly hope that you may find it possible
                            to accept the compromise which we propose in paragraph 4 of our
                                telegram.<note n="79" xml:id="d257fn79">For the Department’s reply,

                        <p>171. Department’s 81, March 9, 11 a.m.</p>
                        <p>1. On March 4 a member of the Budget Committee of the Lower House
                            interpellated the Minister for Foreign Affairs<note n="81"
                                xml:id="d259fn81">Koki Hirota.</note> on relations with the United
                            States. He made extended reference to the <hi rend="italic">Panay</hi>
                            incident and expressed the opinion that the bombing was due to the
                            excitement of the air force while in hot pursuit of the enemy. The
                            interpolator then put the following question to the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs [<hi rend="italic">of the Navy</hi>].</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Was it not necessary to have the man who commanded this squadron one

                                the complicated international relationships and one who was a deep
                                thinker? Even though a man be careful and considerate it is not
                                unreasonable for him to lose his cool judgment in the ‘heat of
                                battle’ to wipe out the enemy. I would like the Navy Minister to
                                deeply consider the administration of personnel who operate in the
                                complicated sections of war operations and I would like to have the
                                Navy Minister pay attention to the administration of personnel so
                                that such a thing as this (<hi rend="italic">Panay</hi>) will not

                        <p>The office of the Naval Attaché has translated as follows the complete
                            text of the reply of the Minister of the Navy as officially recorded:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I believe that Mr. Takahashi’s questions can be generally
                                    divided into two points; first, the problem of administration of
                                    personnel and, second, that of communication liaison. According
                                    to the views of the authorities (naval) I understand there was
                                    nothing to be desired as far as personnel administration is
                                    concerned and consequently there was no connection of any kind
                                    between the so-called <hi rend="italic">Panay</hi> incident and
                                    the question of administration of personnel. I concur in that
                                    opinion. Generally speaking the question of administration of
                                    personnel is a very serious one. As for myself, I am exerting my
                                    best efforts toward the proper administration of personnel and
                                    in the future this same policy will be followed. We have hoped
                                    that communications in time of battle would be carried out
                                    completely and with satisfaction. However, it would be difficult
                                    to guarantee that some defect would never occur. Consequently,
                                    we are paying full attention so that there will be no repetition
                                    of such a breakdown in the future as occurred in the past or
                                    that new breakdowns occur in the future.”</p>

                        <p>2. The Naval Attaché informs me that the correspondent of the
                            International News Service whose story was based on the foregoing
                            statement has attempted to sensationalize the <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>3. The Naval Attaché will, as opportunity offers, endeavor to ascertain
                            discreetly what action, if any, has been taken in respect of those

                                        other immediately subsequent communications to the Foreign
                                        Office, I stated that only three Standard Oil vessels had
                                        been sunk, whereas in the detailed statement sent by Dooman
                                        to Yoshizawa several additional vessels are mentioned as
                                        having been sunk. No question of the facts has arisen, as
                                        the Japanese Navy has ascertained that all the vessels
                                        listed in Dooman’s letter were sunk. Nevertheless, for
                                        purposes of accounting and for other reasons which are
                                        confidential the Foreign Office would appreciate receiving
                                        from us a memorandum, dated as of today, setting forth the
                                        fact that omission from my notes of mention of the
                                        additional vessels under reference was due to
                                        impracticability of ascertaining exactly the total damage
                                        done until some time later.</item>

                                    <item>In paying the entire amount claimed for indemnification
                                        for personal injuries, the Japanese Government assumes that
                                        such amount does not include indemnification for cases of
                                        “nervous shock”. If the assumption should be incorrect, the
                                        Japanese Government hopes that no publicity will be given to
                                        the fact that persons who were “shocked” but otherwise
                                        unharmed are receiving indemnification. (For our personal
                                        information the Foreign Office explained that a British
                                        claim for several such cases was causing trouble, for the
                                        reason that cases of nervous shock are not sympathetically
                                        viewed “in certain Japanese quarters”).</item>

                        <p>2. Shanghai Municipal Council late yesterday issued an emergency
                            proclamation to the effect that as a period of grave emergency continues
                            to exist, armed outrages continue to occur on a grave scale in the
                            Settlement, and it accordingly appears necessary to the Council to
                            accord to the police certain emergency powers, therefore it is
                            proclaimed that “any person committing an offense against armed forces
                            in the International Settlement will be liable to be handed over to the
                            armed forces concerned, that any person committing armed crime in the
                            International Settlement will be refused the sanctuary of the Settlement
                            and will be liable to expulsion therefrom, that the municipal police are
                            authorized to search all premises public or private for unauthorized
                            arms” and that rewards will be paid to persons giving information
                            leading to the apprehension of terrorists or to the seizure of
                            unauthorized arms.</p>

                        <p>3. Japanese Consul General has addressed letter to Senior Consul saying
                            that Japanese military and naval authorities desire to obtain from the
                            Consuls General of interested powers in Shanghai all available
                            information on the exact location of properties of the third powers both
                            private and Government owned which are to be declared within or near the
                            zone of the present hostilities with a view to preventing the occurrence
                            of any unfortunate incident relative to such foreign properties. Letter
                            states that some colleagues have already <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215"

                            districts but in view of the activities of the Japanese forces extending
                            gradually to the inland of China it is desired to have further
                            information with as much detail as available and preferably with copies
                            of maps concerning the foreign properties that are found in any
                            important cities and towns in the interior of China.</p>
                        <p>2. All available information on the Shanghai District was supplied to the
                            Japanese some time ago under authority of the Department’s 270, August

                                Japanese military law. The French Ambassador advised his military

                        <p>14. Referring to my telegram No. 1220, December 23, 11 p.m.,<note n="97"
                                xml:id="d269fn97">Not printed.</note> yesterday afternoon 15 persons
                            representing the Japanese military authorities came to the radio station
                            in the International Settlement and announced that they were immediately
                            establishing Japanese censorship on all messages and taking control of
                            all funds received. They handed to George Shecklen, representative of R.
                            C. A. Communications, Incorporated, the affiliate of Radio Corporation
                            of America, a letter from the Japanese Consul General dated yesterday
                            saying that the Japanese military authorities having reached the
                            decision on November 27 to place the Chinese Government Radio
                            Administration under their control they were now despatching their
                            agents to the spot to give effect to that decision.</p>
                        <p>2. By an unsigned letter dated today and received about noon Shecklen
                            informed me of the foregoing and asked me immediately to enter a strong
                            protest on behalf of his company and to urge that the Japanese
                            authorities agree to neutral censorship and to the deposit intestate in
                            a neutral bank of the net revenues until a peace commission or other
                            similar body shall decide to whom they belong.</p>
                        <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0222"/>
                        <p>3. I called on the Japanese Consul General this afternoon and represented
                            to him orally and by memorandum that the Radio Corporation and the
                            Mackay Company, both American companies, have definite and substantial
                            interests in the radio establishment at Shanghai and in the revenues
                            thereof by way of traffic and other agreements and that the American
                            authorities expect that these, the American interests, will be
                            scrupulously respected and protected.</p>
                        <p>4. I discussed protocol at length with the Japanese Consul General and a
                            secretary whom he called in as being familiar with the details. I was
                            repeatedly assured that the Japanese authorities will respect the
                            traffic agreements held by the foreign companies and that they will also
                            respect any other obligations due under any agreement to the Radio
                            Corporation. As at the request of Shecklen, I advanced the proposals for
                            the neutral censorship and deposit of funds in a neutral bank. I was
                            informed that these proposals made by Shecklen had been reported to the
                            Japanese military who found them definitively unacceptable. I pointed
                            out that according to Shecklen Japanese control would probably result in
                            a walkout of the Chinese staff. They asserted they are prepared to meet
                            that situation, and that they desire to continue the radio service and
                            will maintain it. I inquired whether there had been any consideration of
                            control by a neutral committee of representatives of the interested
                            foreign companies. They replied that such a proposal had been considered
                            at the beginning but was opposed by Shecklen and would not now be given
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>5. The Chinese staff has not yet walked out but Shecklen expects them to
                            do so on orders of the Ministry of Communications to which he has
                            reported the situation.</p>
                        <p>6. The Japanese again told me that they question the agreement dated July
                            7 under which Shecklen claims his company has control and management of
                            the Shanghai station. They question the date and also whether the
                            agreement was made in good faith and not for ulterior purposes. Japanese
                            Consul General also told me he had positive proof that certain
                            statements or assurances given by Shecklen that the radio station was
                            not being used for the transmission of military information to the
                            Chinese were untrue.</p>
                        <p>6. [<hi rend="italic">7?</hi>] It remains to be seen whether the Japanese
                            are prepared at once to staff and maintain the radio service if the
                            Chinese walk out. While the main office is in the International
                            Settlement, several sending and receiving stations are in the French
                            Concession.</p>
                        <p>The French Ambassador discussed this matter with me yesterday morning,
                            inquiring concerning the alleged agreement of July 7, asserting that
                            Japanese censors would not be permitted in the French Concession but
                            could operate in the International Settlement, that the several foreign
                            companies should agree on a common policy where-upon <pb n="219"
                                xml:id="pg_219" facs="0223"/>the representatives of the interested
                            powers could deal with the Japanese and Chinese sides, and assured me
                            that in the interest of maintaining radio service, since the cables are
                            likely at any time to be broken, he will do what he can to keep the
                            stations in the French Concession in operation as long as possible.</p>
                        <p>7. [<hi rend="italic">8?</hi>] I have long been convinced that Shecklen
                            could not maintain his position against the Japanese particularly in
                            view of their distrust of him and that the only solution which would
                            adequately have protected all interests was to be found in a committee
                            control which the Japanese say they will not now consider.</p>

                            General Hospital. According to Dr. Brown, during first week of
                            occupation Japanese troops engaged in “ruthless treatment and slaughter
                            of civilians and wanton looting and destruction” of private property in
                            the city. Persons of foreigners have been respected but where property
                            was left unguarded it has usually been pilfered. Japanese Army, Navy and
                            Consular officials called on him separately to apologize for the tearing
                            of an American flag from hospital junk on December 13th. Two American

                                    proclamation in which it is stated that ‘any person committing

                        <p>7. Arrived Nanking 11:00 a.m. and met by Japanese Consul, naval and
                            military representatives who were very cooperative. Following is brief
                            preliminary report concerning American lives and property here.</p>
                        <p>All Americans in city are safe and well. There has been considerable
                            looting of American property by Japanese soldiers though the situation
                            has improved of late. Buildings have been but slightly damaged while
                            contents left unguarded have generally been looted. American residents
                            without [<hi rend="italic">with</hi>] whom I had lunch tell an appalling
                            story of wanton killing of civilian Chinese and violation of women, some
                            taking place in American property. Standard Oil and Texaco installations
                            entered and stocks removed though amounts taken still unknown.</p>
                        <p>General conditions in city slowly returning to normal. Embassy has water
                            but no electricity. Food supplies restricted somewhat. Japanese troops
                            still imperfectly controlled but it is believed worst is over.</p>
                        <p>Embassy buildings and all property in two compounds generally in good
                            condition. Japanese have returned two of the automobiles taken and have
                            offered to replace with new automobiles the six not returned. Embassy

                        <p>26. George Shecklen, representative of RCA Communications, has just
                            informed me by telephone that he has moved into the International
                            Settlement certain radio apparatus set up several months ago at his
                            house for the purpose of radio broadcasts to the United States, that he
                            proposes to use this apparatus for radio messages, and that he expects
                            American protection. Asked as to his authority to maintain such service,
                            he said that the radio broadcast stations had been authorized by the
                            Chinese Ministry of Communications which is the only “legal authority”
                            in Shanghai. I informed Shecklen that I was not in a position to extend
                            him protection in this activity without instructions from the Department
                            and that I expected him to inform me immediately in writing of his
                            intentions which I shall report to the Department with a request for
                            instructions. I cannot believe that his principal will countenance such
                            activities which only lead to serious difficulties with the

                        <p>13. United Press representative Hankow informs me he is unable to serve
                            Shanghai clients by regular wire services through Hong Kong. He asks
                            that naval radio facilities Hankow to Shanghai be opened to him. Service
                            Hankow–Hong Kong–United States is open. I am embarrassed by request
                            because it would be necessary for me to exercise supervision over
                            contents of messages lest radio service now needed by the Government be
                            compromised. I would welcome Department’s advice in this matter.</p>

                        <p>8. During the last week of December Japanese soldiers broke into both
                            Embassy compounds frequently and in addition to taking the two motor
                            cars previously reported took money and property, including jewelry and
                            watches, belonging to members of the Chinese staff and servants
                            totalling in value several hundred dollars Chinese currency. With the
                            exception of the motor cars, property belonging to American members of
                            staff has suffered little or no damage. On December 30 representatives
                            of the Japanese Embassy offered to recompense all Chinese in the
                            compound for losses sustained and after consultation with American
                            residents here Mr. Seldon, Embassy clerk, accepted Chinese dollars
                            801.30 to be distributed among the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>In conversation with Mr. Okamura of the Japanese Embassy yesterday I
                            pointed out the serious nature of this violation of American Embassy
                            property and employees and stated that some form of redress must be
                            made. Mr. Okamura admitted the violation of Embassy property and stated
                            that the Japanese Government was willing to make an official apology. He
                            inquired whether in view of the fact that the Japanese
                            Commander-in-Chief in this area is an Imperial Prince<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d278fn8">Yasuhiko Asaka.</note> an apology tendered by his
                            Chief of Staff to me as the American representative would be sufficient.
                            If not, Mr. Okamura asked if an apology by the Japanese Ambassador to
                            the American Ambassador would be required on [<hi rend="italic"
                            >or?</hi>] whether the American Government would require an official
                            apology from the Japanese Government tendered by the Japanese Ambassador
                            at Washington. Mr. Okamura said that his Government hoped that the
                            affair could be settled by a local apology in Nanking for it feared that
                            if much publicity were given the matter as a result of a more formal
                            apology public opinion in both Japan and the United States would become
                            inflamed and perhaps lead to further tension between the two countries.
                            I replied that it would be necessary for me to consult the Ambassador
                            and the State Department before I could inform him what form of apology
                            would be satisfactory. Instructions are requested in this regard.</p>
                        <p>Besides the foregoing, ample details regarding other American property
                            violations follow tomorrow.</p>

                                >Adm. William D. Leahy.</note> learned by accident a few days ago
                            that a contingent of U. S. Marines sent as re-enforcements to Shanghai
                            in August 1937 had been withdrawn. Responding to Department’s request
                            for particulars, Navy Department informed us on January 4 that there
                            left Shanghai on November 10 last, on the <hi rend="italic"

                            enlisted men.</p>
                        <p>This apparently had not been especially reported to Navy Department or in
                            any way to this Department.</p>
                        <p>This Government is trying to maintain close liaison with other
                            governments interested in common with us in problems of protection, etc.
                            Exchange of information and views with regard to use and movements of
                            armed forces in connection with those problems is a part of the

                            is sometimes desirable and sometimes not desirable. Department therefore

                            or decreases are in contemplation or are effected.</p>

                        <p>18. Reference your 26, January 6, 6 p.m. The Department today
                            communicated by telephone to W. A. Winterbottom, General Manager of RCA
                            Communications, New York, the substance of your message in regard to the
                            establishment by Shecklen of a radio transmitting station in the

                            such project; that RCA’s relations with the Japanese authorities were
                            good; and that he desired to keep them so. He expressed his disapproval
                            of the proposed project and requested that this information be
                            communicated to you.</p>

                            from Japanese Ambassador that, careful consideration having been given
                            to the suggestion concerning safety of lives and property of foreigners
                            in and around Hankow, the Japanese authorities both civil and military
                            came to the conclusion that they were unable to do better in answering
                            the note under acknowledgment than to bring to your knowledge the
                            following general principle to which the Japanese forces have so firmly
                            subscribed, that is, the Japanese forces have no intention whatever to
                            attack such places as are not utilized by Chinese troops for military
                            purposes or such areas where Chinese troops have not established their
                            military works and establishments and where there are no Chinese

                            Allison in regard to the serious nature of the violation of American
                            Embassy property and outrages to employees by Japanese soldiers, and
                            considers that an effort should be made at least in the first instance
                            to effect a settlement locally at Nanking which settlement if
                            satisfactory would obviate diplomatic action. The Department considers
                            that such settlement should consist of an official apology and
                            compensation. The Embassy should therefore instruct Allison to inform
                            Okamura that this Government would consider acceptable an official
                            apology tendered personally to Allison, as the representative of the
                            Ambassador, by the chief of staff in the name of the Commander-in-Chief

                            was returned in good condition late yesterday afternoon and shortly
                            afterwards Acting Consul General Fukui came to the Embassy and presented
                            160 gallons of gasoline which he stated was in partial compensation for
                            the three Embassy cars “borrowed” by the Japanese Embassy. In view of
                            the difficulty of obtaining gasoline supplies, I accepted this
                            contribution but stated that the final settlement of the matter would
                            have to be discussed at a later date.</p>

                            disclosed that the main building of the Methodist Episcopal Mission
                            North on Shenchoulu was gutted by fire, reputedly of Japanese origin, a
                            few days after the fall of Nanking. Other pieces of American property
                            damaged, belonged to United Christian Mission where two buildings of
                            boys’ school were burned and to American Church Mission where parish
                            house was hit by shell fire.</p>

                            buildings intact though partially looted. American residents have
                            reported numerous cases of Japanese soldiers tearing down and mutilating
                            American flags and showing complete disregard for measures of American

                            the property concerned. American property located in the so-called

                            pilfering.</p>
                        <p>I have made several oral and informal protests to the Japanese Embassy

                            of this destruction is supposed to have taken place after the Japanese
                            entered the City. Our water supply has again been cut off and there is

                        <p>43. Reports received from American missionaries at Soochow and Hangchow
                            indicate that there has been much looting of American property by
                            Japanese troops in spite of the fact that almost without exception such
                            properties were clearly marked by American flags and that in many
                            instances they also bore notices issued by this office in the English,
                            Japanese and Chinese languages indicating American ownership.</p>
                        <p>I have protested to the Japanese Consul General here against the looting
                            of American property which appears to have been continuing and have
                            requested that these facts be brought to the immediate attention of
                            General Matsui;<note n="12" xml:id="d284fn12">Japanese Army Commander in
                                Chief in Central China area.</note> that the soldiers responsible be
                            disciplined and that stringent orders be issued and enforced to prevent
                            extended looting, to protect to the fullest extent all American property
                            in the areas now occupied by troops under General Matsui’s command. I

                            inducing the Japanese authorities to take really effective measures to
                            prevent further looting and give adequate protection to American

                            foreigners and he thought that there was not the slightest intention of
                            applying these regulations to Americans. He did not seem disposed to
                            give me specific assurances on this point but took the position that we
                            would have no cause for complaint. I pointed out informally that any
                            attempt on the part of any Japanese agencies to [assert at?] Shanghai
                            jurisdiction over American nationals in China could not be recognized or
                            countenanced by the United States Government.</p>

                        <p>15. British and German Embassy officials arrived in Nanking yesterday
                            morning. The military authorities have, so far, refused to permit any
                            but Embassy or Consular officials to land, the prohibition extending to
                            foreign military and naval officers who are not attached to an
                            Embassy.</p>
                        <p>I have been informed that my British and German colleagues have requested
                            their respective Embassies in Hankow to approach the Chinese Government
                            with a view to preventing Chinese air raids upon Nanking and I have been
                            asked to bring the matter to the attention of the American Ambassador.
                            In addition to the small group of foreigners here, there are said to be
                            some 200,000 Chinese refugees within the city walls, the majority of
                            them concentrated in the so-called “safety zone”. Providing the
                            Ambassador perceives no objection, it is requested that the Chinese
                            Government be informed of the above and requested to refrain from
                            indiscriminate bombing of this city.</p>

                        <p>27. Following is a synopsis of Embassy translation of note from Ministry
                            of Foreign Affairs dated January 10 and received today:</p>
                        <p>A report has been received from the Ministry of Communications that it is
                            informed that the British, Danish and American cable companies concerned
                            “have acceded to demands of the Japanese authorities that copies of all
                            press telegrams be sent for censorship and that cable charges be
                            deposited with the Yokohama Specie Bank”. The Ministry has informed the
                            companies that the censorship procedure is detrimental to the sovereign
                            rights of China and that telegraph charges should be paid to the
                            Ministry as in the past in conformity with the agreements. The companies
                            replied: “The sovereign rights of China must be respected, but under
                            present circumstances there is no way to stop censorship by the Japanese
                            authorities. Concerning telegram charges we have received notice from
                            the Consuls concerned. The Japanese authorities served a notice that the
                            telegraph charges of the company therefore could not be paid to the
                            National Government; otherwise they would take appropriate measures. As
                            a result of mutual discussions and in order to prevent seizure of the
                            money by third party, it is proposed that, prior to the conclusion of
                            the war, both parties continue to settle accounts as usual, but that the
                            payment of the telegraph charges be temporarily stopped. It is not yet
                            decided whether the money will be deposited with a neutral bank or the
                            Yokohama Specie Bank, but the companies will, of course, assume <pb
                                n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0236"/>responsibility for it.” The
                            Ministry of Communications then stated: “The proposals mentioned above
                            are contrary to the provisions of the mutual agreements and repugnant to
                            the sovereign rights of this country” and that representatives would be
                            sent to request the companies to reject the Japanese demands. It asked
                            that the Diplomatic Missions concerned suitably instruct their
                            respective cable companies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs endorsed
                            this by requesting that the Commercial Pacific Cable Company be promptly
                            instructed to reach a satisfactory settlement with the Ministry of
                            Communications and stated that it was similarly addressing the British
                            and Danish Missions.</p>

                        <p>21. Japanese soldiers continue to enter American property at will and
                            remove goods and employees of American institutions without giving
                            notice or reasons for their action, the most recent cases in some
                            respects within the past 3 days, and I have therefore today addressed a
                            protest to the Japanese Embassy.</p>
                        <p>I stated that American residents have informed me that they have no
                            objection to the Japanese military authorities carrying out reasonable
                            and orderly searches of American property nor have the Americans any
                            desire to protect wrongdoers or interfere with the <pb n="233"
                                xml:id="pg_233" facs="0237"/>proper military control of the
                            population but that I must protest against this irregular, unexplained
                            and forcible entry of American property. I further stated that, in the
                            future, I must insist that when the Japanese military authorities desire
                            to search American property for any reason that the Embassy be notified
                            and given particulars as to the place to be searched and the objective.
                            I added that I would then be glad to designate a member of the Embassy
                            staff or a responsible American to accompany the soldiers and give them
                            every reasonable assistance.</p>
                        <p>I concluded by saying that “it is my desire to cooperate in every
                            possible way with the Japanese authorities but I cannot consent to
                            American property and the homes of American citizens being entered
                            arbitrarily nor can I agree to employees of American institutions being
                            removed by the Japanese military without any explanation”.</p>
                        <p>Sent to Embassy at Hankow, repeated to Shanghai. Shanghai please repeat
                            to Tokyo.</p>

                            via Shanghai and my January 8, 4 p.m. Methodist Mission building burned
                            on or about December 28th, according to responsible American citizens.
                            Boys school buildings of United Christian Mission burned between
                            December 24th and 27th on which dates an American member of the mission
                            visited the property 24th [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. He told me last
                            night that the buildings were intact on December [24?]. All the above
                            property is <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0238"/>located near
                            Taiping Road and districts in the south city known to have been burned
                            by Japanese. Also residents have stated to me that they saw no Chinese
                            on the above property except those authorized to be there while they
                            often saw Japanese soldiers on or near the property.</p>
                        <p>With regard to circumstances reported by American residents as mentioned
                            in third paragraph of my January 8, 4 p.m., I have on file in the
                            Embassy statements signed by responsible American citizens setting forth
                            many cases where the American flag was torn down or where American and
                            Japanese Embassy proclamations were deliberately disregarded. Six such
                            cases occurred on property of Nanking University alone while others took
                            place at Ginling College, the American School, and that [<hi
                                rend="italic">sic</hi>] at residences in addition to the incident at
                            Texas Company installation previously reported. These Americans have
                            expressed a willingness to make sworn affidavits should it be deemed
                            advisable.</p>
                        <p>Further reports of outrages by Japanese armed forces against Americans
                            and their property continue to be received almost daily. The most recent
                            occurred on the night of January 12th when Japanese soldier climbed over
                            the wall of Nanking University Middle School and after firing twice
                            within a class room filled with refugees seized a girl and went out over
                            the wall. On the afternoon of January 10th an armed Japanese soldier
                            forced the gateman of Nanking Theological Seminary to take him to third
                            floor of administration building where he seized a large quantity of
                            candles. On the afternoon of January 11th Japanese military police
                            entered residence of M. S. Bates, American professor at Nanking
                            University, and removed a Chinese who had been Japanese interpreter at
                            the University Middle School without asking permission or explanation.
                            Last two incidents were used as a basis for the protest reported in my
                            21, January 13, noon.</p>

                        <p>Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company; a China Trade Act corporation,
                            incorporated April 14, 1934, has established a factory at Hankow and is
                            manufacturing or assembling airplanes for Chinese Government. This
                            factory, formerly located at Hangchow in conjunction with China military
                            aviation training, recently moved to Hankow and now occupies premises
                            formerly owned by Standard Vacuum Oil <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235"
                                facs="0239"/>Company adjoining Japanese Concession. I am informed by
                            Standard Oil Company’s local manager that this property was sold to
                            Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company on November 20, 1937. Company
                            flies American flag over premises in question and is understood to
                            employ several American citizens although none are registered at this
                            office. It is currently rumored that Chinese Government is financially
                            interested in this, perhaps supplying operating expenses. Company is an
                            American juridical national. Supervision is American, construction
                            materials are of American origin. Product is for military use being war
                            planes. Financial backing is probably Chinese Government. I apprehend
                            that question of protection of this industry must inevitably arise
                            should hostilities extend to this area and shall appreciate Department’s

                        <p>34. Department’s 18, January 13, 7 p.m. I still adhere to the opinion
                            expressed in my telegram No. 13 of December 3, 3 p.m.<note n="15"
                                xml:id="d296fn15"><p>Not printed; in this telegram the Ambassador
                                    expressed approval of suggestions on the subject made by the
                                    Consul General at Shanghai in his telegram No. 1059, December 1,
                                    1937, midnight (893.73/112). These suggestions were as follows:
                                    “I believe it to be the opinion which I share that a local
                                    arrangement to; carry on without prior reference to the Chinese
                                    Government must be accepted; that censorship cannot be avoided;
                                    and that in the impounding of the Chinese portion of revenues
                                    deposits should if possible be made in accounts in banks of the
                                    companies’ individual selection although it is not likely this
                                    can be arranged.</p>
                                <p>I take the view that the decision must in each case be made by
                                    the company on its own responsibility, although in the light of
                                    the existing situation we might express an opinion having in
                                    mind the importance to both public and private interests of
                                    continuance of cable and radio communication.”</p></note> It is
                            my understanding that the Commercial Pacific Cable Company is connected
                            with its office in the International Settlement by a Chinese-owned line
                            which runs from the point where the cable lands at Woo-sung into the
                            Settlement through Chinese territory. The cable company is therefore
                            unable to control the end of the cable, as the Chinese National
                            authorities have been compelled to leave Shanghai by <hi rend="italic"
                                >force majeure</hi>. Under the circumstances and in the interest of
                            maintaining cable communications between Shanghai and the United States,
                            it seems to me that it is necessary for the company to struggle under
                            protest if necessary, and if arrangements can be made for depositing
                            that share of the cable tolls which by right should be paid to the
                            Chinese Government in a suspense account to be held until the question
                            of control over Shanghai has been settled as between Japan and China.
                                <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0240"/>it is the best arrangement

                        <p>46. Your 52, January 11, 10 a.m. The Department desires that you bring
                            emphatically to the attention of the Japanese authorities (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) our interest in the consolidated taxes,
                            pointing out that these taxes are security for the cotton, wheat and
                            flour credits of 1931 and 1933, which now form a consolidated obligation
                            of the Chinese Government held by the Export-Import Bank of Washington;
                            and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) our insistence that the Japanese
                            authorities take no action or countenance, in areas from which the
                            legitimate Chinese authorities have withdrawn, action by any provisional
                            regime which fails adequately to take into account the aforementioned
                            obligation of the Chinese Government to the Export–Import Bank. You may
                            add that we reserve the right to hold the Japanese authorities
                            accountable for action disregardful of our interests in this matter.</p>

                            obligation now amounts to $13,700,000, the Chinese Government having
                            paid the installment due December 31, 1937.</p>

                        <p>25. Reference my January 7, 4 p.m., and the Department’s 9, January 8, 4
                            p.m., to Hankow quoted in the Embassy, Hankow’s January 10, noon. In the
                            course of an informal conversation a few days ago with Mr. Okazaki,
                            Japanese Consul General at Large, I brought up the matter of the
                            Japanese apology and compensation for violation of American Embassy
                            property and I referred to the three proposals outlined by Okamura and
                            reported in my January 7, 4 p.m. Mr. Okazaki, much to my surprise,
                            expressed astonishment and said that Okamura could not have been talking
                            officially as Okazaki knew his instructions and they did not provide for
                            any such proposals. I stated that this was an extremely serious matter
                            and that I had already reported to the State Department and had received
                            instructions. Okazaki replied that under the circumstances Japan must
                            live up to the statement of all of its officers and make the required
                            apology and compensation. However, he thought it would be irregular for
                            a military officer to make the apology and he suggested that the apology
                            should be made by Acting Consul General Fukui, as representative of the
                            Japanese Ambassador, to me as representative of the American Ambassador.
                            [I] pointed out that in that case it <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238"

                            instructions and I added that I did not wish to request instructions
                            until I was certain what the official Japanese attitude would be.
                            Okazaki said he would ask Fukui to telegraph Ambassador Kawagoe for
                            instructions and that he, Okazaki, in a supplementary telegram would
                            recommend that Fukui give an apology and offer compensation. I stated I
                            would wait until I heard officially from Mr. Fukui before I communicated
                            with the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Fukui, having received his instructions, called on me yesterday
                            afternoon to discuss the matter. The following is a summary of our
                            discussion which, in order to avoid future misunderstanding, I drew up
                            in the form of a memorandum and obtained Mr. Fukui’s signature to it as
                            being a correct account of our conversation.</p>
                        <p>After reiterating what Okazaki said, Fukui stated that it was the desire
                            of the Japanese authorities that he, as the representative of the
                            Japanese Ambassador, should make the required apology. I said it would
                            be necessary to consult the Department of State and the American
                            Ambassador before I could say whether or not that would be satisfactory.
                            I told him that it was the opinion of the Department that the apology
                            should include an expression of regret for the desecration of the
                            American flag which had taken place on several occasions and he replied
                            that he would request instructions in that regard.</p>
                        <p>The question was then taken up of recent written assurances from the
                            Japanese Government covering adequate compensation for damages to
                            American property. Fukui said the Japanese wished to settle first the
                            matter of violation of Embassy’s property and compensation for damages
                            to it and that belonging to Embassy personnel and then discuss damages
                            to private American property. He added that the Japanese would make no
                            investigation of claims arising out of damage to Embassy property or
                            that belonging to staff members but would accept the statement of this
                            Embassy as to the amount of damage done. This also applies to cars of
                            private individuals taken from Embassy compound. Fukui said that he
                            would give me a letter either before or at the time of the apology. The
                            Japanese authorities would make compensation for such damage but he
                            wished to make it a personal rather than an official letter. I told him
                            I thought the letter should be official but would request
                            instructions.</p>
                        <p>With regard to compensation for damages to private American property,
                            Fukui said it would be necessary for the Japanese to make their own
                            investigation of claims presented. He added he would telegraph his
                            Government for permission to give me a written statement saying that the
                            Japanese Government would make compensation for all damages to American
                            property, excluding such damages as were the result of military
                            operations, proved to have been caused by the <pb n="239"
                                xml:id="pg_239" facs="0243"/>Japanese soldiers. I informed him I was
                            not at all certain such a statement would be satisfactory but that I
                            would report it to my Government. Instructions are therefore requested
                            on the following points: <list>

                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>Will the Department be satisfied with a personal letter to me
                                    from Fukui regarding the compensation for damages to Embassy

                                <label>(3)</label>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>In view of the apparently sincere desire of the Japanese to settle
                            quickly the matter of violation of Embassy property and their offer to
                            make prompt payment of damages therefor, I recommend that the first two
                            questions above be answered in the affirmative. I feel however, that the
                            proposed statement regarding settlement of damages to private American
                            property is unsatisfactory.</p>
                        <p>Repeated to Embassy, Hankow and Shanghai. Shanghai please repeat to
                            Tokyo.</p>

                        <p>Your January 14, 10 a.m. According to the Department’s records the
                            Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company, a China Trade Act corporation
                            organized by three American aviation companies, entered into a contract
                            with the Chinese Government under date December 8, 1933, under the terms
                            of which the company agreed to build and equip a factory near Hangchow
                            for the manufacture, assembly, and repair of airplanes, and to furnish
                            American supervision and technical personnel; and the Chinese Government
                            agreed to bear all expenses, other than first costs, of the maintenance
                            and operation of the factory, and to insure against all insurable
                            hazards including war. The contract also provided that the factory shall
                            become vested in the Chinese Government at the end of 5 years, and
                            contained a reservation of the right of that Government to take over the
                            factory at any time within the 5-year period. If this or any similar
                            contract is applicable to the factory at Hankow, it would seem that the
                            factory should be considered as fundamentally a Chinese enterprise
                            involving no substantial American interest which can properly claim
                            American protection.</p>
                        <p>Copies of the contract referred to above are on file at Peiping and
                            Nanking, detailed information in regard to which may possibly be
                            procurable from the Embassy staff at Hankow.</p>

                        <p>This brings to my mind the suggestion which I ventured a few days ago,
                            namely, that, if we really mean business in regard to the reducing of
                            our national risk in connection with the presence of our people in
                            China; and if we feel warranted in emphatically calling <pb n="242"
                                xml:id="pg_242" facs="0246"/>upon them to sacrifice their own views,
                            convenience, business interests, life investment, etc., in the interest
                            of their country and their fellow countrymen to the number of
                            130,000,000, considerations of businesslike procedure, morality, and
                            equity would warrant there being made by the country as a whole a
                            financial outlay toward consummating that objective. If we believe that
                            withdrawal by our nationals from China will help toward keeping this
                            country out of war; if we earnestly desire that our nationals withdraw;
                            might we not most effectively express our belief and attain our
                            objective in that connection by assuming as a public burden at least a
                            reasonable share of the cost, to the nationals who would have to
                            withdraw, of their withdrawal? In brief, would not a substantial
                            legislative appropriation for the purpose of effecting further
                            withdrawal be the best evidence that could be given of the sincerity of
                            those who advocate withdrawal, and would it not contribute usefully
                            toward that objective and also serve some other objectives?</p>

                            to either of these alternatives, the Department considers that it will
                            be necessary to instruct the Embassy at Tokyo to request that an
                            expression of regret be tendered either by the Japanese Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs to our Ambassador at Tokyo or by the Japanese Ambassador
                            in Washington to the Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>With regard to point 3, this Government is unable to admit that the
                            Japanese Government is relieved of responsibility for damages to
                            American property resulting from Japanese military operations at Nanking
                            and Allison should, therefore, point out to the Japanese authorities
                            that assurances containing such a disclaimer are unacceptable to this
                            Government. However, the Department would consider acceptable a
                            statement covering affirmatively damages caused by Japanese troops but
                            containing no express disclaimer for damages caused by military
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>Allison should not press the Japanese authorities on point 3, although he
                            may remind them that our willingness to consider a local settlement was
                            responsive to the desire expressed by the Japanese authorities, as
                            reported by Allison in his No. 8, January 7, 4 p.m., and that the
                            conditions which we have outlined were designed to obviate diplomatic
                            representations on specific cases occurring at Nanking.</p>
                        <p>If the Japanese authorities are unable to give satisfactory assurances on
                            point 3 as above outlined, the Department will expect to take up through
                            diplomatic channels claims against the Japanese Government which are
                            submitted by the American interests concerned in accordance with the
                            last paragraph of Department’s No. 12, January 11, 4 p.m.<note n="26"

                            been called upon by Messrs. Fukui and Fukuda of the Japanese Embassy and
                            Major Hongo of the staff of the garrison commander. They reported the
                            receipt of a telegram from the Foreign Office which referred to portions
                            my 27, January 18, 3 [<hi rend="italic">4</hi>] p.m. and they had come

                        <p>Major Hongo explained at great length the difficulties which confronted
                            the military in guarding foreign property and then he stated that strict
                            orders had been given for the punishment of any soldier caught in
                            foreign property as well as for punishment of their company officers. He
                            stated that for the next few days transfers of various military units in
                            this district might cause some confusion but that after the transfers
                            had ceased he was certain complete order would be restored. He requested
                            that I inform Washington and Tokyo of his call on me.</p>
                        <p>I thanked the gentlemen for their call and told them that I hoped I
                            should be able to report in a few days that violation of American
                            property had materially decreased.</p>

                        <p>We can well understand your difficulty in reaching a decision with <pb

                            followed in the complicated situation existing at Shanghai, but we have
                            necessarily taken the position that the interested American radio and
                            cable companies must make their decisions upon their own responsibility.
                            As of possible assistance to you, however, we offer the comment that,
                            from a legal standpoint it appears that any agreements with the Japanese
                            for the operation of the Chinese radio stations at Shanghai which do not
                            receive official Chinese approval must be viewed simply as a <hi
                                rend="italic">de facto</hi> temporary arrangement, without legal
                            basis, to meet a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> situation. As Colonel
                            Davis, of your company, has been informed, the Department’s attitude in
                            general is that it would not wish to interpose objection to temporary
                                <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> arrangements which it might be
                            necessary or advisable to work out in order to maintain communications
                            but that there could be no implication of official American
                            participation in the arrangements made.</p>
                        <p>We note that your Vice President in Shanghai, Mr. George F. Shecklen, is
                            in close touch with the American Consul General there and is seeking to
                            obtain observance by the Japanese military authorities of your
                            agreements with the Chinese Ministry of Communications. We feel
                            confident that Mr. Gauss will render all appropriate assistance in the

                        <p>34. Last night at about 8:30 p.m., three Japanese broke into one of the
                            Embassy garages now being occupied by families of some of the Embassy
                            police and while one of them made off with the sister of one of the
                            policemen the other two remained behind and endeavored to prevent the
                            Chinese from giving the alarm. However, I was informed that something
                            was wrong and with Vice Consul Espy I went to the police and found the
                            two Japanese there. At the time we did not know that a girl had been
                            taken; as the two Japanese left when foreigners were sighted, no attempt
                            was made to hold them. One of the men had on naval uniform and carried a
                            large pistol while the other was a civilian dressed in the type of
                            uniform usually worn by Young Men’s Christian Associations in Japan.
                            While we were preparing to go in search of the girl she returned saying
                            that the two Japanese we had seen had caught up with her just as she was
                            about to be placed in a car and driven away, and they had persuaded the
                            first man to release her because she worked for foreigners. It was
                            obvious that these Japanese did not know they were on Embassy property
                            but this is no excuse. While fortunately this incident did not result in
                            any serious damage to persons or property it would have done so if
                            foreigners had not been on the spot and it is typical of what is going
                            on in Nanking despite the assurances of the Japanese authorities that
                            efforts are being made to prevent such occurrences. It should be pointed
                            out that the Embassy is well within the so-called safety zone into which
                            none but authorized Japanese soldiers are supposed to enter and that the
                            garage which was entered is within 200 yards of a gendarme station. It
                            is several miles from the bund district controlled by the navy, thus
                            there is no understandable reason to think an armed <pb n="248"
                                xml:id="pg_248" facs="0252"/>naval enlisted man should be in the
                            vicinity. Japanese civilians have been observed occasionally on the
                            streets but this is the first time I have heard of one being engaged in
                            illegal activities. However, it is perhaps significant that certain
                            Japanese civilians are allowed to come to Nanking allegedly because
                            needed by the army as laborers or small shopkeepers, while the military
                            authorities have just refused the request of the University of Nanking
                            Hospital to bring to this city two American doctors, who are urgently
                            needed, on the ground that it is not yet safe for civilians to be
                            here.</p>
                        <p>I called this morning on Mr. Fukui and made strong oral protest about the
                            matter and told him I intended to report the matter at once to
                            Washington, to Tokyo. Fukui pleaded with me not to report the matter for
                            a few days because he was afraid it would aggravate American-Japanese
                            relations. He again referred to the special measures being taken by the
                            military authorities to prevent such incidents (see my 31, January 21, 4
                            p.m.), and assured me that if I would but wait a few days I would see a
                            great improvement in the situation. I told Fukui it would be necessary
                            to report the matter but I was willing that it be given no publicity for
                            the time being. It is therefore requested that this case not be made
                            public until a few days have elapsed and it can be seen whether or not
                            the special measures referred to above are really effective. Prompt
                            report will be made of any noticeable change for the better.</p>

                        <p>37. My 34, January 23, noon. Captain Nakahara, Naval Attaché to the
                            Japanese Embassy, called on me this afternoon to express regrets for the
                            unlawful entrance of an Embassy garage by a member of the navy. He said
                            a thorough investigation was being made and that strict rule had been
                            issued prohibiting naval personnel from coming within the walls of the
                            city any more on official business or on regularly conducted tours. From
                            a description of the uniform worn by the man seen by me, Captain
                            Nakahara was able to determine that he was probably a member of the Navy
                            Labor Corps and not a regular sailor. Assurances were given that there
                            would be no further incidents involving the navy. It should be pointed
                            out that there have <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0253"/>been but
                            few complaints of the actions of the Japanese Navy in Nanking and in
                            those sections of the city along the river front under navy control;
                            conditions are much better than elsewhere.</p>

                            bringing to a head the question of indemnities for lost property.</p>
                        <p>Under no circumstances can the major part of the looting be called a
                            necessary result of armed conflict. The buildings were not destroyed by
                            usual fire, by bombs, nor were the buildings or property to which I
                            refer destroyed or damaged as a necessary part of military operations
                            either offensive or defensive.</p>
                        <p>If you have not already begun to do so, I think we should start to lay
                            the foundation for holding Japan accountable in dollars for the acts of
                            her soldiers. Perhaps we should not suggest it until after our case has
                            been firmly established but it is a fact that there is a vast amount of
                            Japanese owned property in the United States and that we have excellent
                            precedent in the Alien Property Custodian Act<note n="36"

                                American firm, has been exchanging messages with the radio station

                                if it has in fact taken place, cannot but prejudice the traditional
                                friendship that exists between our two countries. The Ministry has
                                the honor to request, therefore, that the American Embassy will with
                                all speed issue instructions that the action described above shall

                        <p>45. Tokyo’s 53, January 26, 5 p.m.<note n="42" xml:id="d321fn42">Not
                                printed.</note> A dinner was given at the Japanese Embassy last
                            night to give an opportunity to the foreign diplomatic representatives
                            to meet Major General Homma, as well as the new garrison commander [at]
                            Nanking, Major General Amaya, who was formerly commander of the First
                            Infantry Division. Mr. Hidaka, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, had
                            also flown up from Shanghai for the occasion.</p>
                        <p>General Homma’s first words to me were an expression of deep regret for
                            the recent unfortunate incident.<note n="43" xml:id="d321fn43">A
                                reference to the incident involving Secretary of Embassy Allison;
                                see footnote 41, <ref target="#pg_252">p. 252</ref>.</note> I
                            assured the General that, now that my Government had the Japanese reply
                            to its [representations?] at Tokyo, my only desire was to forget the
                            affair as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>General Homma dwelt at some length on the war psychology of the Japanese
                            troops which he claimed had been at the root of much of the trouble in
                            Nanking. He stated his sole purpose in coming here was to impress on the
                            local troops that foreign property must be respected. He asked us not to
                            be impatient if isolated incidents continued to take place because he
                            claimed it was exceedingly difficult to make sure that orders issued by
                            the High Command were carried out at once by the private soldiers.
                            Lieutenant [Colonel?] Hirota will come to Nanking in a few days,
                            according to General Homma, and we were urged to take any complaints
                            directly to him and thus settle all questions locally without appealing
                            to Tokyo.</p>
                        <p>General Homma appeared to be more interested in explaining the Japanese
                            position than in listening to what the foreign representatives might
                            have to say. He is returning to Shanghai this afternoon by plane without
                            having further contact with any of the foreigners, as far as is known.
                            However, Mr. Hidaka is remaining several days and he tells me that in
                            the future he will make periodic trips to Nanking. It is believed that
                            with a person of his rank coming here from time to time it will be
                            possible in the future to obtain more assistance from the Japanese
                            Embassy than has been forthcoming in the past.</p>

                            Mr. Fukui was unable to see me to discuss the Department’s instructions
                            until just recently. With regard to point 1 he stated it would be
                            necessary to consult higher authorities before stating what the Japanese
                            Government would do. He asked me why the State Department did not wish
                            to have the apology made through the local diplomatic channels and
                            insisted upon it being made by a military officer. I replied that I had
                            no information on that point.</p>
                        <p>In regard to point 3, Mr. Fukui again stated that the Japanese Government
                            could not be responsible for damages resulting from military operations
                            and said that if this was insisted upon it would be necessary to handle
                            the claims in Tokyo. He suggested that the matter of violation of
                            Embassy property be settled first and that we then discuss the
                            settlement of private claims. I told him that if the first matter could
                            be settled promptly, I saw no objection to this procedure. Mr. Fukui
                            promised to call upon me shortly and give the Japanese answer to the
                            Department’s demands, but he has not yet done so. I intend to see him
                            this evening and ask when I may expect his reply.</p>

                        <p>33. With reference to Shanghai’s 142 of January 26, 3 p.m., reporting
                            looting of American property at Soochow and Hangchow, the Department
                            transmits for your information the following telegram received from W.
                            G. Cram, General Secretary, Board of Missions, M. E. Church South:

                        <p>These two telegrams are merely illustrative of the numerous complaints
                            that are being received by the Department of the utter disregard shown
                            by Japanese armed forces for American property in China.</p>
                        <p>Department desires that you address a formal note to the Foreign Office
                            as under instructions from your Government calling attention to these
                            numerous depredations as illustrated by these and other reports which
                            have been sent to you and stating that your Government finds it
                            impossible to reconcile these lawless acts directed against American
                            missionary properties with the assurances repeatedly given by the
                            Japanese Government that American rights and interests in China will be
                            fully respected by the armed forces of the Japanese Government; that it
                            appears that these incidents have occurred with the knowledge and some
                            indeed in the presence of Japanese officials while others such as the
                            occupancy of mission properties by Japanese troops were presumably by
                            the express direction of military officers; that arbitrary entry and
                            occupation, together with pilfering, looting and wanton destruction of
                            property, can in no sense be regarded as acts of a character to be
                            expected from a properly controlled military organization; that your
                            Government assumes that the Japanese Government in nowise approves or
                            condones such lawlessness and expects assurances from the Japanese
                            Government (1) that it will take immediate and specific steps to put an
                            end to the depredating of American properties and (2) that it will make
                            full and complete indemnification for all losses and damages

                        <p>I think that we now have a very good foundation for holding Japan
                            accountable in dollars for the acts of her military organizations in
                            China. While we do not have sufficiently accurate information in very
                            many cases to enable us to present separate claims at this time, the
                            groundwork has been laid and we have been able in a few instances to
                            obtain admissions of liability from Japan, and in one case payment
                            locally of a small claim has actually been made.</p>

                            the military operations of Japanese forces were confined to measures of
                            defense against illegal provocative attacks on the part of China and
                            that in those circumstances the Japanese Government was not liable for
                            damages or losses sustained by nationals of other countries.</p>
                        <p>In order to avoid possible assumption by the Japanese Government that
                            this Government acquiesced in this disclaimer of liability, we

                            the Foreign Office stating that this Government could not accept this
                            position of the Japanese Government and that we would be under the
                            necessity of looking to that Government for compensation to the extent
                            that liability exists under international law.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Government did not formally reply to this last mentioned
                            note but an official of the Foreign Office orally stated to a member of
                            the Embassy that the views previously expressed by the Foreign Office
                            had not been altered.</p>
                        <p>We make strong representations to the Japanese Government in all cases of
                            depredations upon American life or property as rapidly as the incidents
                            are brought to our attention. In practically all cases the Japanese
                            Government disclaims any intention of injuring American life or
                            property, and in a number of instances they have indicated willingness
                            to make reparation. In one case, namely that of the American Board
                            Mission at T’ungchow, a local settlement satisfactory to the Mission was
                            made for damage caused by the dropping of bombs by Japanese planes.</p>

                            concerning the mission properties at Soochow and Hangchow, to which you
                            refer, and have directed the Ambassador to make strong representations
                            to the Foreign Office and to request assurances <pb n="257"
                                xml:id="pg_257" facs="0261"/>that immediate and specific steps will
                            be taken to put an end to these depredations and that full and complete
                            indemnification will be made.</p>
                        <p>I appreciate that there is a vast amount of Japanese property in the
                            United States and that there is precedent for sequestration of property
                            under certain circumstances; also that we have the Trading with the
                            Enemy Act, making provision for an alien property custodian, as a
                            precedent. That Act, however, as you know, applied only to property of
                            people denominated as “enemies” within the meaning of the Act. It really
                            is a precedent only for a situation where the United States is a
                            belligerent.</p>

                                    several months ago that in view of the possible spread of
                                    hostilities Americans are urged to leave areas which might
                                    become dangerous and if necessary to withdraw from the country.
                                    In view of the likelihood of hostilities or disorder in Honan
                                    Province in the near future you are now earnestly urged to
                                    consider whether you should withdraw from that province while
                                    communications are still possible. It is requested that you
                                    inform all other Americans at your station. With a view of
                                    having on file at this office as complete information as
                                    possible regarding the location of American property in areas of
                                    possible future military operations it is suggested that if you
                                    so desire your mission station prepare and forward to this
                                    office in duplicate a map of the city and the location of the
                                    property of your mission. In some cases it may be possible to
                                    procure and forward printed maps of the city or locality on
                                    which can be marked the location of the mission property. If
                                    not, sketch maps drawn as nearly as possible to scale map may be
                                    used.”</p>

                        <p>51. Nanking’s 46, February 2, 4 p.m., and Department’s 29, January 21, 2
                            p.m. Unless the Japanese authorities at Nanking are prepared to act
                            promptly in the matter of an expression of regret on the basis outlined
                            in the Department’s telegram under reference, the Department will feel
                            obliged in view of the delay that has already occurred to take up this
                            point through diplomatic channels at Tokyo.</p>
                        <p>The Department approves of Allison’s statement to Fukui that no objection
                            is perceived to the settlement of the violation of Embassy property
                            before proceeding to the discussion of the settlement of private
                            claims.</p>
                        <p>With regard to private claims, the Department is prepared, as indicated
                            in the third and fourth paragraphs of the Department’s telegram under
                            reference, to have Allison discuss a local settlement of such cases as
                            the Japanese officials at Nanking have been duly authorized to settle.
                            It is, therefore, not clear why the question of a disclaimer of
                            responsibility for damages resulting from military operations such as
                            the Japanese authorities propose to make should be brought into the
                            discussion. Should they further insist upon including such a disclaimer
                            of responsibility in the proposed written statement mentioned in
                            Nanking’s 25, January 18, 10 a.m., Allison’s acknowledgment should
                            contain a statement to the effect that as this Government reserves all
                            rights in respect to such damages, this Government will regard the
                            Japanese statement as not prejudicing this Government’s right to take up
                            through diplomatic channels claims arising out of military
                            operations.</p>

                        <p>The Department is asking the Embassy at Hankow to endeavor to furnish you

                        <p>The Department considers it important that there should be kept in mind
                            the distinction between representations of a general character, such as
                            those to which your telegram under reference relates, and which seek
                            objectives of broad principle covering the two points enumerated in the
                            Department’s 33 of February 2, 5 p.m., and representations looking to
                            the concrete settlement of specific cases. As some of the evidence which

                            your general representations may also be concerned with cases for which
                            a local settlement is being sought or with cases the presentation of

                            investigation and examination, it is believed that you should make this
                            point clear to the Foreign Office in order to avoid possible
                            misunderstanding.</p>

                        <p>51. My 50, February 7, 1 p.m.,<note n="55" xml:id="d329fn55">Not
                                printed.</note> and the Department’s 51, February 4, 4 p.m. Mr.
                            Fukui called upon me this evening and stated he had just received
                            instructions from his Government to make a counterproposal regarding the
                            expression of regrets for violation of Embassy’s property to that
                            outlined in the Department’s 29, January 21, 2 p.m. The Japanese
                            Government now suggests that the expression of regrets be made to the
                            appropriate American Consul General in Shanghai by Major General Harada,
                            Military Attaché to the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai and Chief of the
                            Special Service Department of the Expeditionary Force. Mr. Fukui pointed
                            out that the Special Service Department handles all external matters
                            affecting the army and that the other officers of the army are engaged
                            in active military operations and therefore not available for making
                            such apologies. I told Mr. Fukui I was not certain this would be
                            satisfactory but that I would request immediate instructions. Mr. Fukui
                            went on to say that if I would then give him a memorandum concerning
                            damage to Embassy’s property and that of Embassy’s personnel he would
                            give me a personal letter stating that full compensation would be made.
                            He added that he believed arrangements could be made to make prompt
                            payment through the American Consul General, Shanghai, because of the
                            lack of banking facilities in Nanking. I asked whether he meant to imply
                            payment Embassy compensation was contingent upon my Government accepting
                            the proposal that General Harada should make the apology and he replied
                            he did not believe so but that he would telegraph at once to make
                            certain.</p>
                        <p>A Russian motor mechanic has examined the three automobiles taken by the
                            Japanese and later returned and has stated that the damage which could
                            be traced to the Japanese is negligible. As the Japanese Embassy had
                            presented this office with 160 gallons of gasoline it is not believed
                            necessary to request further compensation for the use of these
                            machines.</p>
                        <p>With regard to compensation for damages to private American property Mr.
                            Fukui said he would call upon me tomorrow.</p>

                        <p>52. My 51, February 7, 8 p.m., and the Department’s 51, February 4, 4
                            p.m. With regard to private claims the Department’s position, as
                            outlined in the telegram under reference, was carefully explained to Mr.
                            Fukui but he insisted upon including in any note he might write the
                            following statement: “The Japanese will not assume responsibility for
                            damages resulting from military operations.” I have informed him that in
                            such a case I should have to make an express reservation of all rights
                            in respect to such damages. It is believed, as a matter of fact, that
                            damages to American property in Nanking caused by military operations
                            are comparatively slight as most of the damage occurred after the
                            occupation of the city by the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese authorities insist upon making investigations into each case
                            as it is presented with a view to establishing whether the damage was
                            actually caused by Japanese troops or by Chinese looters and
                            plain-clothes soldiers who, according to the Japanese, were responsible
                            for much of the disorder in the city. It is feared that considerable
                            delay may take place in the settlement of these claims inasmuch as in
                            many cases it will be impossible to prove absolutely who the guilty
                            party was. I therefore suggest that in the presentation of claims for
                            damages known to have taken place after the fall of Nanking I be
                            instructed to take the following stand: inasmuch as a number of American
                            citizens, who were in Nanking at the time of its occupation,
                            investigated the condition of much of the American property in the city,
                            it is possible to know definitely whether such property was in good
                            condition on and after the Japanese occupation. It is believed that
                            responsibility for law and order in Nanking after its fall rests with
                            the Japanese authorities who were in occupation and that claims for such
                            damages as can be proved to have taken place on or after December 13,
                            1937, the date of the occupation, should be paid by the Japanese with a
                            minimum of delay. Such damages as may have been caused by military
                            operations can then be taken up through diplomatic channels in Tokyo,
                            while the smaller claims, mostly for damages to property of individuals,
                            can be settled locally in Nanking. Instruction on this point is
                            requested.</p>

                        <p>239. Referring to my 125, January 22, 1 p.m. concerning Wuhu incidents.
                            Japanese Consul General has now handed me a letter with attached
                            memorandum covering investigations made by consular and military
                            authorities from which it appears that as to the flag incident they have
                            been unable to find Japanese soldiers involved in the case. The
                            memorandum shows that during a recent visit of doctor to Shanghai he
                            told a Japanese consular officer that he did not personally witness the
                            incident and that when he hurriedly arrived on the scene he failed to
                            see any Japanese soldier in the neighborhood. As to the incidents
                            involving American property, the letter states “the Japanese authorities
                            have also exhausted every possible means of investigation in regard to
                            these cases but they have so far been unable to find out the soldiers
                            responsible for the incidents. I feel constrained however to express to
                            you my profound regret over the prima facie involvement of Japanese
                            soldiers in such incidents and to state at the same time that the
                            Japanese authorities are ready to consider the payment of reasonable
                            compensation for damages caused to such American property in Wuhu upon
                            receipt of full details from the sufferers concerned.”</p>

                        <p>54. Embassy’s February 10, 5 p.m., quoting the Department’s 62 [<hi

                            handed to Mr. Fukui a memorandum concerning the losses suffered by the
                            Embassy and Embassy personnel. The Japanese have not insisted upon
                            replacement of motor cars taken from the Embassy compound but have said
                            this [<hi rend="italic">they?</hi>] would make cash payments for all
                            such cars. Mr. Fukui stated he would hand me a letter within a few days
                            saying that arrangements were being made to have the Japanese Consul
                            General in Shanghai hand to the American Consul General there the
                            amounts requested. The claim presented to the Japanese totals United
                            States dollars 6,796 plus Chinese dollars 10,118. This includes United
                            States dollars 3,300 compensation for damage to Jenkins’ property.</p>

                        <p>With regard to a solatium for family of Jenkins’ servant, Mr. Fukui has
                            expressed some reluctance to make the requested payment unless it could
                            be absolutely proved that the servant had been killed by Japanese
                            soldiers. I pointed out that the prompt payment of a solatium would
                            create a favorable impression abroad and after some discussion Mr. Fukui
                            promised to discuss the matter further with the military.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Fukui was asked when he expected the expression of regrets and the
                            payment would be made and he replied that as he wished to leave for
                            Shanghai about February 15 he hoped everything would be settled before
                            that date.</p>

                            Japanese officials accompanying affiants observed such acts, a statement
                            to that effect should be included in the affidavits together with

                            Japanese authorities of the proposed written statement regarding
                            compensation for damages to private American property mentioned in the
                            antipenultimate paragraph of Nanking’s 25, January 18, 10 a.m., present
                            to them only such claims as are included within the categories which the

                            locally. Allison should make no effort to press the Japanese authorities
                            to settle claims other than those which they voluntarily offered to
                            settle, as the Department will expect to take up in due course the
                            question of the presentation of the remaining claims to the Japanese
                            Government for diplomatic settlement.</p>
                        <p>With regard to claims which are to be taken up locally, it is suggested
                            that Allison advise claimants to obtain from Americans who have
                            inspected American property in the city affidavits setting forth full
                            information regarding the particular properties inspected and their
                            condition at the time of inspection and that such affidavits be
                            submitted to the Japanese in support of claims predicated upon damages
                            subsequently sustained by such inspected properties. Allison should
                            obtain from Americans whose claims have been locally settled copies for
                            the files of the Embassy and the Department of receipts which they
                            furnish to the Japanese authorities as evidence of settlement.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the preparation of claims for diplomatic settlement, the
                            Department expects shortly to issue detailed instructions.</p>

                        <p>257. Reference Department’s 61, February 9, 7 p.m., to Hankow, Consul
                            General Okazaki called on me this afternoon and said that General Harada
                            is prepared to express regret for the violation of the Embassy property
                            and to give assurances that there will be no repetition but he is unable
                            to express regret for the desecration of the American flag until it has
                            been proven that Japanese soldiers committed such desecration. He is
                            prepared to express regret provisionally, that is, he would say that he
                            would deeply regret the desecration <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266"
                                facs="0270"/>of the American flag if upon investigation it is found
                            to have occurred. Okazaki said that Allison had communicated to Fukui
                            several instances of alleged desecration of the flag but he has not even
                            given the names of witnesses, simply stating than an American has
                            reported or a Chinese has reported the case. He said that investigations
                            will delay matters for about a month as troops formerly in Nanking are
                            now scattered.</p>
                        <p>2. I told Okazaki that I was instructed to receive an expression of
                            regret from General Harada which should include regret for the
                            desecration of the flag and under the circumstances I would be under the
                            necessity of referring [again?] for instructions.</p>

                        <p>57. Shanghai’s 257, February 14, 8 p.m. Instances of desecration of
                            American flags given to Fukui were taken from copies of letters which
                            had been sent to the Japanese Embassy by American citizens before the
                            return of American officials. The first letter was sent on December 16,
                            1937, additional were sent at various times during the last weeks of
                            December. As far as is known, the Japanese Embassy never acknowledged
                            the receipt of any of these letters, nor was any effort made to
                            investigate these matters at the time they were reported which could
                            have been done with ease. When I handed the list to Fukui I asked him if
                            it was all right or if he desired more information and he said it was
                            sufficient. In view of the fact that the Japanese authorities have had
                            written notice of these desecrations to the American flag for almost 2
                            months, I do not see how further delay for investigation can be
                            allowed.</p>

                        <p>58. My 57, February 15, noon, and Shanghai’s 257, February 14, 8 p.m. Mr.
                            Fukui called just after my number 57 had been sent and <pb n="267"
                                xml:id="pg_267" facs="0271"/>made a similar statement regarding the
                            desired form of expressing regret for the desecration of American flags
                            as Mr. Okazaki made to Mr. Gauss. He said he wished me to report to my
                            Government that the Japanese authorities had a sincere desire to bring
                            about a speedy settlement of the matter but that I must understand that
                            it was necessary for the military to make investigations into the truth
                            of the charges. Because of this sincere desire for a speedy and local
                            settlement the form of regret as outlined by Mr. Okazaki had been
                            evolved and he hoped it would prove satisfactory to the American
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. Fukui that I could understand the wish of the military
                            authorities to make an investigation but I could not understand why such
                            an investigation had not been undertaken when the first reports of
                            desecration had been submitted to the Japanese Embassy by local American
                            residents. Mr. Fukui gave no adequate explanation as to why this had not
                            been done.</p>

                            interests in China is depressing. It is true that Japan has assured the
                            United States that it has no intention to damage American interests.
                            When American property has been damaged Japan has made haste to
                            compensate the loss. Japan has expressed regrets and made apologies for
                            insults and injuries. But nevertheless it becomes increasingly plain
                            that American interests are being materially and adversely affected as
                            the Japanese military machine rolls ruthlessly and relentlessly on
                            destroying everything in its path. Witness the taking over of the
                            Chinese customs, the making of a new tariff favorable to Japanese trade,
                            the importation of Japanese goods into these areas such as kerosene and
                            rayon in North China, without payment of duties, the destruction of
                            American Mission premises, hospitals and schools in Soochow and Wusih,
                            the continued occupation of the American Baptist College at Shanghai,
                            the occupation of Tsinghua at Peiping. We evacuate our people only to
                            have them go back to businesses that have been wrecked, mission stations
                            that have been sacked, and unable to say who wrecked them as they had
                            not personally witnessed the wrecking. In many cases evacuated Americans
                                <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0272"/>tactfully refused
                            permission to return to their stations or businesses after the Japanese
                            military have completed occupation of the area and hostilities have
                            ceased. I have found it impossible to envisage any plan which might be
                            helpful in enabling Americans to resume where the present hostilities
                            have forced them to leave off. American merchants cannot hope to compete
                            with Japanese for what little business will offer when the period of
                            reconstruction begins, except of course as they may sell to Japanese.
                            American cultural enterprises which had begun to find a new place for
                            themselves in cooperation with newly founded cultural efforts of the
                            Chinese nationalism will suffer because of that cooperation and will
                            find it necessary to cooperate with the Japanese effort at suppression
                            of Chinese nationalism. The whole business of the future of American
                            interests, economic, commercial and cultural, will be so beset with
                            difficulties that many will be discouraged and quit the field.</p>

                            were located near churches, factories, and other property belonging to
                            nationals of third powers, that this proximity might result at the time
                            of attack in destruction of such property, and that, in accordance with

                            nationals of third powers, it was suggested that the Ambassador might

                            sent to Minister Foreign Affairs at 8 p.m., yesterday on receipt of

                            <p>“I have just received information from Peiping which comes from
                                Japanese military sources to the effect that Japanese scouting
                                planes which have passed over the city of Chengchow have observed
                                Chinese military trains standing in the immediate vicinity of
                                American property. I have been warned that this American property
                                will be in danger from attacks from the air if these military trains

                        <p>146. Tour 14, January 4, 6 p.m. A representative of the Mackay Radio and
                            Telegraph Company has informed the Department that the Japanese
                            authorities are shipping to Shanghai from Japan a radio transmitter
                            capable of sending messages direct from Shanghai to the United States
                            and that they expect to be able and intend to establish and maintain
                            direct commercial radio service between Shanghai and the United States
                            beginning on or about May 1, 1938.</p>
                        <p>Representatives of the Radio Corporation of America, who apparently are
                            not in close touch with the Mackay Radio and Telegraph Company, have
                            also called at the Department. They stated, amongst other things, that
                            the Radio Corporation of America had telegraphed the Director General of
                            Telegraphs and Posts in Japan urging that <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272"
                                facs="0276"/>direct commercial radio service be resumed as soon as
                            possible between Shanghai and the United States; that they have received
                            reply that direct radio service between Shanghai and the United States
                            might be resumed soon but that no definite information on the matter
                            could be given. The representatives of the Radio Corporation of America
                            indicated that some intimation from the American Government to the
                            Japanese authorities might be helpful toward a resumption of direct
                            radio service between Shanghai and the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Department desires that, unless you perceive objection, you
                            discreetly investigate the accuracy of the report that the Japanese
                            intend to establish direct commercial radio service between Shanghai and
                            the United States on or about May 1.</p>
                        <p>Please report by radio as soon as practicable.</p>

                        <p>75. Shanghai’s 257, February 14, 8 p.m.; Tokyo’s 107, February 15, 7
                            p.m.; Nanking’s 57, February 15, noon. In order to expedite a local
                            settlement of various of the issues which have arisen at Nanking upon
                            which there is substantial agreement, and in view of the disagreement in
                            regard to the adequacy of the evidence in the case under reference, the
                            Department is prepared, provided that regret is expressed over violation
                            of American Embassy property and assurances are given that there will be
                            no repetition thereof, to accept the provisional expression of regret
                            covering the desecration of the American flag in accordance with the
                            formula proposed in Shanghai’s and Tokyo’s telegrams under
                            reference.</p>
                        <p>The Department realizes the difficulty of obtaining evidence in regard to
                            desecration of the American flag additional to that which Nanking has
                            already furnished to the Japanese authorities, but in view of the
                            statement contained in Nanking’s 22, January 14, 9 a.m. that the
                            Americans reporting cases of such desecration have expressed a
                            willingness to make sworn affidavits, the Department suggests that
                            Allison endeavor to obtain such affidavits and furnish them and other
                            evidence to the Japanese authorities as a basis for their
                            investigations.</p>
                        <p>Please instruct Nanking and Shanghai in accordance with the foregoing and
                            repeat to Tokyo.</p>

                        <p>275. Reference Department’s 132, February 12, 1 p.m., and other
                            telegraphic instructions regarding losses suffered by American citizens
                            and the submission of evidence. In behalf of American citizens this
                            office has forwarded to the Japanese Consulate General a considerable
                            number of applications for passes to inspect American property located
                            at Chiaotoutseng, Changshu, Chinkiang, Changchow, Kiangyin, Liuho,
                            Quinsan and Wusih in the province of Kiangsu. In spite of persistent
                            efforts made here to obtain passes for American citizens none of these
                            applications has been acted upon because of the refusal of the Japanese
                            military authorities to permit foreigners to return to or even visit
                            their stations. In these circumstances it is practically impossible for
                            American property owners to ascertain their losses and to prepare their
                            claims.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore suggested that the refusal of the Japanese military
                            authorities to permit American citizens to inspect their properties in
                            the interior be brought to the attention of the Japanese Government with
                            the request that instructions be issued to arrange for and facilitate
                            such legitimate visits of inspection.<note n="64" xml:id="d349fn64">The

                        <p>78. Your 97, February 9, 3 p.m. With the exception of certain claims
                            arising out of the military operations at Nanking which the Japanese
                            authorities have expressed a desire to settle locally, no general

                            has been formulated, although local settlements were made directly with
                            claimants by Japanese authorities in claims arising out of bombing of
                            American Baptist Mission at Tsining on January 10 and the American Board

                                report originated, which will inform the claimant accordingly. The

                            extremely difficult. Consulate General at Hankow is now beginning to
                            receive maps from various places, but as senders of maps are not
                            ordinarily acquainted with necessary requirements to make maps
                            intelligible, many maps received are completely confusing as regards
                            location of property. Furthermore it is becoming increasingly difficult
                            to send and receive mail or telegrams in areas tributary to the
                            Consulate General at Hankow. It is obviously impossible for us or the
                            missions to prevent Chinese military from stationing themselves in the
                            vicinity of such property. In the recent bombing at Chengchow which was
                            apparently intended for the railway station, practically all bombs
                            landed on buildings railway station area including American mission
                            property without hitting railway station which is located in the very
                            center of the hotel, banking and other activities of Chengchow. Nor is
                            it possible for us to prevent use of beacons or flags by Chinese. Any
                            reply which we send to the Japanese should include a statement that
                            Japanese air forces should be instructed to make certain of objectives
                            before dropping bombs.</p>

                        <p>282. Your 146, February 16, 8 p.m. I cannot obtain definite information
                            that direct radio service with the United States will be resumed May 1
                            but Japanese appear to have told representatives of the radio companies
                            that they have transmitters en route for the purpose of direct services
                            in the near future. I have reliable information that a central receiving
                            station is in process of completion having practically the same capacity
                            as former Chinese receiving station at Liu-hong near Shanghai. Some of
                            the Chinese employees of the radio service have taken employment under
                            the Japanese. Shecklen admits that R.C.A. circuit via Manila was
                            reestablished February 12 but have found the service is slow and
                            inefficient. Traffic to the United States has fallen off heavily, due
                            partly to slow service but also to disinclination of business houses to
                            patronize a Japanese-controlled station.</p>
                        <p>2. The American, British and French companies have opened conversations
                            with the Japanese proposing revival of proposal for a neutral
                            international radio service under a neutral committee but subject to
                            Japanese censorship and other restrictions in the same manner as cables.
                            If Japanese agree, which is very doubtful, committee will then see what
                            can be done to obtain use of former equipment and personnel; consent to
                            which from Chinese side is equally doubtful.</p>

                        <p>284. The extensive and valuable property of the American Southern Baptist
                            Mission located on Paoshing Road, Chapei, was occupied by Japanese
                            troops following the withdrawal of Chinese troops from the premises in
                            October of last year.</p>
                        <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0282"/>
                        <p>Repeated written and oral representations are being made to the Japanese
                            Consulate General here to bring about the vacation of this property by
                            Japanese troops. These efforts have proved unsuccessful. In the meantime
                            members of the mission who have visited the premises from time to time
                            report continuous looting of the premises by Japanese troops who are
                            also tearing out the woodwork, breaking large holes through the walls,
                            stabling horses in the school buildings and wantonly destroying the
                            property. The property was always marked by American flags and American
                            consular notifications of ownership many of which are still to be seen
                            on the various buildings.</p>
                        <p>I am continuing my efforts here to bring about vacation of the property
                            before it is completely destroyed but suggest that strong
                            representations be made to the Japanese Government regarding this
                            particularly flagrant instance of the occupation, looting and
                            destruction of American property by Japanese troops.</p>

                        <p>65. My 54, February 12, 11 a.m. Fukui called this morning and stated he
                            had been informed that Major General Harada would call upon Mr. Gauss
                            this afternoon to express regrets for the violation of Embassy property
                            at Nanking. At the same time Mr. Fukui handed me a personal letter,
                            signed by him, stating in part, “I wish to inform you that I have made
                            an arrangement to remit the amount of United States dollars 6796 and
                            Chinese dollars 10118 to the American Consulate General in Shanghai
                            through our Consulate General there”. Mr. Fukui said that he believed
                            the payment would be made within a few days and he requested that upon
                            my being informed of the receipt of the money by the American Consul
                            General, I write him a personal letter acknowledging the receipt and
                            adding, if possible, that the incident concerning the violation of the
                            Embassy is now closed. Unless instructed to the contrary I shall give
                            Mr. Fukui such a letter at the proper time.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the requested solatium for the family of Jenkins’ servant,
                            Mr. Fukui repeated his former statement that the Japanese Army could not
                            be responsible for individual acts of violence not proved to have been
                            committed by Japanese soldiers, but he added that, because of a desire
                            not to impair the friendly relations between the <pb n="279"
                                xml:id="pg_279" facs="0283"/>United States and Japan, and because
                            the Chinese concerned was an employee of an American diplomatic officer,
                            the Japanese Government would be pleased to make a voluntary payment of
                            Chinese dollars 2500 to the family of the deceased. If this offer proves
                            satisfactory to the American Minister [<hi rend="italic"
                                >Government?</hi>], a check for the above amount will be handed the
                            American Consul General in Shanghai by the Japanese Consul General
                            there. Mr. Fukui said that no formal acknowledgment of this payment was
                            desired and that merely a receipt signed by the Consul General in
                            Shanghai would be sufficient.</p>
                        <p>I was requested to recommend that no publicity be given the expression of
                            regrets by General Harada or the payment of a solatium for Embassy
                            losses, inasmuch as it was feared that such publicity might tend to
                            inflame public opinion in both countries. I told Mr. Fukui that I could
                            only transmit his request without any recommendation.</p>
                        <p>Sent to Hankow, Peiping and Shanghai. Shanghai please repeat to
                            Tokyo.</p>

                            4, 4 p.m. Mr. Fukui gave me yesterday afternoon an official letter
                            regarding private claims for damages in which he stated <pb n="280"
                                xml:id="pg_280" facs="0284"/>that “the Japanese Government is
                            prepared to accept responsibility for damages to private property of the
                            United States of America in Nanking proved to have been caused by
                            Japanese soldiers. The Japanese Government, however, will not assume any
                            responsibility for damages resulting from military operations.”</p>

                                >Not printed.</note> Twenty Japanese censors formerly with Japanese
                            Ministry of Communications, but understood now to be under the military,
                            have taken up quarters in the main post office building in the
                            International Settlement north of Soochow Creek. Their [exact?] plans
                            are not yet known but the Director of Posts believes censorship will
                            begin very soon. The Director interprets lapse of almost 3 months since
                            first threat of postal censorship, as possible lack of [eagerness] to
                            undertake the task at Shanghai. He believes an immediate protest by
                            interested powers before censorship actually begins might receive
                            consideration at Tokyo but that any protest after censorship is
                            instituted will be too late.</p>

                                    advised that the Japanese military authorities are planning to

                                    would be an unwarranted infringement of the rights of the

                        <p>68. After a period of comparative quiet during which there were no
                            reports of violations of American property and but few reports of
                            disorders of any kind, there has recently been a recrudescence of
                            unlawful acts on the part of Japanese soldiers brought to the attention
                            of this Embassy.</p>
                        <p>During the last few days there have been reported three cases of unlawful
                            entry by Japanese soldiers of property of the University of Nanking, two
                            of which involved the forcible removal of Chinese male refugees for use
                            as laborers and rough handling and intimidation of other Chinese on the
                            premises, as well as the breaking of one or two windows by the soldiers.
                            The third case involved a group of soldiers who broke down a section of
                            the hedge surrounding the compound and took away some water stored
                            inside. These matters were all reported to the Japanese Embassy as soon
                            as possible and promises were given that such actions would not
                            continue, though two of the incidents occurred after the first complaint
                            was made. While these complaints have not been serious in themselves
                            they have shown that order has not yet been completely restored and that
                            instructions of the High Command are still flagrantly violated at
                            times.</p>
                        <p>It was reported to the office yesterday morning, by the Chinese
                            caretaker, that on the previous afternoon a Japanese soldier had broken
                            into the residence compound of the Standard Vacuum Oil Company and after
                            robbing four of the coolies there of $9 Chinese currency had demanded
                            more. When it was not forthcoming the soldiers slashed at one of the
                            coolies with his sword and when the coolie dodged, the sword cut through
                            a 2-inch bamboo flag pole on which was flying the American flag. This
                            matter was immediately called to the attention of Mr. Kasuya of the
                            Japanese Embassy, who was in the office at the time and in the afternoon
                            he accompanied Vice Consul Espy and Japanese consular and military
                            police to the spot for a personal examination of the coolies involved.
                            The most serious aspect of this incident is that the Chinese on the
                            premises have been so frightened that they may leave the compound which
                            will then have no one to guard it in any way.</p>
                        <p>Late in the afternoon I was called upon by Lieutenant Colonel Hirota and
                            Mr. Kasuya who expressed regrets at the incident and gave assurances
                            that steps were being taken to prevent any repetition. <pb n="283"
                                xml:id="pg_283" facs="0287"/>I pointed out that there was obviously
                            not enough police protection being afforded various properties and
                            Colonel Hirota said he had requested the military authorities to
                            increase the patrols in that district. I then stated that it was not
                            alone in that area but that American property in other parts of the city
                            had also been entered recently and furniture and other articles taken
                            away. I gave as an example the house of Julius Barr which on February
                            2nd had been inspected and found to have much of its furniture intact,
                            while on February 11, when inspected a second time, most of the
                            furniture was seen to have been taken away. I admitted the possibility
                            of this having been done by Chinese, who are now returning to all parts
                            of the city, but I added that there will be in the future no police
                            patrols of any sort in the vicinity of the house and that as the
                            Japanese Army was in occupation it was its responsibility to maintain
                            order and prevent such happenings.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Hirota seemed sincerely to regret these occurrences and promised
                            he would endeavor to impress upon military authorities the need of more
                            adequate police protection. He requested me not to report these matters
                            to Tokyo or Washington but I told him I must do so. However, I added I
                            would request that for the present no publicity be given to these
                            incidents unless it should become apparent that such things were
                            continuing without any real effort being made to stop them.</p>

                            some days ago, the Japanese authorities have now announced that
                            facilities will be given for the removal of foreign cargo from the
                            Chinese wharves and warehouses in question in the area north of the
                            Creek beginning March 1. This is not the end of our problems but we are
                            slowly making some headway.</p>

                            assumption that the occupying military force having seized control is

                            Hopei, together with an English translation prepared at this

                            the Consulate General is requested to notify Americans to display
                            American flags after March 20 in order that they may be given
                            appropriate protection during positive operations against the Japanese
                            which will begin on that date. The cover in which this communication was
                            received indicates that it was mailed in Tientsin although the place of
                            origin noted on the outside of the envelope is “Nanmeng Church”.</p>

                            Tientsin and only a few miles north of Pahsien District city. The
                            Consulate General has received a number of reports during the past
                            several months that representatives of the 8th Route Army were busy in
                            Pahsien and neighboring districts in an effort to organize the people
                            for guerrilla warfare against the Japanese.</p>

                                printed.</note> At the instance of the French and some others a
                            further informal meeting of representatives of Diplomatic Mission now in
                            Peiping was held yesterday afternoon to consider question of
                            extinguishing lights in Diplomatic Quarter in case of notice of an
                            impending night air raid on Peiping. The meeting as expected divulged a
                            marked difference between the Japanese and French representatives <pb
                                n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0290"/>on the subject, the former
                            favoring the extinguishing of lights, and the latter keeping the quarter
                            lighted. Both declined to yield any ground. It soon became evident that
                            there could be no unanimity on the subject. I favored the plan of
                            leaving the matter in the hands of the commandants as a purely
                            protective measure as was authorized by the meeting of February 4 but
                            since it has usually been the practice of requiring unanimity of action
                            to implement the decision of the Body it was felt that the course
                            described in my 89, February 5, 5 p.m., was no longer practicable
                            inasmuch as the French commandant was not in agreement and inasmuch as
                            the French, Dutch and Belgian representatives had at the meeting
                            yesterday expressed the view that the quarter should not be darkened.
                            The others present favored darkening the quarter, an exception being the
                            Italian representative who favored darkening the quarter if all the
                            commandants favored that course. It was finally decided that the
                            situation existing before the question first arose should be restored
                            whereupon I made it plain that I could not assume the responsibility of
                            authorizing the senior commandant either to darken the entire quarter or

                        <p>347. Your 176, February 28, 6 p.m. I have done what I could to urge upon
                            the Japanese authorities the need for improved radio service with the
                            United States and have asked for earnest consideration of the recent
                            proposal for committee management. There is nothing more that I can do
                            here and I do not believe there is anything that can be done elsewhere
                            now in the matter. As the Department is aware from my several messages,
                            the failure of early proposals on the committee <pb n="287"
                                xml:id="pg_287" facs="0291"/>managed international radio service was
                            due to the opposition and refusal of Shecklen, the R.C.A.
                            representative, to support the proposals and his attempt to put the
                            Chinese Government radio service under the protection of the American
                            flag. I learn unofficially that the Japanese have told Shecklen and
                            representatives of other radio interests that the reply to the proposal
                            now made for committee management will be in the negative. I also learn
                            that the Japanese are now working on the installation of additional
                            transmitting equipment.</p>

                        <p>98. Your 132, February 28, 10 a.m. If claimants desire to file claims of

                            in paragraph 7th of the Department’s 78, February 18, 7 p.m. However,
                            should responsibility be admitted with respect to particular incidents
                            and a desire be manifested by the authorities to settle such claims
                            locally and informally, the procedure set out in paragraph 4th may be
                            followed. In claims of this character claimants’ attention may be
                            invited to the following considerations: <list>
                                <item>First: While it is a general principle of international law
                                    that a government is obligated to take all reasonable steps
                                    necessary to protect the property of aliens within its
                                    jurisdiction, a government is not ordinarily regarded as
                                    internationally responsible for losses sustained by aliens as a
                                    result of the acts of private individuals in the absence of
                                    evidence of complicity or neglect on the part of its
                                    authorities.</item>
                                <item>Second: In situations in which military forces have occupied
                                    and are in control of a particular area their responsibility in
                                    the matter of protecting the property of aliens against acts of
                                    private individuals <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0292"/>is
                                    not believed to be any greater than that which would have
                                    normally rested upon the regular civil authorities who were
                                    supplanted.</item>
                                <item>Third: In claims of this character claimants should endeavor
                                    to establish either (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that the
                                    authorities were put on notice with respect to, or reasonably
                                    should have anticipated the occurrence of, illegal acts of the
                                    nature complained of, and negligently failed to take adequate
                                    steps to prevent the acts; or (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) that
                                    the authorities negligently failed to take adequate steps to
                                    apprehend and punish the offenders. It should also be shown, if
                                    possible, that sufficient police or soldiers were available to
                                    prevent the acts had the authorities been disposed to take steps
                                    to that end.</item>

                        <p>It is pointed out that since Japanese occupation of this area
                            missionaries have been denied access to mission property and that during
                            their enforced absence nearly all buildings have been looted and damaged
                            and some destroyed by fire. Secretary of State is therefore petitioned: <list>

                                <item>To make formal protest to the Japanese Government against the

                            </list></p>
                        <p>With the petition is enclosed a list showing that American mission
                            property at the followed named places is occupied at the present time by

                                <p>“1. General conditions in Nanking have improved considerably in
                                    [recent] weeks. Chinese from refugee zone have been returning to
                                    their homes and spreading through the city. Small Chinese and
                                    Japanese shops have been opening. Missionaries report that
                                    number of known cases of rape and of assault by soldiers upon
                                    civilian population has been reduced to 2 or 3 daily of each
                                    category. About 200 unarmed Chinese police are on duty
                                    throughout the city and postal service is scheduled to resume
                                    March 24.</p>
                                <p>2. Nanking is apparently being used both for garrison purposes
                                    and as a rest camp, and with present garrison personnel the
                                    problem of maintaining order centers chiefly in new troops
                                    coming from the field. Recently this difficulty appears to have

                                <p>3. The new Japanese Consul General seems also well disposed,
                                    Japanese officials I met were friendly and it was obvious that
                                    there exists a cordial and friendly relationship between them
                                    and Allison and Espy. (Both their duties and the conditions
                                    under which they live have imposed considerable strain upon
                                    Embassy staff. There is yet no telephone service, electric light
                                    service is not continuous and water service is only
                                    occasional.)</p>

                                <p>4. While life in Nanking is far from normal, general improvement
                                    in conditions inclines me to recommend that Japanese authorities
                                    be pressed to lessen restrictions against return of American
                                    missionaries and business men who have important interests
                                    there. Following is from letter addressed to the Embassy March 9
                                    by missionaries representing present Nanking American community:
                                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>‘It seems to us that there is now no good reason why the
                                            Japanese should seek to place any restrictions on the
                                            presence or movement of American nationals in Nanking.
                                            Three months have elapsed since the occupation of the
                                            city, and there is at this time no conceivable danger
                                            which would of itself make it unwise for Americans to
                                            reside there. The present restrictions may possibly have
                                            been justified in the early days immediately following
                                            the occupation, but there is no reason for them now.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, in addition to the fact that there is no
                                            reason why American citizens should longer be kept out
                                            of Nanking, there are also certain definite and positive
                                            reasons why they should return. In the first place,
                                            their return is needed in order to assess properly the
                                            damages to American property recently occasioned by
                                            Japanese soldiers. Only the various owners or persons
                                            responsible for such property can file satisfactory
                                            statements in regard thereto. But of even more
                                            importance than this is the fact that additional workers
                                            are needed to meet the great humanitarian needs which
                                            the present emergency has thrust upon us. Those who are
                                            now available for this task are all too few, and various
                                            matters, especially public health, have been already far
                                            too long neglected. Again, apart from the relief work,
                                            there are the regular tasks of business, mission, or
                                            other enterprises, which those concerned therewith
                                            naturally desire to carry forward at the first
                                            opportunity. Finally, there is the obvious fact that the
                                            Open Door—a vital principle to our Government—can be
                                            kept open only if a sufficient number of Americans (and
                                            other foreign nationals) stay by their jobs and keep it
                                            from being shut. Thus taken together all these reasons
                                            combine to make a strong case for seeking the immediate
                                            removal of the restrictions that now prevail.’”</p>

                        <p>76. Shanghai’s 390, March 14, 2 p.m. With regard to paragraph 4 of
                            Shanghai’s telegram under reference it should be reported that in an
                            informal conversation with a Japanese official yesterday I mentioned the
                            matter of Americans returning to Nanking and stated that I believed a
                            good impression would be created if the Japanese would announce that
                            foreigners who had formerly lived or had business interests in Nanking
                            would be permitted to return. This official agreed but stated that at
                            present there were 2 objections: First, the local military authorities
                            are very sensitive to criticism and have been much disturbed at reports
                            which have been sent abroad by Nanking foreigners as to conditions here
                            and they therefore hesitate to allow any more foreigners to come to the
                            city; second, from a purely military viewpoint it is believed that
                            conditions are not yet such as to permit of foreigners returning. It was
                            stated that the Japanese must take Hankow before foreigners can be
                            permitted freely to return to Nanking and normal shipping services
                            resumed on the Yangtze. I pointed out that Americans had a right to live
                            in China and that the American Government had not admitted the right of
                            the Japanese to prevent Americans returning to their homes here but that
                            up to the present there had been no desire to make an issue of the
                            matter. I added that it might soon be necessary to do so, however, and
                            that in view of Japan’s oft stated friendship for the United States and
                            the recent statements in the Japanese Diet by Foreign Minister Hirota
                            that foreign rights and interests were to be respected, I hoped that no
                            impediment would be placed in the way of Americans returning in the not
                            too distant future.</p>
                        <p>Sent to Embassy, Hankow. Repeated to Peiping and Shanghai. Shanghai
                            please repeat to Tokyo. If Shanghai’s 390 has not been repeated to
                            Tokyo, I suggest that they do so.</p>

                        <p>175. Various Japanese have shown a lively interest lately in the Fan
                            Biological Institute at Peiping, which was built with American remitted
                            Boxer Indemnity funds and which is supported by the China Foundation. No
                            Americans are at present directly connected with the Institute. The
                            Institute has now received a letter from the North China Affairs Bureau
                            of the South Manchuria Railway Company stating that the Institute is
                            suitable as a residence and that a company representative will discuss
                            with the Institute procedure and conditions for purchase. The Institute
                            has replied that it does not wish to sell. In view of the possibility of
                            pressure being brought to bear on the staff of the Institute, does the
                            Department have any objection to my orally informing the Japanese
                            Embassy of the American financial assistance to the Institute and to
                            expressing the hope that no action will be taken by the Japanese which
                            might adversely affect it? Please expedite reply.</p>

                            <p>“Tokyo March 20, 1938. My dear Ambassador: According to the recent
                                report from the commander of a large number of Japanese warships
                                anchored in the vicinity of the Manshan Islands, which lie at the
                                head of Canton Bay, for the purpose of blocking communications along
                                the coast of South China, on March 11, at about 3:30 P.M., a flying
                                boat (high winged monoplane) proceeding from the direction of Hong
                                Kong flew over the Manshan Islands toward Macao. It was concluded
                                from the appearance of the machine and from the course it was flying
                                that it was a commercial machine, and, therefore, the Japanese
                                warships and airplanes did not attack it. Further, it was
                                ascertained from subsequent investigations that the machine was an
                                airplane belonging to the Pan American Airways.</p>
                            <p>However, according to most recent reports received by the Japanese
                                Government, Chinese airplanes are frequently active in the vicinity
                                of Canton, and, consequently, the Japanese Navy cannot neglect
                                preparations for ordinary offensive operations. British airplanes in
                                Hong Kong are for the present refraining from flying over the
                                vicinity of the Manshan Islands. In view of the possibility that,
                                due to flights over such area by airplanes of the Pan American
                                Airways, some unfortunate error involving the Japanese Navy might
                                occur, I have the honor to request that measures be urgently taken
                                with a view to flights over the Manshan Islands not being undertaken
                                for the time being.”</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s telegram No. 78 of February 18, 7:00 p.m., to the Embassy
                            at Hankow (repeated to this office by the Embassy’s circular of February
                            21, 4:00 p.m.) concerning the procedure for handling claims resulting
                            from the present Chinese-Japanese hostilities, and to the Department’s
                            telegram No. 45 of March 11, 6:00 p.m., to this office authorizing me to
                            furnish informally to the Japanese Consulate General a list of the
                            losses of American property in this consular district for which
                            indemnity has not been received.</p>
                        <p>I enclose a copy of the list which was informally transmitted to a
                            Japanese consular officer under cover of a personal letter dated March
                            23, 1938, a copy of which is also enclosed,<note n="90"
                                xml:id="d387fn90">Enclosures not printed.</note> and which covers
                            all unsettled losses known to this office on March 22, 1938.</p>

                        <p>Claims of the several categories specified in the Department’s
                            instruction to the Embassy at Hankow have been grouped together in the
                            list, but this grouping has not been indicated in the copy of the list
                            supplied to the Japanese Consulate General. The losses on pages 1 and 2
                            of the list, numbered 1 to 32, inclusive, totalling US$102,385.24,
                            appear to have been due to looting by irregular troops and civilians.
                            The losses on pages 3 and 4 of the list, numbered from 33 to 54,
                            inclusive, and on the supplementary list, totalling US$32,516.72, seem
                            to have been due directly to Japanese troops. The losses on page 5 of
                            the list, numbered 55 to 59, inclusive, totalling US$9,595.19, were
                            caused by the regular Chinese military and authorities. The
                            responsibility for the losses on pages 6 and 7 of the list, numbered 60
                            to 84, inclusive, totalling US$38,980.69, has not been determined; it is
                            probable that in at least some of the cases in this fourth category the
                            losses were due to the actions of more than one of the groups
                            responsible for the losses in the first three categories.</p>
                        <p>Copies of this despatch are being sent to the American Embassies at
                            Hankow and Tokyo.</p>

                                Japanese-sponsored regime at Peiping.</note> informed foreign press
                            correspondents at 10 o’clock this morning that several “ruffians”
                            (reportedly six Chinese) fired several shots at his motorcar last
                            evening at 6:20 o’clock, that he escaped uninjured, that his Japanese
                            private secretary was wounded in the arm and face and that the
                            assailants escaped on bicycles. Other reports of the incident are
                            approximately the same. The incident occurred in the Chinese city at a
                            corner of Hatamen Street.</p>
                        <p>2. As a result of the attack a search for the assailants was instituted
                            throughout the Chinese city and Japanese gendarmes and Chinese municipal
                            police were stationed for some hours at gates of the Legation quarter,
                            without authority [of?] the Legation quarter authorities, and searched
                            passers-by and stopped motorcars for investigation, including some cars
                            of Diplomatic Missions. (A British Embassy car was stopped inside one
                            gate.) These police have been continuing their search this morning but
                            at points outside the glacis where Chinese municipal police jurisdiction
                            exists.</p>

                        <p>3. As representative of the senior protocol Embassy, I called on the
                            Japanese First Secretary this morning and informed him that the
                            stationing of Japanese and/or Chinese municipal police on Legation
                            quarter property and the stopping and investigating of motor vehicles of
                            Diplomatic Missions was without legal basis, that the control and
                            administration of the Legation quarter was in the hands of the Legion
                            quarter authorities. The Secretary replied that he understood these
                            points but that the Japanese miltitary had been greatly excited by the
                            attempted assassination. I replied that no matter how serious the
                            incident, any measures taken affecting the Legation quarter should be
                            taken only by the Legation quarter authorities. I requested the
                            Secretary to inform the Japanese authorities responsible for the
                            stationing of the police on Legation quarter property of the foregoing
                            views. He replied that he would comply with my request. He also said
                            that there is no proof that the assailants have taken refuge in the
                            Legation quarter.</p>

                        <p>87. Department’s 225, March 23, 7 p.m., to Shanghai. During the past 10
                            days an effort has been made to make arrangements for 2 doctors and 2
                            nurses to come to Nanking from Shanghai as well as for American citizens
                            in Nanking to make business trips to Shanghai and return, but with
                            little success. I was informed this morning by the Japanese Consul
                            General that the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai, with whom
                            the matter had been taken up, stated that for the time being they did
                            not consider it advisable for foreigners to come to Nanking. The
                            Japanese military take the stand that if anything should happen to
                            foreigners in Nanking they would be morally responsible and they do not
                            wish to take a risk. As for Americans already in Nanking desiring to
                            make visits to Shanghai and return, it was said that this would probably
                            be possible soon but no definite date was set when such trips could be
                            made.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that no progress can be made in this matter locally and
                            that it will be necessary to press the matter in Shanghai and Tokyo if
                            anything is to be accomplished. The following facts, all of which have
                            been brought to the attention of the local Japanese authorities, are
                            presented for possible use in any representations which may be made.</p>
                        <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0304"/>
                        <p>According to the Japanese Consul General himself, there are at present
                            approximately 600 Japanese citizens in Nanking. This number, which is
                            believed to be far greater than before the opening of hostilities,
                            includes a considerable number of women and children. There are at least
                            13 shops of various kinds in Nanking operated by Japanese, which sell to
                            Chinese and foreigners and cannot be classified as shops for military
                            purposes. Announcements and price lists of these shops have been printed
                            from time to time in the small local newspaper which is published
                            through arrangement with the special section of the Japanese Army.
                            Japanese ships make trips from Shanghai to Nanking every 5 days and
                            while the Japanese authorities claim these ships only bring military
                            supplies it has been noticed that supplies for these various shops
                            mentioned above are sometimes included in the cargo and it is known that
                            Japanese and some Chinese civilians have made trips back and forth in
                            these ships. Japanese and Chinese civilians now also make trips to
                            Shanghai from time to time in the military train which now makes daily
                            runs between the two cities. One Japanese trucking company alone has 40
                            trucks operating on the road between here and Shanghai.</p>
                        <p>It would appear from the above that there is ground for the belief that
                            discrimination is being shown and that American and other foreign rights
                            and interests are not being given the consideration promised in the
                            various statements in the Diet made by the Japanese Premier and Foreign
                            Minister. With regard to the Japanese claim that Nanking is still
                            dangerous it should be pointed out that while Chinese air raids have
                            taken place from time to time, the Chinese have scrupulously avoided
                            flying over the center of the city and few if any foreigners have seen
                            even a single Chinese plane. Order within the city has greatly improved
                            and the danger to foreigners, if any, is extremely slight.</p>

                        <p>199. At the request of the Ambassador the following two telegrams are
                            quoted: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“March 30, 11 a.m.</p>
                                <p>1. The Japanese Embassy has asked the French Embassy for
                                    permission to use the French glacis on April 6th for a review of
                                    3,000 <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0305"/>‘Self Defense
                                    Corps’ young Chinese men. Yaguchi of the Japanese Embassy states
                                    that the young men are not soldiers and do not carry arms and
                                    that the review will be neither military nor political in
                                    character. The Corps will be reviewed by Japanese officers not
                                    of the Embassy guard.</p>
                                <p>2. The French commandant gave permission for the French glacis to
                                    be used. That permission has now been suspended and will
                                    probably be retracted. The French claim that due to poor
                                    interpreting the French commandant did not realize that officers
                                    other than Embassy guard officers were to participate. Lacoste
                                    contends that the review is political in character. If the
                                    French definitely refuse permission they will probably raise the
                                    question of whether objection should be made to the review being
                                    held on the Japanese glacis.</p>
                                <p>2 [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. I have told Lacoste that my
                                    personal view is that it would be inadvisable to make an issue
                                    of the matter inasmuch as (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the
                                    Japanese state that the review is neither military nor political

                                    is not composed of soldiers and is armed only with wooden

                                    advanced (for example, General Terauchi held a press conference
                                    at the Embassy), (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) unanimity of view on

                                <p>3. I should appreciate your instruction as to what the Embassy’s
                                    attitude should be in case the French make an issue of the
                                    question.</p>
                                <p>4. I understand that the British Embassy here holds views similar

                            Consulate General, to obtain the evacuation of Japanese forces from the

                            the property was resulting from military occupation and lack of care and
                            by reason of major unrepaired damage to roofs, and that nearly 6 million

                            the University property with compensation for damages sustained and

                        <p>486. Reference Department’s No. 226, March 23, 8 p.m., regarding Japanese
                            military occupation of American mission property and restrictions upon
                            return of Americans to mission stations. From discussions with Hidaka,
                            the new Japanese Consul General, I learn that he has been conferring
                            with the Japanese military and he says that he has been able to obtain
                            their “agreement in principle” to evacuation of American property and
                            return of Americans to their stations but it is apparent from his
                            statements that there will be difficulty and delay in applying the
                            principle and therefore little progress may be expected in the near
                            future. Constant pressure will be needed both here and in Tokyo.</p>

                        <p>90. My 87, March 29, 4 p.m. In the telegram under reference it was
                            reported that the Japanese Consul General had stated it would probably
                            soon be possible for American citizens to make business trips to
                            Shanghai and return. Two American citizens, Professor M. S. Bates of the
                            University of Nanking and Reverend Ernest Forster of the American Church
                            Mission, were informed yesterday afternoon by Mr. Tanaka of the Japanese
                            Consulate General that arrangements had been made for them to go to
                            Shanghai on a Japanese ship leaving <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303"
                                facs="0307"/>here April 3. However, a pass will be issued good only
                            for travel from Nanking to Shanghai and it would be necessary to apply
                            to the Japanese military in Shanghai for a pass to return which it was
                            said would be granted. According to Mr. Bates, he was told that the
                            Japanese military were dissatisfied with the conduct in Shanghai of
                            foreigners who had previously come from Nanking and that the local
                            Consulate General had been asked to see to it that any other foreigners
                            coming to Shanghai be very careful about their conduct while in the
                            city. It was said that if the conduct of Mr. Bates and Mr. Forster was
                            not satisfactory it might be difficult for them to return to Nanking.
                            Upon being asked to explain, Mr. Tanaka stated that other foreigners had
                            spread anti-Japanese propaganda regarding the sitution in Nanking and he
                            advised Mr. Bates to be very careful during his stay. He was
                            particularly advised against talking to newspaper men or at least saying
                            things which might be published and which the military tribunal [<hi
                                rend="italic">would</hi>] consider injurious to the army. It would
                            also be necessary for Mr. Bates and Mr. Forster to give their Shanghai
                            addresses and to state how long they wished to remain in the city.</p>
                        <p>I called on Consul General Hanawa this morning and made an informal
                            protest against these conditions being placed upon the travel of
                            Americans and also at what seemed to me to be an unwarranted attempt of
                            the Japanese military to assume control over American citizens. Mr.
                            Hanawa stated that Mr. Tanaka had only been giving friendly advice and
                            that there were no “conditions”. I then asked why, if there were no
                            conditions, it was not possible to give a pass good for the round trip
                            rather than only a one way pass, and Mr. Hanawa replied that the
                            military in Nanking could not give such a pass. I pointed out that the
                            military in Wuhu had given a round trip pass to an American citizen
                            about a month ago for a trip to Shanghai and that it seemed strange that
                            the Nanking military could not do the same thing. I stated that while
                            technically there might be no conditions to the granting of these
                            passes, inasmuch as a round trip pass was not issued, the practical
                            result was the same as if conditions had been made. I added that neither
                            Mr. Bates nor Mr. Forster was going to Shanghai to make anti-Japanese
                            propaganda but that in the course of their work it might be necessary
                            for them to make factual statements regarding Nanking conditions and
                            that it was not right that they should be penalized if some of their
                            statements proved displeasing to the Japanese military. I concluded by
                            saying that if these Americans were prevented from returning to Nanking
                            I should be inclined to take a serious view of the matter.</p>
                        <p>It is apparent that the real reason for military restrictions upon the
                            travel of foreigners between Shanghai and Nanking is the fear that the
                            truth will be told concerning Japanese activities here rather than
                            solicitude for the safety of foreigners as has been claimed. I believe
                                <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0308"/>it would be beneficial if
                            the Embassy at some future date could make informal representations
                            against this attitude of the Japanese military in Shanghai which so
                            greatly hinders the legitimate activities of American citizens.</p>
                        <p>Sent to Embassy, Hankow, repeated to Department, Peiping and Shanghai.
                            Shanghai please repeat to Tokyo.</p>

                                        taken by the third powers have proven insufficient, the
                                        Japanese Embassy earnestly hope that the representatives of

                                merely as a “copy” of what was being sent to the other Missions
                                inasmuch as the American Embassy had responded so adequately to the

                                Tobacco Company, Limited (B. A. T.—British registered) informed the
                                Embassy April 11th in confidence that his firm expects within the
                                next day or two to sign a contract with a representative of the
                                Federal Reserve Bank and a Japanese officer for the purchase with
                                foreign currency of Federal Reserve Bank notes totaling $9,000,000
                                for the purpose of buying tobacco in Shantung through the firm’s

                                adequate protection by the Japanese military of the company’s buyers
                                at four specified points on the Tsingtao–Tsinanfu Railway, that
                                notes totaling $1,000,000 are to be purchased immediately, and that
                                subsequent purchases will be contingent upon the adequacy of the
                                protection given by the Japanese military. The Embassy’s informant
                                stated that although the buying season is usually over by the end of
                                February the condition of the tobacco will be satisfactory if
                                purchase of the present harvested crop be completed before July 2.
                                The firm’s buyers are to proceed to the railway stations of the four
                                specified towns and are to reside in the stations, if necessary,
                                under the protection of Japanese military. The official of the firm
                                stated that he was fully cognizant of the possible danger to the
                                buyers from guerrilla operations and that the firm does not propose
                                to have its employees take unreasonable risks. He suggested that the
                                American Consul at Tsingtao be directed to ask the Japanese
                                authorities prior to the departure of the American buyers to afford
                                adequate protection to them.</item>

                        <p>206. Peiping’s 226, April 12, 5 p.m., paragraph 3. In view of our
                            attitude in regard to American citizens visiting areas that are
                            dangerous, and particularly in view of the fact that in this case
                            Americans in question are cooperating indirectly with, and ask directly
                            the protection of, one party to present hostilities in area that is very
                            much <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0313"/>disturbed, and considering
                            that activities in question could not be carried out by these Americans
                            except under the armed protection of one of the parties to the present
                            hostilities, it is my opinion that American Consul at Tsingtao should be
                            instructed to warn American citizens that they proceed at their own risk
                            and that he should refrain from requesting Japanese military protection
                            for purposes indicated.</p>

                        <p>93. An article appearing in yesterday’s issue of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Nanking Min Pao</hi> states that according to information received
                            from the Japanese Consulate General the number of Japanese residents in
                            Nanking on March 31st was 810, there being 420 males and 390 females. As
                            statement was also made regarding the types of business engaged in by
                            the Japanese which shows there are 45 different occupations including
                            following: flour mill, architect, theater, insurance, printing,
                            electrical supplies, photographic supplies, physicians, transportation,
                            pharmacist, foodstuff supplies, hotel, restaurant, tea shops, wine and
                            spirits dealers, and toilet supplies.</p>
                        <p>While restrictions on movements of foreigners in this area are being
                            loosened to some extent, as evidenced by Shanghai’s 536, April 14, 9

                            will be permitted to return either to close up former activities no
                            longer profitable or to resume business. It is believed that unless some
                            special stand is taken, by the time American and other foreign
                            businessmen are allowed to return, they will find their former fields of

                        <p>Mr. Ballantine took occasion, when Mr. Suma called in connection with
                            another matter, to bring up the question of permission for Americans to
                            return to Nanking and Soochow. Mr. Ballantine informed Mr. Suma
                            substantially as follows:</p>
                        <p>American residents who had formerly lived or had business interests in
                            Nanking or at Soochow have experienced considerable difficulty in
                            obtaining permission from the Japanese military authorities <pb n="311"
                                xml:id="pg_311" facs="0315"/>to enable them to return to these
                            places. Four months have now elapsed since the Japanese entry into these
                            cities, and our reports indicate that there is at this time no element
                            of danger which would of itself make it unwise for Americans to reside
                            there. These Americans have regular tasks of business, mission and other
                            enterprises, which they naturally desire to resume at the first
                            opportunity. With regard to Consul Allison’s representation at Nanking,
                            the Japanese military have taken the stand that if anything should
                            happen to foreigners at Nanking the Japanese military would be morally
                            responsible and they do not wish to take the risk. On the other hand,
                            there are over eight hundred Japanese civilians now residing in Nanking
                            and they have taken up various types of business in the city. Naturally,
                            if Japanese civilians are residing in Nanking and Soochow in large
                            numbers and Americans are prevented from returning, it will tend to
                            produce a very unfavorable effect in this country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Suma said he would take up the matter with his Government.</p>

                            of March to return to Soochow have just returned to Shanghai at the
                            request of the Japanese military authorities in Soochow. The latter
                            informed them that military reasons necessitated this request which it
                            was stated was made upon instructions received from the higher military
                            authorities in Shanghai.</p>

                        <p>The missionaries concerned described the situation in Soochow as
                            ominously tense because of the presence of large Chinese guerrilla units
                            outside the city, the rumored presence of several thousand guerrillas
                            inside the city and a greatly reduced Japanese garrison; they expressed
                            the opinion that the tense situation prevailing in and around Soochow
                            made the request of the military authorities not unreasonable.</p>

                            refer to your letter of April 26, 1938, transmitting a memorandum in
                            response to the memorandum handed to Consul General Okamoto by Consul
                            General Gauss on January 18, 1938.<note n="5" xml:id="d408fn5">None
                                printed.</note> The latter memorandum pointed out that the
                            Consolidated Taxes are security for the cotton, wheat and flour credits
                            granted to China in 1931 and 1933 by agencies of the United States
                            Government and reserved the right to hold the Japanese authorities
                            accountable for any actions by persons nominated, appointed or acting at
                            the instance or under the direction of the Japanese military or other
                            authorities disregardful of American interests in the matter.</p>
                        <p>I have forwarded a copy of your memorandum to the Department of State,
                            but feel that I must point out that it appears to me that your
                            contention that the principal and interest of the cotton, wheat and
                            flour credits of 1931 and 1933 have been and are being paid out of the
                            Chinese Customs Revenue has no direct bearing on the matter.</p>
                        <p>This office is not informed whether all or any part of the payments have
                            been made from the Chinese Customs Revenues but, in case they have been
                            made therefrom, the fact remains unchanged that, although also secured
                            on the five percent flood relief customs surtax, the consolidated
                            obligation of the Chinese Government held by the Export-Import Bank of
                            Washington, D. C., is primarily secured upon the consolidated taxes and
                            becomes immediately due and payable in full from either or both these
                            revenues at the option of the Export-Import Bank of Washington if any
                            installment of principal or interest on the consolidated obligation is
                            not paid promptly when due.</p>
                        <p>I must therefore insist that no action shall be taken or countenanced by
                            the Japanese authorities in the areas from which the legitimate <pb
                                n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0317"/>Chinese authorities have
                            withdrawn which fails adequately to take into account the aforementioned
                            obligation to the Export-Import Bank of Washington, and I take this
                            opportunity to reassert that the right to hold the Japanese authorities
                            accountable for action disregardful of American interests in the matter
                            is fully reserved.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Suma referred to Mr. Ballantine’s conversation with him of April
                                18<note n="7" xml:id="d411fn7">Memorandum of conversation not

                            Japanese military of the property of the University of Shanghai. Mr.
                            Suma said that following that conversation the Embassy had telegraphed
                                <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0318"/>the Foreign Office and
                            urged, in view of the wide interest throughout this country in the
                            University, that this matter be given prompt attention. Mr. Suma said
                            that a reply had now been received from the Foreign Office to the effect
                            that it had taken this matter up with the military authorities, who
                            indicated to the Foreign Office that the Japanese army desired to
                            purchase the property belonging to the University and were taking up the
                            matter with the American representatives of the University at Shanghai.
                            Mr. Ballantine expressed surprise and said that he had not heard of such
                            an approach by the Japanese military authorities to the representatives
                            of the mission and he would therefore make inquiries regarding this
                            point. He asked Mr. Suma, however, whether in the event that the mission
                            did not wish to sell the Japanese military authorities would vacate the
                            property. Mr. Suma did not have any comments to make on this point. Mr.
                            Suma said, however, in this general connection that the Japanese
                            military had indicated that they would vacate by the end of May the
                            property belonging to a Baptist mission school near Chapei.</p>

                        <p>639. Department’s 226, March 23, 8 p.m., regarding the refusal of the
                            Japanese authorities to permit Americans to proceed to points in the
                            interior in connection with missionary or business activities.</p>
                        <p>In spite of repeated representations made to local Japanese authorities
                            very little progress has been made in obtaining passes for American
                            missionaries to visit or return to their mission stations. <pb n="315"
                                xml:id="pg_315" facs="0319"/>During April passes were obtained for 1
                            missionary to return to Sung-kiang and 2 to Soochow. However, the latter
                            were subsequently requested by the Japanese military to leave on the
                            plea that conditions there were unsafe. As regards Nanking, passes for 2
                            doctors and 2 nurses were obtained from the Japanese military
                            authorities but it has been impossible to obtain any additional passes
                            for American missionaries desirous of returning to Nanking or to other
                            cities.</p>
                        <p>With reference to return of American businessmen to the interior, the
                            situation is even more unsatisfactory. Applications have been made for
                            passes in behalf of several large American firms to permit their men to
                            return either for purposes of brief inspection and the checking of
                            losses or for the reopening of their respective businesses. The attitude
                            of the local Japanese authorities is set forth in a letter dated April
                            27 from the Japanese Consul General in reply to representations made
                            regarding the reopening and reoccupation by the Standard Oil Company of
                            its installation at Chinkiang, Nanking, and Wuhu. The Japanese Consul
                            General stated that, “I regret to state that I have not been advised by
                            our military authorities to inform you that peace and order in and
                            around the above-mentioned places are restored to such an extent as to
                            enable them to comply with the request of the said company.” Actually
                            conditions in the cities to which Americans seek to return are
                            sufficiently tranquil although Chinese guerrillas are active in the
                            surrounding countryside. Furthermore many Japanese merchants and their
                            families are to be found in all such places.</p>
                        <p>This whole question is becoming increasingly urgent, firstly, because
                            several missionary properties at Soochow, Liuho, Changshu, Wusih, and
                            Yangchow have been vacated as the result of recent Japanese troop
                            transfers and the missionary societies concerned are extremely anxious
                            to despatch representatives to reoccupy and preserve such properties
                            and, secondly, because American trade is likely to be seriously affected
                            by continued Japanese refusal to permit American merchants to resume
                            their activities or even to make visits of inspection and take steps to
                            prevent further deterioration of stocks and equipment.</p>
                        <p>I am continuing to press the Japanese authorities here having discussed
                            the whole question at length yesterday with the Counselor and First
                            Secretary of the Japanese Embassy but it appears to me to be desired
                            that further representations be made to the Japanese Government.</p>

                        <p>During the hostilities which took place at Shanghai last year, several
                            properties of Netherlands subjects suffered damage through bombardment,
                            etc. These Netherlands subjects have now requested the Netherlands
                            Government to claim for them compensation for sustained losses and
                            damages of the Japanese and Chinese Governments. The Netherlands
                            Government however is of the opinion that various questions arise in
                            this connection.</p>
                        <p>First of all the question arises whether sufficient legal grounds can be
                            found for the claiming of these losses and damages considering they
                            resulted from warlike acts committed by the Japanese and Chinese
                            armies.</p>
                        <p>If in these cases the view is held that the damages resulted from acts of
                            war, the Hague Convention respecting the laws and usages of war on land
                            and the thereto annexed regulation should be considered applicable.<note

                                    target="frus1907p2#pg_1211">1211</ref>.</note> Article 23 of
                            this regulation rules that the destruction and seizure of enemy
                            possessions is prohibited except in cases when such destruction or
                            seizures are imperatively required by the necessities of war. As it is
                            generally accepted that neutrals cannot claim a better treatment as far
                            as their properties are concerned as nationals <pb n="317"
                                xml:id="pg_317" facs="0321"/>of the enemy country, it seems that in
                            this case compensation could only be claimed if it could be proved that
                            the damage resulted from “indiscriminate, wanton or general destruction”
                            or “gross negligence”.</p>
                        <p>It naturally depends upon the circumstances of every specific case
                            whether this has actually been the case.</p>
                        <p>If however the hostilities in China should not be regarded as acts of war
                            in view of the fact that war has not been formally declared, the
                            question arises whether the fighting parties can be held responsible for
                            the sustained losses in question. At first sight it seems very difficult
                            to find a legal basis for the claiming of damages which so directly
                            resulted from military acts perpetrated in the territory of one State by
                            the regular army of that State and/or by the invading army of another
                            State, unless the claim be based on the fact that the damages resulted
                            from acts committed by Japan or China in disregard of international law
                            and for that reason one of these States would be held responsible for
                            all the damages in question.</p>
                        <p>It however is extremely doubtful that the Japanese and Chinese
                            Governments would ever be prepared to assume such a responsibility.
                            Still—if the information received is correct—it seems that at the outset
                            of the “incident” the United States, British and French Governments
                            declared to hold the Japanese Government responsible for all losses
                            sustained by their respective nationals resulting from the above
                            mentioned hostilities.</p>
                        <p>As the Netherlands Government however is not sure that this information
                            is correct it should highly appreciate to be informed whether such a
                            declaration has indeed been made by the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>Moreover still another question arises in this connection, i. e. whether
                            the properties in question which suffered damages, can be deemed to
                            actually belong to Netherlands (and foreign) subjects, since real estate
                            located outside the International and French concessions can not be
                            owned by foreigners. In practice this difficulty was overcome by having
                            the respective properties registered at the Chinese Law Office in the
                            name of one or other Chinese who held the property “in trust” for the
                            actual owner. Although this question is of no avail in case the view is
                            held that the damages resulted from acts of war considering that in a
                            formal war, as pointed out above, neutral properties are not in a more
                            favorable position than properties belonging to nationals of the enemy
                            country, the difference in nationality of the actual owners might be of
                            importance in case other rules should be held applicable than those of
                            the Hague Convention respecting the laws and usages of war on land.</p>
                        <p>As undoubtedly many cases have occurred in which properties of American
                            subjects have suffered damage resulting from the above referred <pb
                                n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0322"/>to hostilities, the Netherlands
                            Government should be most interested and appreciative to learn if
                            possible which line of action the United States Government is taking in
                            this matter.</p>

                        <p>One hundred American nationals (43 men, 53 women, 4 children) are now in
                            this consular district, 63 of whom (including self and naval radio-man)
                            are in Foochow, remaining 37 being distributed among interior points as
                            follows: Chungan 1, Diongloh 2, Futsing 3, Ingtai 3, Kiehnow 8, Kienyang
                            1, Kutien 5, Mintsing 2, Nanping 3, Pucheng 1, Putien 5, Shangowu 1,
                            Sienku 2.</p>
                        <p>If and when attack on Foochow begins, river barrier will probably be
                            closed, making evacuation of Americans then here impossible. Some
                            Americans might be willing to leave before beginning of the attack, but
                            great majority will doubtless refuse to go.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore very desirable that Tsangchienshan, the area in which
                            majority of the foreigners in Foochow live, should, in case of attack on
                            the city, be regarded by both combatants as a temporary safety zone. If
                            recognition of this fact on the part of the Japanese command and of
                            local military authorities could be assured in advance (without implying
                            any abatement of the obligation to respect American lives and property
                            wherever they may be) it would be feasible to concentrate as many
                            Americans in that area as could be prevailed upon to leave their present
                            posts.</p>
                        <p>British Consul to whom I informally broached the subject yesterday
                            appears to be in full agreement, and I am confidentially informed that
                            Government has received an order from Hankow regarding steps to be taken
                            to safeguard foreign lives with which this suggestion would accord.</p>
                        <p>It is respectfully suggested that, if the Embassy regards such action
                            desirable, and if there are no other objections to such a course, steps
                            be taken to communicate in the premises with the Japanese authorities,
                            and this Consulate be authorized to take appropriate action locally.</p>
                        <p>Maps of Nantai Island and Foochow City showing location of all American
                            property are being prepared and will be transmitted as soon as
                            possible.</p>

                        <p>658. The Japanese Minister, Mr. Tani, through the Japanese Consul General
                            at Shanghai has communicated to all diplomatic and consular officers at
                            Shanghai in writing a notice that with the development of military
                            operations in Kiangsu, Anhwei, and Honan south of the Yellow River and
                            especially along the Lunghai–Tsinpu and Peiping–Hankow Railways it is
                            the earnest wish of the Japanese military forces that all foreign
                            nationals in those areas immediately evacuate to safer places “in order
                            to avoid possible dangers to their lives and property from aerial
                            bombing and land fighting.” Mr. Tani’s letter states that in case
                            foreign nationals take refuge in areas under Japanese control the
                            contact will accord them as much protection as possible. It is essential
                            that the foregoing information be brought to the notice of American
                            citizens in the areas described.</p>

                        <p>295. 1. A reliable American who has just come from Paotingfu, Hopei,
                            states that this Japanese occupied city is virtually in a state of siege
                            from Chinese troops affiliated with the 18th Army Corps (formerly 8th
                            Route Army) some 20,000 with headquarters at Chichow (Anping) about 20
                            miles to the southeast having gathered in the vicinity since the
                            withdrawal in April of Japanese garrisons from small towns near
                            Paotingfu. He states that there are frequent skirmishes between Chinese
                            and Japanese soldiers in the outskirts of Paotingfu, that the Chinese
                            have torn up roads within 2 or 3 miles of the city, the railway is
                            constantly being damaged by Chinese soldiers and interrupted, the
                            Japanese withdraw at night to a barricaded section and Chinese troops
                            come nightly into the city.</p>
                        <p>2. Informant states that shells directed May 7 at Chinese soldiers in the
                            south suburb by a Japanese armored train endangered the American Board
                            Mission there, 2 falling in the mission compound, 2 near by and 1
                            further shell slightly damaging a mission building. The mission brought
                            this to the attention of the local Japanese garrison and was informed
                            that no guarantee against recurrence could be given <pb n="321"
                                xml:id="pg_321" facs="0325"/>since Chinese soldiers in the vicinity
                            must be attacked. The mission thinks however that more care will be
                            taken by the Japanese in the future but does not wish an official
                            protest to be made.</p>
                        <p>3. There are 10 Americans in Paotingfu, 2 men and 2 women in the
                            Presbyterian Mission. The Embassy suggested to the informant that their

                                repeating the Department’s telegram No. 106, April 14, 4 p.m., <ref
                                    target="#pg_309">p. 309</ref>.</note> Conditions along the
                            railway between Tsingtao and Tsinanfu have greatly improved since April
                            and trains are again running regularly. Japanese officials have promised
                            British-American Tobacco Company protection for its tobacco buyers.
                            Officials of the company who recently went into interior consider the
                            situation much better. Eleven American citizen tobacco buyers are among
                            those who intend to go to Ershihlipu on May 24, 25 and 26. No assistance
                            or advice has been requested from this Consulate and unless the
                            Department instructs otherwise no advice against taking risks will be
                            voluntarily given to individual buyers. An official of the company
                            states that the company would not let the men go if it were considered
                            unsafe and believes it would needlessly frighten them if the Consulate
                            should now advise them against taking risks.</p>

                        <p>For the further information of the Department there is transmitted a copy
                            of a letter dated May 11, 1938, together with the enclosure thereto,
                            received from the Mackay Radio and Telegraph Company. It will be noted
                            that the Japanese have created several transmitters for the purpose of
                            operating a direct service with the United States, that successful tests
                            have been conducted and that the Communications Attaché of the Japanese
                            Army has approached the Mackay Radio and Telegraph Company and requested
                            permission to use the company’s circuit for this service on the same
                            terms and conditions as formerly were in force with the Chinese Ministry
                            of Communications. It was subsequently learned that the Japanese had
                            addressed a similar request to R. C. A. Communications, Inc., and that
                            both companies had agreed to permit the Japanese to open a direct
                            service over their circuits on the same terms and conditions as
                            previously in force. The service was inaugurated on May 14, 1938, and is
                            reported to be functioning in a moderately successful manner.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Japanese plans, mentioned in my despatch no. 1384 of
                            April 26th, to establish a communications company to control all
                            Japanese radio, telegraph and cable activities in this area, it is
                            understood from R. C. A. Communications, Inc., that no company has yet
                            been formed. This appears to be due in large measure to the fact that
                            three different Japanese groups, namely, the Japanese military, Japanese
                            commercial radio and cable interests, and the Japanese Ministry of
                            Communications, are involved and thus far have not been able to compose
                            their differences and reach an agreement as to the composition of the
                            company, the exercise of control and other pertinent matters.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the final paragraph of the letter from the Mackay Radio
                            and Telegraph Company regarding a plan whereby it was proposed that the
                            British Radio Company of Shanghai should work with the Globe Wireless
                            Company, it has been learned from a representative of the Robert Dollar
                            Company, which owns and controls the Globe Wireless Company, that the
                            contemplated arrangement has in fact been abandoned. However, it was
                            stated that the Robert Dollar Company is still negotiating with the
                            Chinese Ministry of Communications for permission to operate a service
                            to the United States through the Globe Wireless Company, as mentioned in
                            this office’s despatch No. 1322 of April 4, 1938.<note n="19"

                        <p>1. I have today sent the following formal note to the Japanese Counselor:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I have the honor to refer to my letter of May 12 to Mr. Shimadzu
                                    of your Embassy who is in charge of Japanese consular police in
                                    which I stated, in my capacity as president of the
                                    Administrative Commission of the Legation quarter, that the
                                    Japanese authorities are without right to interfere with free
                                    passage through any street in the Legation quarter; to my oral
                                    representations on the morning of May 14 in regard to
                                    interference by Japanese consular police with free movement
                                    along Legation Street; to my several oral representations during
                                    the evening of May 14 in regard to interference with free
                                    movement in the Legation quarter by Japanese soldiers stationed
                                    with fixed bayonets on Legation Street, in the park along Canal
                                    Street, and at the entrance to premises of this Embassy occupied
                                    by Third Secretary Lyon and interference by Japanese consular
                                    police stationed in Legation Street; to my oral representations
                                    on the morning of May 16 in regard to interference with free
                                    movement along Legation Street by a Japanese consular police; to
                                    my oral representations on the morning of May 17 in regard to
                                    interference with free movement through the East Gate of
                                    Legation Street by Japanese consular policeman; and to my oral
                                    representations a few minutes later on the morning of July 17 in
                                    regard to the arrival at the foot of the ramp in Wall Street
                                    leading up to the American sector of the Tartar Wall of a truck
                                    crowded with Japanese soldiers and of several motocycles ridden
                                    by Japanese soldiers and to their stationing themselves there
                                    and stopping free omnibus travel along Wall Street between the
                                    American Embassy and the American sector of the Tartar Wall.</p>
                                <p>In regard to the last mentioned occurrence it is to be recalled
                                    that Mr. Horiuchi of your Embassy called on me at 10:45 on the
                                    morning of May 17 and said that a distinguished visitor
                                    accompanied by two or three Japanese consular police would like
                                    to take a walk at 11:15 a.m. that day along that part of the
                                    Tartar Wall which is under the control of the American Embassy
                                    guard. I then arranged with the American guard that the visitor
                                    accompanied by the consular police might be assured of an
                                    uninterrupted stroll along the American sector. Shortly
                                    thereafter in addition to the distinguished visitor and six
                                    consular police officers and men (instead of two) one military
                                    truck crowded with armed Japanese soldiers and several military
                                    motorcycles carrying armed Japanese soldiers arrived in Wall
                                    Street. The truck crowded with soldiers stationed itself for
                                    several minutes at <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0330"/>the
                                    foot of the ramp leading up to the American sector of the Tartar
                                    Wall. The soldiers on motorcycles dismounted, drove away the
                                    rickshaw pullers at the stand near the entrance of Sankuanmiao
                                    (American Embassy property) stationed themselves between the
                                    foot of the ramp Sankuanmiao and stopped all traffic along that
                                    part of Wall Street. A Japanese in civilian clothes proceeded
                                    several hundred feet west along Wall Street to the entrance of
                                    the American Marine Quartermasters compound and after driving
                                    away the rickshaw men waiting there for the convenience of
                                    American Marines on duty in that compound stopped movement along
                                    that part of Wall Street.</p>
                                <p>I desire to bring to your attention and to request you to bring
                                    to the attention of the responsible Japanese military
                                    authorities the serious impropriety of sending an armed force
                                    into such proximity to the American sector of the Tartar Wall
                                    without warning and in contradiction of the information
                                    previously supplied by your Embassy of stationing soldiers in
                                    Wall Street between American Embassy property (Sankuanmiao) and
                                    the ramp leading to the American sector of the Tartar Wall and
                                    of interfering with free passage through this street of the
                                    Legation quarter.</p>
                                <p>In view of the circumstances I can only anticipate that the
                                    Japanese military authorities responsible will see fit to
                                    express their regrets for these abuses of a courtesy which was
                                    gladly extended to your Embassy.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>2. The visitor referred to in this note is evidently not the visitor
                            mentioned in the telegram referred to above. It is understood that both
                            visitors are leaving Peiping today, not to return.</p>
                        <p>3. It is recommended that representations be made at Tokyo on the basis
                            of the above note in order that the Japanese military may show greater
                            regard for the established rights of the Legation quarters.</p>
                        <p>4. There have recently occurred a number of instances of derogation of
                            our rights by Japanese military. The Embassy therefore felt that a
                            formal note was advisable in this instance. In addition to the several
                            occasions of interference with free passage in the Legation quarter
                            mentioned in the note a number of difficulties have been experienced
                            recently with Japanese military at the railway station all of which have
                            now been settled. These instances were chiefly the impeding of the
                            movement of American marines in uniform performing official duties. On
                            one occasion five American marine officers were forced by armed Japanese
                            military into a line of Chinese passengers marshaled for searching.</p>

                            Roberts at Chefoo reported in a despatch dated May 2 that the local
                            Chinese authorities, at the instance of the Japanese naval authorities,
                            had stopped all shipments of kerosene and gasoline to the interior from
                            Chefoo. The Japanese Consul informed Roberts that one Japanese naval
                            landing party was having difficulties combating guerrilla forces in the
                            interior and had found it necessary to prevent the shipment to the
                            interior of munitions, foodstuffs and other articles suspected of being
                            used for military purposes by the guerrillas. Roberts obtained
                            permission for a small shipment of gasoline to an American missionary
                            station in the interior and believed that permission would be granted
                            for shipments of supplies to American mission stations. All other
                            shipments, however, are to be stopped, and the trade of the two American
                            oil companies out of Chefoo, amounting to about 5,000 cases weekly, had
                            completely ceased. Roberts had no hope that military restrictions could
                            be arranged. In a telegram of May 17, 3 p.m. he reports that
                            restrictions are still being imposed on commercial shipments to the
                            interior.</p>
                        <p>I believe that discussion of the matter with the Japanese Embassy here
                            will accomplish nothing and I therefore respectfully suggest that
                            representations be made to the Japanese Government at Tokyo.</p>

                            of the Legation quarter. We made today to the Foreign Office oral
                            representations on the basis of Peiping’s note to the Japanese Embassy,
                            urging that the Japanese military be directed to respect Legation
                            quarter rights. According to the Foreign Office, the visitors referred
                            to are Prince Kanin the younger and Prince Chichibu and they have
                            already left Peiping. The Foreign Office stated that it <pb n="328"

                        <p>719. 1. As an example of the length to which the Japanese are attempting
                            to drive American commercial enterprises from this area I quote the
                            experience of a large American firm whose up river organization
                            purchases raw materials in what is still Chinese controlled territory.
                            This territory has no road or railway connection with Shanghai, hence
                            the Yangtze River is its only artery of communication.</p>
                        <p>2. American, British and other foreign commercial craft except Japanese
                            are not permitted to pass through the boom at Kiangyin, situated less
                            than half way between Shanghai and Nanking, and below <pb n="330"
                                xml:id="pg_330" facs="0334"/>water point of firm’s cargo. Chinese
                            flag craft have already been stopped from bringing company’s materials
                            to Shanghai and the Nis-shin Kisen Kaisha now operating the steamers on
                            the Yangtze will only accept Japanese cargo with possible exception of
                            Chinese cargo having Japanese interests but never American or British
                            cargo.</p>
                        <p>3. Very reliable sources state that cargo policy of Japanese merchant
                            steamers on Yangtze is dictated by Japanese Army.</p>
                        <p>4. I believe the situation regarding wood oil of Werner G. Smith (see
                            Hankow Embassy’s 237, May 4, 2 p.m.<note n="24" xml:id="d434fn24">Not

                                Presbyterian Mission School deliver to them the mother, two sisters,
                                and a young brother of a Chinese suspected plain-clothes man. The
                                mission feared that these relatives might be tortured or maltreated
                                and requested the views of the Department of State. (393.1163P92/98,
                                99.)</note> As it appears that the Japanese now desire to question
                            several members of the family of the suspected plain-clothesman, it
                            would seem that that purpose could be effectually accomplished by an
                            examination of the persons concerned conducted by Chinese and Japanese
                            authorities on the Mission premises. The Department therefore considers
                            that the Mission authorities should offer to permit such examination on
                            the Mission premises in the presence of a representative of the
                            Consulate, but considers that they have no obligation to surrender to
                            the Japanese military the Chinese in question, who, it is understood,
                            are not accused of any crime.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that you approach your Japanese colleague in regard to
                            this matter and that you endeavor to impress upon him the unfortunate
                            reaction on public opinion in the United States if the Japanese military
                            authorities should insist upon the delivery of the Chinese in
                            question.</p>

                        <p>327. Following telegram has been sent by the Embassy here to the
                            Ambassador at Hankow: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“May 25, 5 p.m. Tsingtao reports in despatch No. 320 of May 17
                                    that according to the local vernacular press, the Tsingtao Peace
                                    Maintenance Commission has promulgated regulations requiring
                                    reregistration of land titles between May 16 and September 15.
                                    The regulations have not officially been brought to the
                                    attention of the Consulate but Gourley states that, unless
                                    otherwise instructed, he proposes to inform Americans who may
                                    inquire that, (1) the United States does not recognize the Peace
                                    Maintenance Commission and its regulations cannot be considered
                                    as applicable to Americans, (2) American authorities consider
                                    property titles previously issued by the Chinese Government as
                                    valid and sufficient, and (3) the Consulate will interpose no
                                    objection to voluntary compliance with the regulations by
                                    Americans, providing fees for registration are reasonable.</p>
                                <p>As you have recently instructed Tientsin on a somewhat similar
                                    matter, I feel that you may wish to instruct Tsingtao in the
                                    present case. I do not believe, however, that it would be
                                    necessary or advisable for Gourley to discuss with inquirers the
                                    first point mentioned above and I respectfully suggest that he
                                    be instructed to confine his advice to the last two points. I
                                    would suggest further that he be asked to ascertain and report
                                    by radio the views of his colleagues on this question.”</p>

                            <item>On the occasion of a call on the Japanese Consul General
                                yesterday, I again brought up these cases and was informed that an
                                investigation had been made and that the incidents grew out of the
                                refusal of the Texas Company and Dollar launches to stop on first
                                being hailed and because the Chinese crew were reluctant to give the
                                Japanese military patrol information as regards the destination of
                                the launches, whence they sailed and the reason for being on the
                                river at the time hailed. Consul General Hidaka stated that this
                                reluctance exasperated the Japanese patrol and that this led to
                                their assault upon the <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0342"
                                />crews of the two vessels. I asked Mr. Hidaka to put his statement
                                in writing in the form of a reply to my two letters on the subject
                                and he agreed to do so. He stated that the military were not
                                warranted in boarding the vessels, I stated that this was certainly
                                correct and that the military patrol by exercising more patience
                                could have obtained all the information it desired by remaining
                                alongside the launches. A mail report will be sent to the
                                Department.</item>

                        <p>2. My British colleague has stated the British Ambassador is disposed to
                            protest the imposition of the regulations and has inquired of me as to
                            whether I would be prepared also to lodge a protest. Inasmuch as efforts
                            are being made by the health authorities of the International Settlement
                            and the French Concession to encourage cholera inoculations I believe
                            that it would be inadvisable to lodge a formal protest, but a strict
                            enforcement of the regulations against foreigners may lead to
                            unpleasant, and perhaps serious, incidents. While not disposed to inform
                            the Japanese Consul General that the regulations cannot be enforced
                            against Americans, I believe it would <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339"
                                facs="0343"/>be well to remind him that a strict application of the
                            regulations will most likely lead to unpleasant occurrences and that it
                            would be advisable to apply the regulations with the least possible
                            friction and annoyance to American nationals. There is a possibility
                            that the regulations have been issued largely to prevent the passage
                            into the areas mentioned of Chinese who have not received cholera
                            inoculation. The Department’s instructions are respectfully
                            requested.</p>

                                        investigation. Both incidents had occurred shortly after

                                        stop by the picket boats, both launches attempted to escape,
                                        they were overtaken and boarded. The Japanese patrols were
                                        wrought up over the failure of the launches to stop and the
                                        resulting chase and consequently took their spite out of the

                                    should have been presented to the Ambassador ere this. He would
                                    request the Foreign Office to expedite the transmission of the

                                General’s letters of May 30 and June 2 is pointing out that in a
                                letter dated August 26, 1937, addressed to the Japanese Consulate
                                General, a list was enclosed of all American property in this
                                consular district and that on May 28 information concerning the
                                property of the American Church Mission at Anking, Anhwei, was again
                                furnished to the Japanese authorities at the request of the mission.
                                However, in replying to these letters I am again stressing the fact
                                that regardless of whether the location of American property has or
                                has not been notified to the Japanese authorities full
                                responsibility rests upon them for the protection and safeguarding

                        <p>According to a report from Yenchowfu, Dr. Frederick G. Scovel, an
                            American Presbyterian missionary, was shot through the side at Tsining
                            on June 2nd or 3rd by a drunken Japanese soldier. Dr. Scovel was said to
                            be trying to protect Chinese nurses in the mission hospital against
                            Japanese soldiers who were looking for women. Although the wound is
                            serious he is expected to recover.</p>
                        <p>Matter has been taken up with Japanese Consul General.</p>
                        <p>Sent to Hankow, Peiping.</p>

                                printed.</note> and previous in regard to alleged transfer to Hunt
                            and Company of title to properties of China Merchants Steam Navigation
                            Company Limited.</p>
                        <p>The Department has examined record of case submitted for its
                            consideration and is in general accord with the views expressed in your
                            201, April 12, 3 p.m.,<note n="41" xml:id="d452fn1">Not printed.</note>
                            to the effect that the agreements purporting to convey absolute
                            indefeasible title to the properties under reference to Hunt and Company
                            cannot be regarded as legally effective to accomplish that purpose and
                            that the records strongly suggest that the principal if not the sole
                            purpose of the purported transfer of title was to afford a basis for
                            claiming American protection for properties owned by the Government of
                            China. The Department therefore does not recognize the claim of American
                            ownership of the properties and no protection will be extended to those
                            properties by American representatives. Hunt may be advised
                            accordingly.</p>

                        <p>It would appear that responsible officers of the Chinese Government must
                            have been aware of the effort to use the agreements under reference as a
                            basis for claiming American protection for the properties and it is not
                            perceived, therefore, that any useful purpose would be served in making
                            any official communication in regard to the matter to the Chinese
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Whether Hunt and Company has any valid claim against the Chinese
                            Government, and if so, whether the company is entitled to any assistance
                            from this Government in connection with such claim, are questions which
                            can be considered if and when they arise.</p>
                        <p>Department suggests that American diplomatic and consular officers in
                            China be informed of the substance of the foregoing and of Department’s
                            general attitude as explained in its 334, May 21, 4 p.m., to

                            May 30, 1938, noon, regarding the Japanese request to Third Powers to
                            mark their properties with national flags and also to submit maps
                            showing the exact location thereof, I have the honor to state that from
                            the information on file at this office it would appear that American
                            missions would scarcely be justified in believing that compliance with
                            the Japanese request would cause their property to be unmolested.</p>
                        <p>This office has on record several letters from American mission stations
                            in the interior which have been bombed by the Japanese and which were
                            flying American flags at the time of the bombing. A list of these cases
                            is given below: <list>

                                    February 3, states that the American flag was painted on the

                                    displayed.”</item>

                                    21, 1938 Japanese planes bombed and machine gunned the premises,
                                    totally destroying thirteen rooms and partially destroying six

                                <item>Kweiteh (Shang Kiu), Honan (see No. 4 above). Maps of the
                                    premises of the Southern Presbyterian Mission at this place were
                                    forwarded to the Embassy at Peiping on February 28 and April 12.
                                    On May 20, 21, 22 and 23 Japanese planes bombed in the immediate
                                    vicinity of this property, the bombs falling very close to
                                    American flags. The actual damage to this property was reported
                                    to be negligible, but this lack of damage may be safely regarded
                                    as fortuitous.</item>

                        <p>Within the last three weeks Japanese aviation forces have extensively
                            bombed wide areas in China both within and without the zones of
                            hostilities. Bombings by Japanese airplanes have been reported in Honan,
                            Hupeh, Kiangsu, Chekiang, Kiangsi and Kwangtung provinces, and among
                            other cities, those of Canton, Chuki, Chumatien, Kanhsien, Kiehnow (five
                            raids on May 30), Kwangchang, Nancheng, Nanhsiang, Ningpo, Pucheng,
                            Siangyang, Haichow, Hwaian and Sutsien. With the exception of the last
                            three mentioned places, these cities have not been in the zones of
                            hostilities. It is impossible to estimate the number of individual raids
                            in the period under reference. However, according to reports received by
                            the Department, there have been no less than thirteen bombing raids on
                            the city of Canton within the past thirteen days (three raids on May
                            28). Likewise, complete information is lacking as to the number of
                            casualties among the civilian populations and as to the extent of
                            damages.</p>
                        <p>In so far as American-owned properties are concerned, there have been
                            reported six bombings of American missions within the period under
                            reference. On May 19, the Free Methodist Mission at Cheng-chow was
                            severely damaged by Japanese bombing. The Lutheran United Mission at
                            Chumatien was bombed on May 21 resulting in extensive damages. The
                            Southern Presbyterian Missions were bombed and severely damaged on May
                            24 and 28 at Haichow and on May 26 at Hwaian and Sutsien.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the bombings at Canton, which, with the exception of
                            June 1 and 2, have taken place daily since May 27, thousands of
                            non-combatants have been killed and wounded and much property destroyed
                            and burned. It has been reported that during the raids on May 28 and 29
                            and June 4, over three thousand were killed and wounded.<note n="*"
                                xml:id="d455fn1">British estimates for the casualties resulting from
                                the raids on May 28 and 29 and June 3 and 4 place the number of
                                killed and wounded at twenty-one hundred. [Footnote in the
                                original.]</note> According to British reports, during the raids on
                            May 28, 29 and 30 less than one-third of the bombs were directed at
                            airdromes and industrial plants and of the sixty or more sites bombed
                            less than ten were of military importance. The attacks would appear to
                            have been and to be directed chiefly against residential areas. In
                            addition, the Lingnan University, which lies some distance out of the
                            city and which is partly American owned and supported, has been bombed
                            by Japanese air forces.</p>

                        <p>3. While Lingnan University has been since 1927 a Chinese administered
                            institution a substantial part of the lands and buildings remain vested
                            in an American board of trustees in New York and part of the support of
                            the institution continues to come from American sources. Thirty-seven
                            American citizens are now residing at the University. The University and
                            campus are clearly removed from the city of Canton and urban areas. The
                            Department can perceive no warrant whatever for the attack under
                            reference. The Department therefore desires that unless you perceive
                            objection the Embassy make appropriate representations to the Foreign
                            Office setting forth the above-mentioned facts and requesting that
                            urgent measures be taken to prevent any future attack upon the property

                        <p>800. Rear Admiral Nomura, Chief of the Japanese Naval Special Service
                            Section at Shanghai, issued a formal statement to the press yesterday in
                            which it is stated that “Such cities as Canton, and Hankow” are
                            “defended cities” protected by large numbers of recently installed
                            anti-aircraft artillery “set up in all parts of these cities
                            indiscriminately” and, in many cases, “in the immediate vicinity of
                            property belonging to nationals of third powers” and that “under such
                            circumstances, our air units have had no choice but to carry out their
                            recent raids at higher altitudes than before, with the inevitable result
                            that some civilian casualties and damage to dwellings and other
                            structures located in close proximity to military objects have
                            occurred”. The statement continues “while great care will continue to be
                            exercised to secure the maximum degree of accuracy in the marksmanship
                            of our air forces, it is, at the same time, our intention to carry out
                            air raids with even greater vigor so as to bring the Chinese authorities
                            to realize the futility of their present attitude and in order that the
                            hostilities, of which these air bombardments are a concomitant part, may
                            be brought to a termination as speedily as possible. It is, therefore,
                            the desire of the Japanese Naval authorities that the citizens of third
                            powers resident in those cities will not only themselves avoid the areas
                            in which China’s anti-air defenses are located, but also advise the
                            ignorant Chinese to seek shelter away from such zones.”</p>

                        <p>113. Shanghai’s number 754, June 1, 11 p.m., and press reports that Japan
                            was sending an Interdepartmental Committee to investigate means of
                            restoring American property in Central China under the occupancy of
                            Japanese forces.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Consul General gave a dinner last night in honor of Bos,
                            visiting Netherlands Secretary, at which were present a Mr. Ishii of the
                            American Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Office and a Lieutenant Colonel
                            Nishi of the American Section of the Japanese Ministry <pb n="347"
                                xml:id="pg_347" facs="0351"/>of War, who had just arrived from
                            Shanghai. It developed that these two, together with a naval officer who
                            was not present, compose the Interdepartmental Committee referred to
                            above. They arrived in Nanking by airplane at noon yesterday and left by
                            train early this morning and their investigations here consisted of
                            talks with high military and naval officials and a conversation lasting
                            about 20 minutes with me after dinner in a crowded room where we were
                            subject to interruption. It is perhaps significant that no attempt was
                            made by either Mr. Ishii or Colonel Nishi to talk with the British
                            Consul, who was present, concerning the return to Nanking of his
                            nationals, or the protection of British property.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ishii began by making the familiar excuse that it was not yet safe
                            for foreigners to return to Nanking in large numbers, but upon being
                            pressed and particularly upon being asked why it was apparently safe for
                            missionaries to return and not for business men he made the statement
                            that with regard to the missionaries only Americans were concerned but
                            if business men were permitted to return it would be necessary to permit
                            the return of persons of all nationalities and the authorities do not
                            wish to do that at present. It was obvious that the return of British
                            business men was what was most feared by the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that the Japanese authorities simply do not want foreign
                            business men to return to Nanking and that excuses will continue to be
                            made unless some stronger action is taken by the interested governments.
                            I therefore recommend that both Tokyo and Shanghai be instructed to
                            continue to press for the return of business men to Nanking but that if
                            no success is achieved by July 1st, that the Japanese authorities be
                            notified that representatives of the Standard Vacuum Oil Company and the
                            Texas Company, the two American organizations most concerned, are being
                            brought to Nanking on the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic">Oahu</hi> on her
                            next trip (on or about July 11th according to present plans) and that
                            the American Government trusts that no obstacles will be placed in the
                            way of these men landing in Nanking. If we continue to request
                            permission it will be refused on one ground or another but if we notify
                            the Japanese that the men are coming, as was done in the case of the
                            naval radio operator coming ashore, I believe they will cause no
                            trouble. My British colleague has informed me that he is prepared to
                            make similar recommendations to his Government with regard to obtaining
                            the return of British business men to Nanking.</p>

                            the desirability of authorizing American naval vessels to escort junks
                            and barges loaded with cargo which is the property of Americans to
                            Shanghai. I would particularly recommend such action in regard to wood
                            oil cargo which was at Nanking, delivery of which to Americans has not

                        <p>811. Department’s 364, June 8, 6 p.m., wood oil belonging to Werner G.
                            Smith Company. I took up personally with Hidaka on June 1 the release of
                            the wood oil and left with him a memorandum on the subject. Further
                            representations have been made since and 2 days ago the Japanese naval
                            authorities seemed inclined to release the wood oil immediately but the
                            orders were not forthcoming. Yesterday the matter was discussed by Vice
                            Consul Espy with a member of the staff of the Japanese Consulate
                            General. The latter spoke with the Japanese naval authorities. They
                            stated that they will have an answer as to the release of the wood oil
                            and the arrangements for its delivery after they have consulted with
                            their officials in Nanking. This answer is promised within 1 or 2 days,
                            and if unsatisfactory I will then ask Tokyo in its discretion to make
                            further representations.</p>

                            similar notices this afternoon from the Japanese Consul General who
                            explained that the suggestion for distinguishing marks was not “rigid”;
                            that foreign naval vessels would be expected to use their own methods of
                            employing distinguishing markings; that all the Japanese naval and
                            military authorities are concerned about is that vessels navigating the
                            stretch of the Yangtze described be so clearly identified by markings
                            that there would be no possibility of a mistake being made by aviators;
                            that flags flying or painted on awnings had by experience been proven
                            not altogether reliable as a means of protection.</p>
                        <p>I told my Japanese colleague of the action taken on Mr. Tani’s<note
                                n="55" xml:id="d465fn55">Japanese Minister at Large in China.</note>
                            notices and informed him that the communication of the notices in no way
                            relieved the Japanese authorities of their responsibility. I [asked?]
                            him to communicate this observation to Mr. Tani.</p>
                        <p>Hidaka stated that the Japanese intended to move on Hankow and expected
                            to occupy it in due course. Admiral Yarnell has been informed of the

                        <p>Shanghai’s May 30, noon, to the Embassy [at] Hankow repeated to
                            Department regarding request of Japanese Consul General, Shanghai, for
                            maps showing localities of properties of third powers in certain
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>American property holders in areas named within this consular district
                            have been informed of this further request. I desire however <pb n="351"
                                xml:id="pg_351" facs="0355"/>to invite the Department’s attention to
                            the fact that the areas named by the Japanese Consul General at Shanghai
                            are in large measure the same as the areas set forth in the Japanese
                            Embassy note January 31 last to Peiping (see Peiping’s telegram No. 81
                            February 2, 7 p.m.<note n="56" xml:id="d466fn56"><ref
                                    target="frus1931-41v01#pg_576"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                        Relations</hi>, Japan, 1931–1941, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                        >i</hi>, p. 576</ref>.</note>). In this note Japanese
                            Embassy requested that one map be forwarded to Peiping and this has been
                            done in one instance. The request contained in Shanghai’s May 30, noon,
                            is for four copies of maps to be forwarded to Shanghai. This has
                            resulted in considerable extra labor, confusion and misunderstanding and
                            it is not unlikely that still further requests for maps may emanate from
                            other Japanese sources. The practical value of supplying these maps is
                            questionable as set forth in my despatch to the Embassy No. 547 of June
                            7. Furthermore the wisdom of complying with the Japanese request is
                            questioned by property holders as witness a letter just received from
                            the Methodist Mission at Nanchang, Kiangsi, one of the points especially
                            mentioned in Japanese letter of May 30th. The missionary in charge
                            writes that the mission has properties spread over the city, that the
                            houses are marked with American flag and that if he were to furnish maps
                            of the city showing the location of mission properties he would be in
                            effect furnishing information to the Japanese which would give them
                            bearings by which to locate any point desired. This he states would be
                            betraying information to China’s enemies.</p>
                        <p>I have endeavored to make clear to Americans concerned that the supplying
                            of maps is purely voluntary on their part and that this office is merely
                            suggesting that those who may wish to do so comply with the
                            procedure.</p>

                            erected gates, barbed wire entanglements around boundaries and have now
                            stationed 250 soldiers within Concession. They have one small sloop and

                            fighting extends into this area.</p>
                        <p>It is locally expected that Americans and others whose property is not
                            located in French Concession, or who are not resident in French
                            Concession can remain in their places of residence, but if an emergency
                            arises and it should appear necessary for protection of life to evacuate
                            foreigners from Hankow onto ships in the river, present plan is to
                            concentrate in French Concession for purposes of evacuation of
                            foreigners. This is a change from previous plan which had been devised
                            in 1932. This plan does not, however, nullify advisability of again
                            reminding the Japanese of the presence of foreigners, their property and
                            their shipping in the area generally described in my 33, December 13, 4
                            p.m. I have furnished colleagues with a copy of my 278, June 8, 3 p.m.
                            and understand that they also are recommending similar action in Tokyo.
                            I repeat this plan has nothing to do with emergency evacuation scheme
                            apparently referred to by Hankow office of National City Bank. Every
                            effort will be made to afford naval protection to all American property
                            in this area provided it does not interfere with the primary mission of
                            protecting lives.</p>

                        <p>175. Your 283, June 10, 3 p.m. With reference to the recommendation
                            contained in Nanking’s 113, June 9, 2 p.m., in regard to the return of
                            American businessmen to Nanking and the Embassy’s recommendation in
                            regard to the question of authorizing American naval vessels to escort
                            junks and barges carrying American cargoes, the Department is of the
                            opinion that it would not be advisable to give consideration to these
                            recommendations pending the receipt of the Japanese Government’s reply,
                            if not unreasonably delayed, to our recent representations in regard to
                            the reoccupation of American property, as it is probable that such
                            reply, which we understand will be made after the completion of the
                            investigation of the Japanese inter-departmental committee, will have a
                            bearing on the matter under reference.</p>
                        <p>We of course concur in the view that Shanghai and Tokyo should in their
                            discretion continue to press matters relating to restrictions upon the
                            freedom of American trade.</p>
                        <p>Please repeat to Shanghai with instructions to repeat to Tokyo.</p>

                        <p>1. Newspapers carry today United Press story dated Shanghai, June 12,
                            with sensational headlines such as “Yarnell defies Japan”, “Won’t bar
                            U.S. ships in war zone”, “Says Navy will go where it is needed”, “Sharp
                            reply to Nippon insists upon right to guard Americans”, etc.</p>
                        <p>In text this story contains statements such as: “In a sharply worded
                            message, Yarnell set forth three principles of American naval operation
                            in Asiatic waters”; “Yarnell reinforced his refusal to accept the
                            Japanese request by planning an inspection of American fighting ships
                            stationed up the Yangtze. He made his attitude even more specific by
                            ‘informing’ the Japanese of his intention of making the trip”, etc.</p>
                        <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0358"/>
                        <p>The American Government deprecates and deplores such publicity. It adds
                            greatly to the difficulty of our endeavors to have our own press and
                            public envisage in proper perspective the situation in China and our
                            policy and procedure in general in reference thereto.</p>
                        <p>There is a strong element of public opinion in this country which is
                            opposed to the running of any risks of American embroilment abroad and
                            which advocates complete withdrawal from any and all points of danger in
                            the Far East, with insistence especially upon removal of all our armed
                            forces. Any publicity suggestive of a bellicose attitude on the part of
                            our people, whether official or unofficial, in China, simply plays into
                            the hands of such elements.</p>
                        <p>This Government desires that all action, including giving of publicity,
                            by American official representatives in the Far East be in conformity
                            with the concepts of policy and execution outlined in previous
                            instructions and public utterances repeatedly made by the Secretary of
                            State on the subject of affording protection under rules of reason.</p>
                        <p>2. In the light of the above, the Department questions the advisability
                            of Admiral Yarnell making a visit to Nanking and Wuhu at a time when
                            active hostilities are imminent or in process immediately above Wuhu.
                            Navy Department has no indication what would motivate such visit. Please
                            telegraph Department your view as to advisability of such visit at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>3. This telegram is being repeated to Shanghai and will be shown to
                            Admiral Yarnell.</p>

                            repeated Yarnell’s comments to me. On June 12, 1 p.m., I instructed
                            Consul General at Shanghai to make reply to Mr. Tani’s letter quoting
                            Admiral Yarnell’s comment to me. Please note that all of unimportant
                            messages were in plain and that Admiral Yarnell’s telegram was addressed
                            to me and carried no indication whatever that he had made any
                            communication to Japanese authorities or to press. <pb n="355"
                                xml:id="pg_355" facs="0359"/>The local English language paper <hi
                                rend="italic">Central China Post</hi> dated June 13 carried a
                            Central United Press item dated Shanghai June 12, stating that Admiral
                            Yarnell had rejected Japanese request “in his reply to the Japanese
                            today through the American Consulate General”. There followed a
                            summarization of Admiral Yarnell’s comments addressed to me phrased in
                            such a way as to indicate that Admiral Yarnell had communicated this to
                            the Japanese. I had a call on June 13 from the local Associated Press
                            correspondent who had received an inquiry in regard to this matter from
                            his New York office and had [been] instructed to obtain my comments. I
                            refused to make any comments stating that I knew of no reply which
                            Admiral Yarnell had made to Japanese authorities. On June 14 Associated
                            Press correspondent again called, stated he had received a request from
                            his New York office instructing him to obtain text of Admiral Yarnell’s
                            statement. I telegraphed Admiral Yarnell and, informing him of
                            appearance of item in local paper, stated that I had refused to make any
                            comment and that I had referred Associated Press to Shanghai. Admiral
                            Yarnell informed me on June 14 that he had given no information to the
                            press in Shanghai and that he had been unable to trace the source of the
                            United Press report.</p>
                        <p>Department will therefore see that neither Admiral Yarnell nor I have had
                            anything whatever to do with publicity which United Press based upon
                            this story. I suspect that United Press was able to intercept the
                            message which Yarnell sent to me through naval wireless circuit and used
                            it in its story. Story is misleading and incomplete and evidently—from
                            excerpts quoted by the Department—was intended to mislead press at home
                            as to actual attitude of the Navy here. We here are anxious to run no
                            risks in these present times, and every reasonable precaution has been
                            exercised by the Navy and by the Embassy and the Consulates. Warnings
                            have been issued from time to time to Americans to evacuate places of
                            danger, and Consulates and Embassy have done everything in their power
                            with the cooperation of the Navy to facilitate such evacuation when
                            possible. The Embassy is not aware of any act on the part of the Navy or
                            on the part of the Consulates or itself which has not been in conformity
                            with concepts of policy and its execution outlined in the Department’s
                            instructions. Obviously we here cannot foresee or prevent speculative
                            comments by the press intended apparently to be tendencious and to cause
                            embarrassment.</p>
                        <p>Your paragraph 2. Department has requested me to comment as to
                            advisability of visit which Admiral Yarnell has planned to make to me
                            and to Wuhu. This plan has been in mind for some time, and I personally
                            see no reason why the Admiral should not make the visit contemplated.
                            Visit is not in area of immediate hostilities and is in <pb n="356"
                                xml:id="pg_356" facs="0360"/>the ordinary course of naval inspection
                            and will I believe be productive of good rather than harm. Certainly it
                            should not be accompanied by any more danger or embarrassment than
                            visits to Tsingtao, Chefoo or Chinwangtao.</p>

                        <p>Department’s telegram of June 13, 7 p.m. I have since last September
                            continued to urge evacuation of Americans who had no urgent occupation
                            in China. These representations have been made more urgent recently and
                            practically the only Americans in this district at present are those
                            actively engaged as doctors, nurses, teachers, missionaries (many of
                            whom assist in medical work), newspaper representatives and
                            representatives of American companies.</p>
                        <p>The school year at Lingnan has ended and it is hoped that most of the
                            American teachers as well as the American exchange students will leave
                            in the near future. I am urging them to do so.</p>
                        <p>The American hospitals are doing a great humanitarian work and it is
                            thought this should continue unless the danger becomes greater.</p>
                        <p>If invasion by land forces should eventuate, I believe a general <pb
                                n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0361"/>evacuation should be urged;
                            otherwise Americans in this district are believed to be at present in
                            comparatively safe places.</p>
                        <p>In Canton there are now the following white Americans: 31 male
                            missionaries, 17 teachers, 14 representatives [of] American companies, 5
                            doctors, 2 trained nurses, 4 exchange students, the house [<hi

                            wives and children. There are also a number of American men who come and
                            go.</p>

                        <p>117. While riding in a rickshaw through a public street in Nanking just
                            before noon today, Dr. J. C. Thomson, an American citizen, and member of
                            the faculty of the University of Nanking, was stopped by a Japanese
                            sentry, questioned, searched and slapped across the face, though he had
                            made no attempt to resist the sentry in any way. Dr. Thomson immediately
                            reported the matter to the American Embassy after which I accompanied
                            him to the Japanese Consulate General where I lodged a strong protest.
                            In company with Vice Consul Kasuya and a consular policeman we then
                            returned to the spot where the incident had occurred but the offending
                            sentry had been relieved by another soldier. However, the Japanese
                            officials made notes of the location and promised to make an immediate
                            investigation. I informed Mr. Kasuya that I would expect a report of the
                            results of the investigation this afternoon and that I would hold up my
                            report of the matter until this evening so that the Japanese report
                            might be incorporated therein.</p>
                        <p>Kasuya reported this afternoon that Japanese gendarmes had questioned the
                            sentry, who admitted having searched Dr. Thomson, but denied
                            categorically that he had slapped him. I informed Mr. Kasuya that this
                            explanation was entirely unsatisfactory as when Dr. Thomson had come to
                            the Embassy this morning he was still in a nervous condition as a result
                            of his experience and his face bore a faint flush where he had been
                            slapped. A further investigation was requested.</p>
                        <p>I have made the following requests of the Japanese Consul General: (1) An
                            apology should be made to Dr. Thomson by a military representative, (2)
                            the guilty soldier should be punished and the American Embassy informed
                            of the punishment, and (3) assurances should be <pb n="358"
                                xml:id="pg_358" facs="0362"/>given that the military authorities
                            have taken adequate steps to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.
                            The Japanese Consul General has been informed that if the above requests
                            are promptly and satisfactorily carried out I shall recommend that the
                            incident be considered closed and that no publicity be given to it, but
                            I have made it clear that the final decision in this regard rests with
                            the Department of State. It is therefore requested that information
                            concerning this incident not be made public until tomorrow night at
                            least when it is hoped to have a more favorable report from the Japanese
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>Sent to the Ambassador. Repeated to the Department, Peiping and Shanghai.
                            Shanghai please mail to Tokyo.</p>

                            missionaries to their stations and occupation of American property. As
                            the result of repeated discussions with the Japanese authorities here
                            concerning the above questions and in particular regarding the return of
                            American missionaries to Soochow and the vacating of American properties
                            in that city occupied by Japanese troops, arrangements were made for two
                            American mission representatives to proceed to Soochow and discuss these
                            questions with the military authorities there. These representatives
                            returned to Shanghai yesterday and reported that they were cordially
                            received by the Japanese garrison commander and were informed by him
                            that he had no objection to the return of American missionaries but that
                            passes would have to be obtained in Shanghai. While in Soochow these
                            representatives were also conducted on a tour of inspection of American
                            property and found that approximately 50% of the occupied property had
                            been vacated recently and that Japanese troops were preparing to vacate
                            several additional buildings. In this connection the Japanese
                            authorities have informed me orally that instructions were issued
                            recently by military headquarters here to the military at Soochow to

                                certain points have still to be decided, the Japanese reply will be
                                forthcoming shortly. He then spoke off the record at considerable
                                length on conditions at Nanking. It is our opinion that his
                                observations, which are summarized hereunder, indicate the nature of
                                the reply which is to be made by the Foreign Office: <list>

                                    <item>It is a fact that there are now in Nanking approximately
                                        1,000 Japanese nationals. But those nationals are required
                                        to live within a specified area, where they can be
                                        conveniently protected, and are amenable to strict control
                                        and supervision by the Japanese authorities. As all
                                        available troops have been mobilized for the attack on
                                        Hankow, the garrison at Nanking is being depleted to the
                                        prejudice of the police <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360"

                                        population. As foreigners would not tolerate the
                                        restrictions being imposed upon Japanese nationals, the
                                        presence in Nanking of a large number of foreigners would
                                        inevitably result in incidents arising from inadequate
                                        policing of the city. The possibility is being considered of
                                        withdrawing opposition to the return of foreigners on
                                        condition that each individual give a written undertaking to
                                        relieve the Japanese Government of all responsibility for
                                        incidents occurring through inadequate police protection.
                                        The question of course arises whether the governments of
                                        nationals involved in such incidents would not hold the
                                        Japanese Government responsible, notwithstanding such

                                        representations made by me on May 31. Nevertheless the fact
                                        is that the military authorities as well as the Foreign
                                        Office had been working on these cases for some time and the
                                        action taken happened to coincide with the representations
                                        made by me on May 31. In continuation of efforts along these
                                        lines the military authorities had already approved along

                        <p>300. Supplementing my 292, June 15, 10 [<hi rend="italic">11</hi>] a.m.,
                            I submit following as evidence of efforts on the part of Consulate
                            General here to comply with the Department’s instructions regarding
                            evacuation of American citizens.</p>
                        <p>In late summer of 1937 there were present in Hankow Consular District
                            approximately 1,200 American residents, and in addition several hundred
                            American summer visitors at the 2 summer resorts. Circulars were sent
                            out during the period from August to December advising evacuation. By
                            the end of 1937,430 Americans had left this area by train for Hong Kong.
                            Others left by air or by other routes overland.</p>
                        <p>During this same period, orientals, [<hi rend="italic">some?</hi>] others
                            came into this area as refugees from north of the Yellow River or from
                            Shanghai, and some are still here hoping that conditions will permit
                            them to return to their work.</p>
                        <p>When hostilities started along the Lunghai the Consulate General at
                            Hankow in January and February repeated advice previously given to
                            Americans in Honan, Hupeh, Anhui and Shansi. On June 7th the Consul
                            General called a meeting of the heads of American business and
                            missionary organizations in Hankow and strongly urged that women and
                            children and men who could be spared should evacuate while
                            transportation was available. This advice was supplemented by a circular
                            instruction addressed to Americans in Hankow, Wuchang and Hanyang on
                            June 9. Upon the receipt of instructions to the Embassy No. 176, June
                            13, 7 p.m., the Consulate General, on the advice of the Embassy, issued
                            a telegraphic warning on June 13 through the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Monocacy</hi> at Kiukiang to Americans at Kiukiang and Killing.
                            This was supplemented by a circular instruction.</p>
                        <p>Since January 1, 1938 an additional 490 Americans have left this area by
                            train for Hong Kong, making total recorded evacuation of 920. Some have
                            returned for various reasons, and at present there are about 825 in the
                            Hankow Consular District. The American community—both business and
                            missionary, has sent away by far the greater part of its nonessential
                            members, and those who remain believe that it is vitally necessary that
                            they stay in order to preserve their interests. These are Americans who
                            are not transients, but permanent residents engaged in business,
                            missionary or medical work. There are a few in Kuling who have retired
                            to that hill resort for age or physical reasons and who cannot or do not
                            intend to leave. <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0366"/>American
                            doctors, nurses and missionaries at Kiukiang and Wuhu and other places
                            will remain at their [posts], not only to preserve their interests, but
                            also to carry on, at a time when their services are most needed, the
                            work for which they have come to China. It has been amply demonstrated
                            in other areas in China that the only means by which Americans may hope
                            to retain their property and other interests is by being present during
                            the period of turnover. They realize risks involved. Consulate General
                            and naval vessels at Hankow must of course remain here, for it is
                            believed that they will be safer here than at some place up river
                            completely out of touch.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Suma took occasion in connection with his call on another matter to
                            bring up the subject of the return of American businessmen to Nanking.
                            He said that the Embassy had been making earnest efforts in connection
                            with our request for the removal of restrictions by the Japanese
                            authorities upon the return to Nanking and other places in the lower
                            Yangtze Valley of American businessmen. He said that the action of the
                            Japanese authorities in granting passes to some missionaries to return
                            was not a consequence of the note we had presented to the Japanese
                            Government but was the result of a decision reached before the receipt
                            of our note, which decision was in response to the representations made
                            by the Japanese Embassy here to the Foreign Office in Tokyo. Mr. Suma
                            observed that it was a coincidence that action in the matter had closely
                            followed upon the receipt of the note. Mr. Suma said further that the
                            Japanese Foreign Office was making earnest efforts to overcome the
                            difficulties surrounding the return of American businessmen and hoped
                            that favorable action would soon be taken, but expressed the hope that
                            we would not press the matter, as he felt that Japanese psychology was
                            such that the sending of further formal communications would tend to
                            hamper the efforts of the Foreign Office in this direction.</p>
                        <p>I said that I appreciated the interest and efforts of the Japanese
                            Embassy in this matter, but I expressed the hope that Mr. Suma would
                            understand the very great importance of the matter to American business
                            interests and the desirability of expediting favorable action.</p>

                            report in Japanese of the findings of the Japanese military authorities
                            regarding the Thomson incident. The Consul General’s note reads in part

                                <p>“The Japanese military authorities, with deep concern about the
                                    matter, have made thorough investigations about the soldiers
                                    concerned. The result of the investigations, however, has
                                    revealed definite information as the attached report clearly
                                    shows, that the sentry never slapped Dr. Thomson across his
                                    face. The military authorities even have an eye witness who
                                    testified that the sentry never made such an attack upon Dr.
                                    Thomson and they are prepared to confront him with Dr. Thomson
                                    at any time.</p>
                                <p>This being the case, there is not only no opportunities of
                                    considering the three points raised in your note, but it must be
                                    requested that you will give deep considerations to insults
                                    given to the Japanese sentry, discharging his solemn duties, by
                                    an exaggerated and groundless report. In this connection, I
                                    expect that you will admonish Dr. Thomson adequately.</p>

                                <p>I wish to inform you lastly that the Japanese military
                                    authorities reserve their liberty of taking adequate measures in
                                    the event of such cases as this, which subjects Japanese
                                    soldiers to insults, continuing to happen in future.”</p>

                        <p>The report of the military authorities enclosed with the note from the
                            Japanese Consul General attributes the searching of Dr. Thomson to the
                            sentry’s having mistaken him for a Chinese. It categorically denies any
                            act of violence to Dr. Thomson’s person.</p>
                        <p>I have orally informed a representative of the Japanese Consulate General
                            that the matter will be referred to the Ambassador and the Department
                            and that I do not feel inclined to take any further action until
                            instructions are received. Dr. Thomson has expressed a willingness to
                            make a sworn statement regarding the incident and I request authority to
                            accept his affidavit under item 44 of the tariff of fees.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that the final paragraph of the Japanese Consul General’s
                            note almost constitutes a threat against any American who reports
                            misconduct on the part of Japanese soldiers. In my opinion there is not
                            the slightest doubt of the veracity of Dr. Thomson’s statement but I
                            should appreciate any suggestions the Ambassador or the Department may
                            wish to make as to all further action.</p>

                        <p>380. 1. A secretary of the Japanese Embassy called this morning and read
                            from a document received by that Embassy from its military authorities
                            an expression of regret on the part of the Japanese military authorities
                            for the wounding of Dr. Scovel. The incident is outlined in the
                            document, all blame being placed on the “drunken” and “undesirable”
                            Japanese soldier. It reports that regret was expressed to Scovel and his
                            family by the Japanese authorities at Tsining and states that the
                            soldier will be punished severely in accordance with the <pb n="366"
                                xml:id="pg_366" facs="0370"/>army’s laws and regulations. (The
                            Secretary stated that we shall be orally informed later as to the
                            punishment.)</p>
                        <p>2. A major of General Terauchi’s staff called this afternoon, with an
                            Embassy Secretary, and expressed the regret of the Japanese military
                            authorities for the wounding of Scovel. He offered a solatium of $400,
                            to defray Scovel’s medical expenses. I thanked him for the expression of
                            regret and for the offer of the solatium but requested him to withhold
                            the solatium until it was learned whether Scovel wished to accept it. He
                            finally consented to do so.</p>

                        <p>872. On June 11, 1938, the Carolina Leaf Tobacco Company, an American
                            firm, informed me that 558 hogsheads of tobacco belonging to it and
                            stored in the godowns of the Joint Savings Society north of Soochow
                            Creek were found to have disappeared. The company stated further that on
                            November 1, 1937, the day following the occupation by units of the
                            Japanese naval landing party of these godowns, the company applied to
                            the Japanese Consulate General through this office for permission to
                            remove this cargo. The company made repeated requests but was not
                            granted permission to visit the godowns until May 1, 1938, when the
                            manager, together with representatives of the Japanese naval landing
                            party and a Swiss subject inspected the godowns and found all tobacco
                            had been removed; inasmuch as traces of tobacco, which was still dry,
                            were found in the godown, the manager is of the opinion that the tobacco
                            had been removed shortly before the date of inspection.</p>
                        <p>On May 12 I informed the Japanese Consul General of the above facts and
                            requested that this American-owned cargo be located and returned without
                            delay, reserving the right to claim compensation for any losses suffered
                            by the company. In a reply dated June 14, the Japanese Consul General
                            stated in part as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The godown of the Joint Savings Society had been occupied by
                                    Chinese troops since August 1937 and consistently fierce
                                    fighting was carried on in and around the godown between the
                                    landing forces of the Japanese Navy and the Chinese troops.</p>
                                <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0371"/>
                                <p>It was proved later that all hogsheads of tobacco stored there
                                    were used by the Chinese in place of sandbags to cover
                                    themselves from attack. The Japanese landing forces therefore
                                    seized all hogsheads of tobacco that remained there as booty
                                    after their occupation. In view of the foregoing I beg to inform
                                    you that to my regret neither the return of hogsheads of tobacco
                                    to the former owner nor any claims for damages in tnis
                                    connection can be taken into consideration.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In the meantime the manager of the company has been approached on several
                            occasions by Chinese and Japanese “go-betweens” offering to sell this
                            tobacco back to him which he has reason to believe has been sold by the
                            Japanese naval landing party to tobacco merchants.</p>
                        <p>I am making further representations to the Japanese authorities here
                            protesting against such arbitrary treatment of American property
                            particularly when the original request to remove this cargo was made to
                            the Japanese general by this office on November 1, 1937, and pointing
                            out that the refusal of the Japanese authorities to return this cargo or
                            to compensate for same is a very serious matter and has been referred to
                            the Department.</p>

                        <p>122. Tokyo’s 385, June 16, 6 p.m.—return of Americans to Nanking. The
                            following comments with regard to the observations of the Foreign Office
                            official, quoted in the above mentioned telegram, may be of
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the Japanese contention that incidents affecting
                            Americans might arise in Nanking through inadequate police protection is
                            not entirely valid. It is probably true that some Japanese nationals
                            have suffered at the hands of unruly Chinese but since the return to
                            Nanking of the Embassy staff not a single report has come to our
                            attention of Chinese harming foreigners (other than Japanese) in any
                            way. The foreign population has amounted to approximately 35 persons
                            placed in various parts of the city. Even granting the troop withdrawals
                            mentioned, the Nanking garrison must still contain at least 5,000 men,
                            from which it is believed adequate police protection could be
                            provided.</p>
                        <p>The fact that Nanking is one of the principal bases for the attack upon
                            Hankow and that there is considerable military activity here cannot be
                            denied, but the possibility of foreigners conveying military information
                            to the Chinese is certainly no [<hi rend="italic">not?</hi>] great. They
                            would, <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0373"/>of necessity, live
                            inside the city walls, whereas most of the military activity takes place
                            along the waterfront, the entrance of foreigners to which is restricted
                            to officials and others holding special passes.</p>
                        <p>Stanley Bishop Rick, the American mentioned in Tokyo’s telegram, has been
                            to Nanking more than once, but he is the representative of a British
                            lumber company and was brought here at the specific request of the
                            Japanese military who wished to purchase lumber from his company.
                            Pickering and Shields have however expressed a desire to make a
                            temporary visit to Nanking to investigate the condition of their
                            companies’ property and to assess possibilities of resuming
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the Japanese request that the American Government not
                            press for the return of an unlimited number of businessmen at this time,
                            it should be pointed out that, as far as is known, there are not more
                            than six American businessmen desirous of returning to Nanking at
                            present.</p>
                        <p>Sent to Embassy, Hankow. Repeated to Shanghai. Shanghai please mail to
                            Tokyo.</p>

                        <p>888. 1. I have received a petition addressed to the Secretary of State
                            and signed by 45 American doctors and nurses. The petition points out,
                            firstly, that the medical profession is international and nonpolitical;
                            secondly, that for decades mission hospitals have been centers for
                            medical relief throughout the Yangtze Valley; thirdly, that for the past
                            5 months many American doctors and nurses have been refused permission
                            to return to and carry on medical work in the area mentioned; fourthly,
                            that because of this prohibition this area has been deprived not only of
                            the services of medical missionaries but also of such relief as has been
                            offered by other American agencies. The petition, therefore, requests
                            that the Department of State “take up with the Japanese Government the
                            question of the immediate return of these American doctors and nurses to
                            the American owned institutions of the Yangtze Valley, in order that
                            their work may be carried on without hindrance in these days of great
                            medical need”. I informed the petitioners that the substance of their
                            petition has been telegraphed to the Department.</p>
                        <p>2. I explained to the committee who presented the petition the efforts
                            which this Consulate General and the Embassy at Tokyo have exerted in
                            the demurs set forth in the petition and assured them that these efforts
                            would be continued.</p>
                        <p>3. In general the Japanese have shown more consideration to doctors and
                            nurses than to any group of Americans desiring to return to the
                            interior, the first group of Americans returning to Nanking being
                            doctors and nurses and since June 1 other doctors and nurses have
                            returned to that city. In every particular the return of missionaries
                            including doctors and nurses to such large mission centers as Soochow,
                            Wusih and Chinkiang has not yet been effected although the indications
                            are favorable. Therefore, further representations made at this time
                            would be most helpful.</p>

                                Office on June 20 (our 392, June 20, 5 p.m.), the Thomson case was
                                again taken up today with the Foreign Office. We stated that
                                questions were asked about this case yesterday at the Secretary’s
                                press conference, that the American Government is not disposed to
                                give the matter publicity, but that if the case is not speedily
                                solved in a way satisfactory to us, full publicity to the facts
                                would have to be given. As the first step toward such solution, the
                                Consul General at Nanking should be directed to withdraw his letter
                                to Allison. The Foreign Office replied that, according to a report
                                received from the Japanese Consul General, the evidence available to
                                the Japanese is that Thomson was not believed slapped as charged.
                                The Foreign Office added that the single allegation by Dr. Thomson
                                would not be considered sufficient to overcome such evidence, but
                                that if the American authorities at Nanking could present evidence
                                corroborating that of Dr. Thomson the Japanese authorities would be
                                prepared to give the matter further consideration. We stated that if
                                there were any doubt whatever as to the facts of the case as stated
                                by Dr. Thomson, the occurrence of the Massie case would tend to
                                remove such doubt.</item>

                                        in Nanking as of June 10 setting forth the applications of
                                        American citizens desiring to return to places under
                                        Japanese occupation along the Yangtze. There are included in
                                        the list the names of 26 American missionaries whose
                                        applications have been approved, and of these, 2 are
                                        connected with mission hospitals. In addition the
                                        application of Dr. G. S. Trew to return to Nanking has been
                                        approved. The Foreign Office states that all applications of

                                        June 10 have been approved, and that it believes that

                                        similar favorable consideration.</item>

                            <item>The member of my staff informed Okazaki that we had been trying
                                for a long time unsuccessfully to get Japanese passes for American
                                businessmen who wished to return to Nanking and that the American
                                Ambassador and the State Department were becoming increasingly
                                concerned over the failure of the Japanese to permit them to return;
                                [and that?] the Standard Vacuum Oil Company was understood to have
                                made arrangements for its Nanking district manager to proceed on the
                                U. S. S. <hi rend="italic">Isabel</hi> on June 23 and Okazaki was
                                urged to expedite the issuance of the necessary pass for him and the
                                other American businessmen desiring to go to Nanking. Okazaki stated
                                that he hoped no American would go to Nanking without a pass as some
                                British subjects had done, as the Japanese would then have to refuse
                                the issuance of all passes for Americans desiring to proceed to the
                                interior. He said that the Japanese had planted sentries around the
                                International Export Company premises in Nanking, thus confining the
                                British subjects to the premises, and that the Japanese intended to
                                require them to return to Shanghai and obtain passes before they
                                would be given access to Nanking, or any other British subjects
                                would be given passes for Nanking. He said that if we refrained from
                                sending Americans to Nanking without passes he could assure this
                                office that passes for American businessmen would be issued in “a
                                week or 2 weeks”. He requested that this be brought to my attention.
                                Later Okazaki telephoned the Consulate General and was informed that
                                in view of his assurances that passes would be granted for American
                                businessmen to return to Nanking within a week or 2 weeks, the
                                Standard Vacuum Oil Company was not sending its representative to

                        <p>Tsingtao Peace Maintenance Committee has issued new private radio
                            receiving set regulations requiring owner of receiving sets to register
                            and obtain permits from police. The only sets now permitted are long
                            wave sets within the bands from 550 kilocycles or 545 meters to 1500
                            kilocycles or 200 meters. American owners of combined long and short
                            wave sets object to registering under new regulations for fear they will
                            no longer be allowed to use sets now in their possession and that such
                            sets will become valueless even if no attempt is made to confiscate
                            them. The regulations do not name clearly any penalty for noncompliance.

                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Some third party nationals now residing in Japanese occupied
                                    territory in China appear to labor under the misconception that
                                    they are above Japanese law because they enjoy extraterritorial
                                    status insofar as China is concerned. That is wrong. In the same
                                    way that aliens do not enjoy special privileges in Japan, they
                                    are not entitled to special treatment in Japanese occupied
                                    territory in China. It may be possible that they seem to think
                                    differently because of their long residence in China, where they
                                    enjoy extra[territoria]lity.”</p>

                                situated is located within the area where, from the necessity of
                                military operations, neither nationals of the third powers nor the
                                Chinese are allowed to enter or reside.” It is stated in the letter
                                that the Japanese military and naval authorities are prepared to
                                give favorable consideration to the matter of placing watchmen on
                                the premises of the university and making necessary repairs to the
                                property when they are informed of the details of the plan, provided
                                that such plan “is not incompatible with the necessity of military
                                operations”. The letter further states that the matter of paying
                                compensation for losses sustained by the university as a result of
                                its use by the Japanese military forces will be considered later in
                                connection with similar cases.</item>

                            <item>I made no commitment to the Japanese Consul General but observed
                                that the conditions laid down by the Japanese military and naval
                                authorities in connection with the return of the property would
                                necessarily have to be brought to the attention of the mission
                                authorities concerned and that this would be done today. I told Mr.
                                Hidaka <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0383"/>that the
                                restrictions thrown around the use of the property would probably
                                not be well received by the missionary authorities because they had
                                previously informed the Consulate that the use of the property by
                                the Baptist Mission would require free communication between the
                                campus and the mission headquarters in the International Settlement;
                                that it would require freedom to employ Chinese workers and servants
                                and to transport materials and supplies and to do all that is
                                normally done in connection with the residence of the members of the
                                mission on the campus. I told Mr. Hidaka that the members of the
                                mission felt very strongly on this point.</item>

                            <item>Mr. L. C. Hylbert, chairman of the Administrative Commission of
                                the university, and Dr. M. T. Rankin, of the Mission Board, came to
                                see me this morning at my request and stated that they did not see
                                how they could consistently accept the return of the university on
                                July 5 under the conditions and restrictions imposed by the
                                Japanese. They hold that as stated above unless they have free
                                access to and control of the property its return would be
                                meaningless and that they could not conscientiously report to their
                                home boards that the property had been returned to their control.
                                These representatives believe and I share their belief that
                                complications will arise with reference to visits, repair work and
                                watchmen, especially in view of the fact that the grounds are
                                located in an area which it seems now evident the Japanese intend
                                ultimately to turn into a fortified military zone. The
                                representatives are also apparently influenced by the unfavorable
                                reaction which they feel would be loathsome amongst their large
                                Chinese constituency if they should compromise the issue with the
                                Japanese.</item>

                            <item>In view, firstly, of the important principle involved and,
                                secondly, of the large sum of money at stake, namely, well over
                                $1,000,000 United States currency, the members of the board, at my
                                suggestion, decided to refer the question to their head office.
                                Unless on further consideration they should change their position,
                                which I do not believe will be the case, they will recommend against
                                accepting the return of the university on the conditions named. I
                                personally believe that the offer which the Japanese have made to
                                return the university is merely the preliminary step in an effort to
                                purchase the property, inasmuch as it is in the immediate zone of an
                                area which I believe it is intended to convert into a military zone.
                                The area includes transient airfield and Point Island on which
                                latter area there are American properties. I believe that the
                                position of the board’s representatives in recommending rejection of
                                the offer has merit but I should greatly appreciate the views of the
                                Department on this point for my guidance in further discussions with
                                the board’s representatives here.</item>

                            Japanese Embassy spokesman described as “incorrect” statement previously

                        <p>918. 1. The substance of Hankow’s 316, June 25, 3 p.m. to the Department
                            was communicated orally to Hunt and he has also been informed of the
                            hoisting of the American flag on the China Merchants properties
                            described in Hankow’s 318, June 27, 11 a.m. to the Department.</p>
                        <p>2. In a conversation with Hunt today he stated that William Hunt and
                            Company have instructed their representative that under no conditions
                            are the movements of the China Merchants vessels to obstruct or
                            interfere with the free movement of the United States ship <hi
                                rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> in proceeding up or down river. Hunt
                            stated that McDonnell<note n="91" xml:id="d507fn91">R. T. McDonnell,
                                general manager of William Hunt and Company, Shanghai.</note> has
                            returned from Hong Kong where a conference was held in which William
                            Hunt and Company insisted upon the full delivery of the China Merchants
                            property to William Hunt and Company and [China] Merchants, with the
                            approval of the Chinese Government, have agreed to the delivery of same
                            without further obstruction commencing with the delivery of the property
                            at Kiukiang, Hankow and other river ports. Hunt also states that at
                            other ports delivery has been completed. William Hunt and Company
                            respectfully request that their taking over of the properties will not
                            be interfered with or impaired by United States Government agencies and
                            that the question of implementing the Department’s decision will remain
                            in abeyance pending the outcome of McDonnell’s conference with
                            Department officials (see my telegram No. 874, June 20, 8 p.m. and 894,
                            June 24, 11 a.m.<note n="92" xml:id="d507fn92">Neither printed.</note>).
                            William Hunt and Company feel that the divulgence of the Department’s
                            decision officially or privately will severely damage them and most
                            probably result in the Chinese when retreating destroying wharf
                            property. They insist that they have been strictly ethical in this
                            matter and they wish emphatically to assure the Department that the
                            documents were not negotiated to give American protection to Chinese
                            Government property. Hunt has repeatedly assured me that he was
                            attempting to divest Hunt and Company of the vessels and lighters at
                            Hankow and Kiukiang as distinguished from the wharves, godowns and
                            equipment thereof and now confirms that he does not intend to take the

                            interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs including an itemized
                            list of well over 100 specific cases of injury to American property in
                            China by bombing, looting and other causes, of damage at the hands of
                            Japanese troops. I propose to hand this list to the Minister at the
                            beginning of our interview and then to take up seriatim the various
                            points and principles set forth by the Department. Unless the Department
                            sees some reason for delay I shall seek the interview with the Minister
                            towards the end of this week, probably Friday.</p>

                            received from Amoy, Chefoo, Nanking, Shanghai, Tientsin and

                        <p>Japanese interference with American trade at the above named ports is
                            great and in the interior is complete. It includes denial of free
                            movement of Americans; refusal to permit them to return to their
                            properties and businesses, particularly in the Shanghai and Nanking
                            areas; restrictions on the movement of cargoes; seizures of American
                            goods; restrictions on shipping and other means of transportation;
                            occupation of American properties; interference with Chinese employees
                            of American firms; manipulation of currency; prohibition of shipments to
                            the interior; new Japanese inspired customs tariff which <pb n="383"

                            interference. Financial losses incurred by American business as a result
                            of this interference cannot be estimated without obtaining reports from

                                    decreased to less than 5 percent of that amount due to Japanese
                                    occupation and virtual blockade of Chinese transportation along
                                    Fukien coast; Texas Company has suffered similar percentage
                                    decrease and its representatives have not been permitted to

                                    local currency and deposit, to one tenth that amount, confined
                                    to sales in Chefoo. New currency regulations hamper importers of
                                    American goods and exporters of [lace] and embroidery to the

                                    officials are interfering to an extraordinary extent in the
                                    insurance business of Tientsin; that Japanese insurance agents
                                    are not only forcing Chinese firms under threats of physical
                                    violence to the firms’ officers to take out Japanese insurance
                                    but compelling them to pay much higher rates than those offered
                                    by other firms; the informant states that recently he made a bid
                                    for the usual insurance business of the Peiping-Mukden Railway
                                    at the rate of 75 cents per thousand dollars but a Japanese firm

                        <p>323. Shanghai’s 918, June 28, 3 p.m. The only comment that I have to make
                            upon statements made to Consulate by Hunt concerning delivery to William
                            Hunt and Company of property of China Merchants at Kiukiang, Hankow and
                            other river ports is that it is significant that this process is taking
                            place only at a time when it is becoming obvious that active hostilities
                            are approaching the ports concerned. Furthermore, I know of no personnel
                            of William Hunt who are American and sufficient in number and present at
                            ports in question who can or will take charge of such property. Process
                            of delivery apparently consists merely in putting up new signboards and
                            painting or hoisting American flags. If this is permitted to continue,
                            the presence of flag upon bona fide American interests cannot but be
                            brought under suspicion. We should not permit Chinese Government to
                            continue in the dark as to our attitude.</p>

                            Smith Company. I have received a letter today from the Japanese Consul
                            General stating that although the information supplied by this Consulate
                            General “was not completely satisfactory to the Japanese naval
                            authorities in proving the ownership of the oil it was decided to give a
                            special consideration for this case and release the oil on the
                            understanding that it will be kept on board of the junks at Nanking
                            until such time as its removal down to Shanghai becomes feasible without
                            causing friction. It is understood that this does not constitute a
                            precedent in the settlement of similar cases in the future”. A member of
                            my staff this afternoon discussed the case with the Japanese consular
                            officer handling the matter. The latter stated that the Japanese naval
                            authorities at Nanking would release the oil to the authorized American
                            representative of the Werner G. Smith Company there, but only on the
                            condition that the oil be kept in the junks, that the junks be brought
                            down to Nanking and turned over to the U.S.S. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Oahu</hi> to be placed in the concentration of American vessels now
                            at Nanking. He added that due to the pressure of Japanese military and
                            naval traffic on the Yangtze River the Japanese naval authorities would
                            definitely not permit the shipment to be transported to Shanghai, nor
                            could they give any assurances as to when such transportation might be
                            effected. In response to an inquiry as to whether, after the release was
                            made, the authorized representative of the Werner G. Smith Company would
                            be permitted to remove the oil from the junks and store it in the
                            Jardine Matheson hulk at the Hogee<note n="98" xml:id="d512fn98"
                                >International Export Company.</note> installation pending its
                            ultimate shipment to Shanghai, he replied that such a disposition of the
                            oil would require a further consideration by the Japanese naval
                            authorities.</p>

                        <p>If the release, as proposed by the Japanese naval authorities, is
                            accepted, it is true that the cargo would be placed in a location where
                            it might be more easily safeguarded from possible theft or ignition, but
                            the terms of the release are such as would result merely in removing the
                            oil from the immediate control of the Japanese naval authorities and yet
                            leave it at the same time subject to the restrictions placed by the
                            Japanese upon its transportation to Shanghai.</p>

                        <p>Embassy’s telegram June 1, 4 p.m. Following is monthly telegraphic
                            summary for June.</p>
                        <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0392"/>
                        <p>City of Tsingtao was quiet throughout June. Japanese continued to keep
                            garrisons along railway but traffic on railway was stopped from June 23
                            to June 26 during which time track was damaged in at least 3 places
                            beyond Chengyang a station about 20 miles from Tsingtao and 1 freight
                            train was reported to have been derailed and looted by guerrillas. It is
                            generally predicted that guerrilla activities near railway are on
                            increase with growth of Kaoliang. American citizen tobacco buyers
                            fearing isolation at Ershihlipu returned to Tsingtao believing that
                            situation will not improve for at least 6 weeks.</p>
                        <p>Away from the railway the Japanese are far from in control of the
                            situation. Pingtu and Chucheng have been evacuated. Tsimo, 30 miles from
                            Tsingtao, is one of the few towns off the railway in Japanese hands but
                            Japanese are not in possession of surrounding area and main road is
                            damaged frequently. Ichowfu or Lini is reported more or less stirred by
                            Chinese guerrillas but Japanese garrison there has sufficient supplies
                            to hold out for some time. Guerrillas are active very close to Tsingtao
                            in mountainous regions to northeast. By damaging roads and bridges
                            guerrillas make it difficult or impossible for Japanese to keep
                            garrisons in interior towns.</p>
                        <p>Unsuccessful in meeting guerrilla tactics Japanese are following policy
                            of dropping bombs from airplanes on numerous villages in almost all
                            parts of this general area. According to missionary reports bombs are
                            often dropped on village market days killing many innocent civilians.
                            Foreign missions are endangered by this bombing policy. American
                            Southern Baptist Mission School compound at Pingtu were bombed on June
                            15th with much damage to buildings. American Lutheran Mission girl
                            school compound at Tsimo was bombed on June 25 with great harm to
                            buildings. Fortunately Americans escaped injury but at Tsimo 1 American
                            was in great danger. Motives for these bombings are unknown. Swedish
                            Baptist [Mission] at Chungcheng also threatened, requested protection.
                            On June 16 a Japanese sentry slapped Chinese steward, regularly enlisted
                            member of U. S. S. <hi rend="italic">Trunnsmell.</hi></p>
                        <p>On June 17 Japanese civilian member [of] Japanese military special
                            mission arbitrarily seized keys of 126 bathing boxes belonging to
                            foreign Consuls and other foreigners, in some cases throwing away
                            contents. One week later keys were returned with explanation that
                            seizure was a mistake. On the 25th of June Japanese naval gendarmes
                            seized keys, smashed notices and removed some furniture from the
                            International Recreation Club in which Americans invested. Naval
                            authorities later admitted [announced] seizure was however mistake but
                            still wish to use club premises. New regulations prevent importation and
                            use of short wave radio.</p>

                                    lighters. It was understood that the Chinese Government owned
                                    property had been taken over by William Hunt and Company, an
                                    American company, with offices in Shanghai. The commanding

                                    properties, it seems wise that I communicate the above facts to
                                    you in order that you may take such steps as may be necessary to
                                    have orders to hoist the American flag over these properties of
                                    the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company canceled. I am sure
                                    that you will agree with me that only in this way will much
                                    embarrassment and misunderstanding be prevented.”</p>

                            Japanese Consul General and the Japanese naval authorities in Amoy,
                            foreigners and certain employees of foreign firms were permitted to
                            return to Amoy. American industries with stocks stored in Amoy generally
                            found their property intact. Chinese refugees were permitted to return
                            to Amoy from June 27th after procuring certificates of inoculation and
                            vaccination from Japanese physicians and payment of $1 registration. A
                            Peace Maintenance Society was set up in Amoy on or before June 21st by
                            the Japanese in lieu of a municipal government. This body is generally
                            composed of discredited Chinese petty politicians who have been out of
                            office or jobs for years. Amoy quiet during June with small Japanese

                                <p>I have further been informed by the Japanese naval authorities
                                    that in view of the fact that the case in question originated
                                    solely in the misunderstanding caused by the ignorance of the
                                    languages of the people involved and cases of this kind could
                                    have been avoided should both parties have been more
                                    considerate, the Japanese naval authorities already issued
                                    instructions to all of the naval units stationed here to be more
                                    thoughtful in dealing with foreign nationals. I trust that you
                                    will no doubt share our feeling of depreciation [<hi
                                        rend="italic">deprecation</hi>] and will take necessary
                                    steps to advise your nationals resident in Tsingtao to take full
                                    cognizance of the abnormal situation prevailing here and act
                                    with discretion whenever they come into contact with Japanese

                                the Foreign Office, which stresses that the chief difficulty in the
                                way of settlement lies in the insistence of the Japanese naval
                                authorities that their rule must be kept intact, that the Yangtze is
                                not yet open to commercial traffic. We pointed out that it is a poor
                                rule that can not be broken. However, it is our belief that the real
                                difficulty is Japanese suspicion that there is substantial Chinese
                                proprietor]y interest in the wood oil shipment. We suggest that the
                                Department may wish, in the light of such recommendation as you may
                                wish to make, to authorize you to give the Japanese Consul General
                                at Shanghai a simple and clear undertaking that the shipment is

                        <p>341. Department’s 196, July 5, 6 p.m. There are at the present time some
                            10 American citizens in the city of Kiukiang and some 50 American
                            citizens at Kuling. These Americans have been warned to evacuate but
                            will remain there, some to perform duties connected with their work as
                            missionaries or owners of property, others for reasons of health or
                            because they have no other place to which they may go. In any case
                            evacuation now would be impossible except into the interior as
                            transportation by river is now cut off because of mine field between
                            here and Kiukiang now being laid. It has been and is the intention of
                            the commander of the Yangtze Patrol to leave <hi rend="italic"
                                >Monocacy</hi> at Kiukiang with orders to move away from areas of

                            3 miles above Kiukiang. Chinese and Japanese authorities will be
                            constantly informed of whereabouts of <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi>. I
                            feel that <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> can and will perform needed

                            sent after consultation with commander of Yangtze Patrol. May I add that
                            Americans involved are not casuals but persons with interests and
                            property. The danger to them will or should be no greater than that
                            which has threatened Americans at other places during these
                            hostilities.</p>

                                substantially as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>We are gratified to note the statement that the Japanese
                                        authorities are all zealously working for local settlements
                                        of incidents affecting American nationals and property; we
                                        have also noted the Foreign Minister’s view that publication
                                        in the American press by the American Government of
                                        incidents which are progressing towards local settlements
                                        tends to delay such settlements.</p>
                                    <p>We have noted with appreciation the Foreign Minister’s views
                                        but regret that we find unconvincing the reasons adduced for
                                        delays in making settlement of cases. In cases affecting
                                        American interests, the American Government has consistently
                                        endeavored to follow a procedure calculated to meet the
                                        situation most effectively without arousing public feeling.
                                        For this reason in regard to matters pending with the
                                        Japanese authorities it has been our practice to refrain
                                        from giving publicity to the facts and to our
                                        representations except in cases where the matters have
                                        already been given publicity elsewhere—which occurs in most
                                        instances—or in cases such as that of the University of
                                        Shanghai where the American interests concerned, because of
                                        apparent lack of progress toward a local settlement, become
                                        growingly insistent upon formal action and upon public
                                        knowledge of what is being done.</p>

                                press correspondents make it their practice to write, as soon as
                                they learn that an incident has occurred and without having any
                                information from the Department, stories to the effect that the

                                will venture, when opportunity occurs, to suggest to persons who may
                                mention and appear to rely on such reports that the reports may be
                                inaccurate.</item>

                                    exactly accurate to say that understanding has been reached
                                    between the American and Japanese naval authorities with regard
                                    to the final settlement of the case. However, the Japanese Chief
                                    of Staff has expressed regrets, instructed that the Japanese
                                    naval authorities will cooperate to prevent similar incidents in
                                    the future and has stated that Japanese naval sentries have been
                                    given strictest instructions in regard to United States naval
                                    personnel and dependents. I am, therefore, of the opinion that
                                    nothing is to be gained by continuing the controversy and that
                                    the incident should be considered closed. The Japanese naval
                                    authorities have shown a conciliatory attitude in this matter,
                                    and I believe really desire to prevent incidents of this

                        <p>Department realizes that it is impossible for us here to judge the
                            details and have the “feel” of the situation with the degree of
                            qualification for deciding what steps should be taken from moment to
                            moment that are possible to officers on the spot. However, we feel that
                            Commander-in-Chief’s 0012–1335 constitutes a very sound guide to
                            procedure which should be followed. All officers who have to make
                            decisions should understand clearly that this Government earnestly
                            desires that unnecessary risks be not taken and chance of there
                            occurring another Panay incident be avoided just as far as possible. In
                            the light of telegrams from Hankow, Department assumes that few if any
                            of the American nationals now at Kiukiang and/or Kuling will be willing
                            to board the <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi>. It cannot be expected that
                                <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> will send out landing parties. Would
                            not giving by the <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> of notice of intended
                            departure, with offer of transportation, lead to embarkation by such
                            American nationals as are willing to leave? Would any further standing
                            by of the <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> serve any useful purpose in
                            regard to those not willing to leave? Would not the situation locally
                            and the national interests of the United States and the policy which
                            this Government is following be best served by the procedure indicated
                            in Department’s telegram to Shanghai of July 7 quoted above?</p>
                        <p>Department offers no opinion as to substance of reply that diplomatic
                            representatives of the powers should make to the new Japanese warning,
                            if given as stated in the Associated Press story mentioned <pb n="399"
                                xml:id="pg_399" facs="0403"/>above. However, Department hopes that
                            all American authorities concerned will in conferring with the
                            authorities of other powers, and in making reply, have constantly in
                            mind that this Government is endeavoring to pursue a course which takes
                            full cognizance of the fact that hostilities are in progress and that
                            where such is the case absolute immunity from danger or harm cannot be
                            guaranteed to and is likely not to be afforded to other persons and
                            property either by the combatants or by their own Governments. On this
                            basis, while we assent to no impairment of our rights, we feel that all
                            efforts made in defense of these rights should be in accordance with
                            principles of reason and of proportion as outlined in various public
                            statements of the Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>Please bring the whole of the above immediately and informally to the
                            attention of the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

                                        proprietary interest other than American in the wood oil
                                        shipment under reference; that when this shipment left
                                        Hankow in October last it consisted of 280 tons; that this
                                        amount has now apparently dwindled to some 123 tons (as

                                        and, that, while no publicity in America in connection with
                                        this case has thus far come to the attention of the

                                        to which the Department would be compelled to admit that

                                <p>On June 20 the Imperial Japanese Government having in view the

                                    powers nationals made a certain communication to the third

                                <p>As various information points to the conclusion that the Chinese
                                    Army intent upon the defense of Hankow is at present
                                    concentrating great numbers of troops and piling up large
                                    quantities of munitions in certain strategic areas, the Japanese
                                    military forces will be compelled if strategically required to
                                    carry out most intensive bombing upon Chinese troops and their
                                    military establishments in these areas especially in the
                                    following places: Sinyang and its vicinity; Hankow and its

                        <p>347. Reuter reports today from Shanghai a statement by Japanese spokesman
                            that Japanese consular authorities have addressed note to Consuls of
                            third powers requesting evacuation of nationals from Hankow, Kiukiang,
                            Kuling, Nanchang, Changsha and Yochow. Japanese military authorities
                            have from time to time been informed of presence of American citizens at
                            Kiukiang, Hankow, Kuling and other places. It is at present time
                            physically impossible for removal of American citizens from Kuling even
                            if they wished to leave and Japanese must know this. There are no
                            Chinese military concentrations at Kuling. Foreign population at Hankow
                            could not be evacuated entirely. Japanese must know this. Japanese
                            military have been informed of presence here of Americans, of the places
                            where they will be and it is not necessary that their lives be
                            endangered as they threaten. I hope that such reply may be made as will
                            definitely inform Japanese military that such American nationals as now
                            remain in these places cannot leave and that we expect the Japanese to
                            do everything possible for their safety.</p>

                            <item>Yoshizawa’s extempore comment was that, notwithstanding reference
                                by the Japanese Consul General in his note to Lockhart to the
                                question of the ownership (see Shanghai’s 926, June 29, 4 p.m.), it
                                seemed to him that the offer of the Japanese naval authorities to
                                transfer the oil to the custody of the American authorities at
                                Nanking makes that question no longer a live issue.</item>

                            <item>With reference to the statement that Japanese vessels pass freely
                                between Shanghai and Nanking and have accepted freight, his comment
                                was that such freight was probably sutlery and other goods for sale
                                to Japanese troops and to Japanese residents and not ordinary
                                commercial cargo. We feel that it would be wise tactically to drive
                                home, before the Foreign Office replies, the fact that Japanese
                                vessels are carrying commercial freight on the Yangtze, and we hope
                                that Shanghai and Nanking will send us precise data. We would, of
                                course, be careful in using this material not to prejudice the basic

                        <p>980. Department’s 236, July 9, 5 p.m. to Tokyo. In a conversation
                            Saturday with Morishima, Counselor of Japanese Embassy, I pointed out to
                            him the urgent necessity of the Japanese naval authorities releasing the
                            wood oil, with permission for its shipment to Shanghai. It was suggested
                            that facilities for shipment be accorded on one of the Japanese freight
                            vessels now plying the Yangtze. Morishima was reminded of the fact that
                            this Consulate some weeks ago, as well as the Embassy at Nanking, had
                            assured the naval authorities that the wood oil was American owned. I
                            said that it seemed to me that an assurance of this kind from the
                            Consulate General and from the Embassy should be sufficient to identify
                            the American ownership of <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0407"/>the
                            property. Morishima has just been informed that the sole purpose of
                            seeking the release of the wood oil is to enable the company to put it
                            on the market; that the oil is used only for the making of paints and
                            varnishes; that it is deteriorating in quality and value and that its
                            release without some facilities for its movement to the Shanghai market
                            is of no material value to the owners of the property.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On June 25 the Foreign Office spokesman
                            issued an “informal statement for the information of newspaper
                            correspondents” to the effect that nationals of Third Powers residing in
                            either one of two countries which are in conflict have in principal a
                            status, as stipulated by the international rules and regulations
                            governing belligerency, like that of any other private individuals of
                            the country in which they reside. To uphold his contention the Foreign
                            Office spokesman cited two precedents in international law, the first
                            being the refusal of the United States Government to accede to the
                            demand of the French Government that compensation be paid for losses
                            sustained by French nationals as a result of the bombardment by the
                            American Navy on July 13, 1854, of Greytown (now San Juan del Norte) in
                                Nicaragua.<note n="18" xml:id="d539fn18">See John Bassett Moore, <hi

                            of war, by the British Fleet in 1807. As will be noted from the enclosed

                            the <hi rend="italic">Japan Advertiser</hi> of June 25, 1938, which
                            gives Domei’s version of the statement, the spokesman remarked that the
                            American note refusing the demand of the French Government after the
                            bombardment of Grey-town, had cited the case of the British attack on
                            Copenhagen, when no claim was made by any third Powers to the British
                            Government for compensation for losses sustained by their nationals who
                            were residing in Copenhagen at the time.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, it would appear by inference that the Foreign Office spokesman
                            holds the view that nationals of third Powers who have owned property in
                            China during the present hostilities are not entitled to claim
                            compensation from Japan for losses resulting from these hostilities. The
                            Foreign Office spokesman would appear to base his <pb n="404"
                                xml:id="pg_404" facs="0408"/>argument on the American Government’s
                            contention of 1854 that nationals of third Powers residing in a country
                            which has “no ability to protect” their property are not entitled to
                            make a demand to another country for compensation for the loss of such
                            property and that the country in which such foreigners are residing is
                            responsible for whatever losses result from such lack of protection.</p>
                        <p>It will be recalled that in its note dated August 2, 1933,<note n="20"
                                xml:id="d539fn20">Not printed.</note> the Japanese Government
                            maintained the view that it was under no obligation whatever to pay any

                            Shanghai or elsewhere as a result of the military operations conducted
                            by Japanese forces against the Chinese in Manchuria and Shanghai
                            subsequent to September 18, 1931.<note n="*" xml:id="d539fn1">Embassy’s

                                the original; despatches not printed.]</note> The Japanese
                            Government at that time based its contention on the argument that the
                            Japanese military operations in Manchuria and at Shanghai were nothing
                            more nor less than “self-defensive measures taken against the acts of
                            provocation on the part of the Chinese” and that these “self-defensive”
                            measures constituted, and were carried out as, an integral part of the
                            common measures of defense concerted by the Powers interested.</p>
                        <p>While at the beginning of the present hostilities both in north China and
                            at Shanghai the Japanese authorities asserted that their military and
                            naval forces were acting in self-defense, this point of view has
                            necessarily been relinquished as the conflict has progressed and as the
                            Japanese Government has clarified its aims toward China. It is therefore
                            hardly likely that the Japanese will advance the plea of “self-defense”
                            should they refuse to pay compensation to foreigners residing in China
                            for losses suffered during the present hostilities.</p>

                            area where fighting might be expected. Kiukiang is in [process of] being
                            abandoned by Chinese who are destroying part of the city before they
                            leave. Department will have by this time received Shanghai’s 977 of July
                            11, 11 a.m. which gives text of last warning received from the Japanese
                            referred to in my 347, July 11, 4 p.m. Department will note Japanese
                            desire that American citizens be withdrawn from Hankow, Yochow and
                            Changsha among other places named. Department will observe that
                            literally there is no place on the river below Yochow to which <hi
                                rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> or any other ship could be moved that
                            would be safe. <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> is safer where she now is
                            than she would be any place else and in any case could not now proceed
                            further up river because the Chinese military have laid mines in river
                            between here and Kiukiang which now makes the river dangerous. For
                            months we have been approaching and preparing for the situation which
                            now faces us. Our gunboats are not interlopers in this area. We have
                            known all along that sooner or later they must pass through these
                            hostilities. Japanese can if they wish conduct hostilities in such a way
                            as not to endanger gunboats which have not and are not seeking positions
                            of danger. Every effort is being made to mark them, to notify the
                            Japanese of their position. We here including the officers in command of
                            the gunboats are all completely in accord with the Department’s policy
                            of standing aloof from local hostilities and away from danger. But it
                            must be recognized that sooner or later hostilities are certain to catch
                            up with and pass us. Therefore the only possible course that we can
                            follow is to keep Japanese completely and currently informed of our
                            whereabouts trusting to their desire to do us no harm. Japanese desires
                            to let us alone will be fortified by our insistence upon our rights as
                            non-combatants in a situation which has not been of our choosing. I hope
                            that Department understands that it is not possible to move gunboats or
                            citizens out of Hankow to a safer place. I hope that upon examination
                                [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] that placed as we are every one will
                            loyally make every effort to remain as far from scene of actual fighting
                            as may be humanly possible.</p>

                            <item>It is difficult to furnish the precise data requested by Tokyo’s
                                third paragraph, as in order to do so it would be necessary to
                                maintain a continuous watch over goods from the time they are landed
                                until they are delivered to the various shops. However, members of
                                the staff of this office have on numerous occasions seen Asahi and
                                Kirin Beer, “Anchor Brand” gasoline, tinned goods and other
                                commodities unloaded from ships along the Bund, and the same brands
                                of goods have later been seen to be available for purchase by
                                Chinese and foreigners at Japanese stores within the city. Some time
                                ago I was personally informed by the manager of a Japanese provision
                                shop, from whom I had purchased some tinned goods, that his stock
                                was brought from Shanghai on Japanese vessels. It might also be
                                mentioned in this connection that I have been informed by a British
                                naval officer that Jardine Matheson and Company has recently been
                                permitted by the Japanese to send a tug to Nanking for the purpose
                                of towing to Shanghai one of their lighters which had been left
                                here. Since this could be done it is difficult to see why Jardine’s
                                could not send a tug up to tow the wood oil to Shanghai as was
                                originally suggested by the Werner G. Smith Company.</item>

                            regard to the protection of American nationals at Kiukiang, Kuling and
                            Nanchang: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I have the honour to transmit to you herewith the advice given
                                    by our military authorities concerning the matter, which goes as
                                    follows:</p>
                                <p>With regard to the respect for and protection of the lives and
                                    property of third power nationals in the areas of actual
                                    fighting, and aerial bombardments in certain areas, the Japanese
                                    authorities concerned made communication to the third powers
                                    concerned on June 20, and July 10, respectively.</p>
                                <p>It is highly appreciated that the American authorities have shown
                                    an attitude of cooperation in the matter and it is hoped that
                                    that attitude will be continued in order to preclude any
                                    unpleasant mishaps which might otherwise happen
                                    unexpectedly.</p>
                                <p>As the most intensive military operations will most probably take
                                    place in such places at Kiukiang, Kuling and Nanchang, third
                                    power nationals staying in these places might not be entirely
                                    free from being exposed to extreme danger despite every possible
                                    precaution which shall be taken by the Japanese forces.
                                    Accordingly, it is requested once again that the American
                                    nationals in and around Kiukiang and Kuling take shelter in
                                    Amercan warships near-by and those in and around Nanchang
                                    evacuate to some safer places.</p>
                                <p>Everything which is vested with enemy character can not evade
                                    being attacked by the Japanese forces. Especially, in view of
                                    the fact that Chinese forces tend to approach or make use of
                                    properties be <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0412"/>longing

                                    is hoped that special consideration will be paid to prevent such
                                    actions by the Chinese.</p>

                            <item>The situation with reference to the records of the Bureau of Land
                                Administration remains unchanged except the Japanese are becoming
                                more insistent that the land records be turned over to the Japanese
                                military. In this the interested Consuls are not inclined to
                                acquiesce, on the ground that (1) the Japanese have no special claim
                                on the land records and (2) the Shanghai Municipal Council took
                                custody of the land records without the consent of the Consular Body
                                or the Consuls specially interested. The Japanese by way of a
                                compromise recently proposed that the Municipal Council make some
                                arrangement by which the records should be opened for daily
                                inspection by the public with a Japanese employee of the Municipal
                                Council present, but this has not seemed to offer a satisfactory
                                solution of the problem <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0413"
                                />although it is better than turning the records over to the
                                exclusive control of the Japanese.</item>

                            <item>The recordation of land transfers has been in progress since the
                                beginning of hostilities but there is still no strong pressure from
                                the general public or property owners for the restoration of normal
                                land office facilities. However, the issue may reach a more acute
                                stage vis-à-vis the Japanese soon. It would seem that the only
                                solution which would be fair to all nationalities concerned (and I
                                am very doubtful whether either the Japanese or the Central
                                Government would agree) would be [to consent to the] creation as a
                                temporary expedient only of a special land bureau possibly with
                                codirectors to be selected by the Consular Body as representatives,
                                respectively, of the Settlement areas and the Chinese area, with
                                nationals of the several most interested governments being included
                                among the employees of the bureau. The question will doubtless
                                shortly resolve itself into whether the land archives shall be
                                turned over to a Japanese sponsored Chinese land office, presumably
                                created by the Reformed Government, or whether the interested
                                Consuls shall attempt to retain some control over the administration
                                of the land office as suggested above, or by some other more
                                practicable means, in view of the peculiar situation that now
                                obtains here, and certainly the present position regarding the land
                                archives cannot be maintained permanently.</item>

                        <p>Shanghai’s 1003, July 18, 6 p.m. I talked by telephone this morning [<hi

                            at Kuling and informed him of substance of Shanghai’s July 18, 6 p.m. He
                            states that Americans in Kuling do not intend to leave and in fact most
                            of them cannot do so; that all is quiet at Kuling at present; that there
                            are large numbers of Chinese refugees, particularly women, at
                            Kuling.</p>

                        <p>1013. My 1003, July 18, 6 p.m., quoting letter from Japanese Consul
                            General dated July 18.</p>
                        <p>1. The following letter dated July 19 has been received this morning from
                            the Japanese Consul General. <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“With reference to my letter No. 7, of July 18, I have the honor
                                    to add a few words which I trust will serve to elucidate the
                                    contents of that letter and avoid any misunderstanding that may
                                    arise in the future.</p>
                                <p>It is stated in the last paragraph of my letter above referred
                                    to, that ‘in case the American authorities desire to bring
                                    American nationals into the area under the control of the
                                    Japanese Army in an appropriate way—for example by carrying in
                                    warships—our military authorities will not fail to afford
                                    adequate protection for them.’ This, however, does not in any
                                    way modify the terms regarding the movement of foreign men of
                                    war and vessels, as stated in (1), (2) and (3) of the memorandum
                                    attached to the letter No. 7 of [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] or
                                    Morishima[‘s letter] of July 8, addressed to your
                                    Ambassador.</p>
                                <p>The statement quoted above is not to be understood as to allow
                                    American men of war or vessels [to] move down to Nanking or
                                    Shanghai when they come, with American refugees on board, into
                                    the area under Japanese control.”</p>

                        <p>1. I had another conference with the Japanese Consul General yesterday
                            concerning the wood oil case. The history of the case was reviewed and
                            the net result may be summed up by a suggestion from <pb n="411"
                                xml:id="pg_411" facs="0415"/>Hidaka that the Japanese naval
                            authorities would probably (he declined to make a definite commitment)
                            be willing to consent to the release of the wood oil if the owners would
                            agree to store it in a godown at Nanking, preferably Ho Gee’s
                            [International Export Company’s]. I told Hidaka that this would entail
                            additional hardships and financial losses to the owners of the property
                            because of storage charges and lack of access to the market and that our
                            chief concern remained as heretofore, which was the release of the wood
                            oil with permission or facilities for its transportation to Shanghai so
                            that it could be put on the market. I asked Hidaka frankly to inform me
                            whether he thought the Japanese naval authorities at any time had
                            suspected Chinese ownership or interest in the wood oil and he answered
                            that no such suspicions had existed. Throughout the conversation I
                            emphasized the strictly commercial character of the commodity, its
                            American ownership and the unwarranted interference with a normal trade
                            transaction of an American firm. I was unable to exact from Hidaka any
                            clear statement of the exact reasons for the prolonged detention of the
                            wood oil by the Japanese naval authorities and their refusal for its
                            transport down the river. In the end, and at Hidaka’s request, I agreed
                            to submit to the Department again the offer of the Japanese to release
                            the wood oil, this time with the possibility that, instead of permitting
                            it to lie afloat in junks in the harbor at Nanking near an American
                            naval vessel, the oil could be stored in a godown there. I told Hidaka
                            that if this offer should be accepted he could well expect me to press
                            him after delivery and storage of the cargo, for permission, or
                            facilities, for the transport of the oil down the river to Shanghai. If
                            the Japanese are willing to release the oil with a permit for its
                            storage ashore, I am disposed to believe that the offer should be
                            accepted inasmuch as there is less likelihood of the oil deteriorating
                            or being stolen while in storage in a godown than in its present
                            location in junks some miles up the river from Nanking.</p>

                                printed.</note> Thomson incident. In my interview today with the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs emphatic oral representations were made,
                            supported by an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>, the text of which
                            is given below.</p>
                        <p>I explained the details of the case fully to the Minister, telling him of
                            the condition in which Dr. Thomson arrived at our Embassy immediately
                            after the incident as described by Allison and expressing my personal
                            view that some of the evidence presented could only be regarded as
                            unprejudiced. There was no doubt whatsoever in our minds that the
                            incident had occurred precisely as stated.</p>
                        <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0417"/>
                        <p>General Ugaki stated with equal emphasis that this and other similar
                            incidents did not reflect the attitude of the Japanese soldiery towards
                            foreigners and, he added, especially not towards Americans. These
                            incidents must be ascribed to the abnormal psychology of Japanese
                            soldiers who are away from home in sometimes very difficult
                            circumstances. He himself had been a soldier in the Russo-Japanese war
                            and was thoroughly familiar with the psychological strain of such
                            situations. I said that I recognized that such a strain exists but that
                            this could not excuse such assaults on American citizens and I felt it
                            to be of the utmost importance that word should be passed all the way
                            down the line from the highest officers to the lowest soldiers that such
                            incidents must not take place. I added that our Government is under
                            great public pressure with regard to the Thomson and similar incidents
                            and that the Department will probably have to make public its position
                            and record in regard to this case. The Minister said that he would give
                            most careful consideration to my statement and added that “more
                            attention must be given to this subject”.</p>

                                    instructions from its Government, has the honor to state that a
                                    month has elapsed since the American Government was informed
                                    that Dr. J. C. Thomson, an American citizen, was slapped by a
                                    Japanese sentry at Nanking on June 15. Endeavors to arrange a
                                    local settlement of the incident at Nanking having proved
                                    ineffectual, this matter was brought to the attention of the
                                    Japanese Government on June 20 with a view to arranging a
                                    satisfactory settlement in accord with the facts and
                                    circumstances of the case.</p>
                                <p>On the basis of information submitted to the American Government,
                                    no doubt is entertained by the American Government that the
                                    incident, as described by Dr. Thomson and as supported by
                                    evidence, occurred and the American Government has therefore
                                    requested that the guilty soldier be punished, that an
                                    expression of regret be tendered, and that measures be taken to
                                    prevent the recurrence of such unfortunate and uncalled for
                                    incidents. In every particular, the Japanese authorities have,
                                    on the basis of evidence which the American Government finds
                                    unacceptable, rejected Dr. Thomson’s version of the incident.
                                    The conclusion suggested by the statements made by the Japanese
                                    authorities is that Dr. Thomson, without cause, chose wilfully
                                    to bring false charges against a Japanese sentry. In the light
                                    not only of the circumstances and all evidence but of the known
                                    character of Dr. Thomson this seems to the American Government
                                    altogether improbable.</p>
                                <p>As a result of the consideration by the American Government of
                                    Thomson incident and other incidents of a similar character, the
                                    American Government has reluctantly formed the opinion <pb
                                        n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0418"/>that these incidents
                                    cannot be regarded as unrelated phenomena. They appear to
                                    represent an attitude of mind and state of feeling which cannot
                                    be but a cause of grave concern. The American Government has on
                                    a prior occasion expressed the view that the causes and
                                    circumstances which give rise to incidents of the character
                                    under consideration might readily have been prevented if the
                                    Japanese authorities were to impress upon the Japanese soldiery
                                    the importance and propriety of maintaining at all times an
                                    attitude of civility toward American nationals and noncombatants
                                    in general. The American Government now wishes to reaffirm that
                                    view.</p>
                                <p>Animated by a desire to avoid exacerbation of feeling between
                                    Japanese and Americans, the American Government has sought a
                                    settlement of Thomson incident not only with a view to bringing
                                    to a satisfactory close that unfortunate incident but also in
                                    the belief that prompt and equitable settlement of the incident
                                    along the lines requested would contribute materially toward the
                                    prevention of similar incidents with their inevitably
                                    unfortunate effect upon American feeling.</p>
                                <p>The foregoing views are brought to the attention of the Japanese
                                    authorities in the hope that, in giving them consideration, they
                                    will be motivated by a seriousness of purpose commensurate with
                                    that which prompts the American Government to state them. Tokyo,

                        <p>1026. I have received this afternoon a letter dated July 21 addressed to
                            the Ambassador by Masayuki Tani, Japanese Minister at Large, reading as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I have the honor to draw Your Excellency’s attention to the fact
                                    that the Chinese have been transporting munitions of war from
                                    Canton to Hankow by increasing numbers of freight cars connected
                                    to passenger trains carrying nationals of third powers. While
                                    the Japanese forces feel constricted [<hi rend="italic"

                            <item>A Secretary of the Japanese Embassy called this morning and stated
                                that a report had been received from the Chief of Staff of the North
                                China forces that Dr. Scovel’s assailant had been sentenced July 13
                                by court martial to 3 years imprisonment for inflicting bodily
                                injuries and for committing unlawful entry; that the assailant
                                arrived July 21 at Peiping and is now serving his sentence in the
                                military prison in Peiping.</item>

                                        means of connecting freight cars to passenger trains
                                        carrying nationals of third powers, in spite of the Japanese
                                        warning against such practice and the request of the third
                                        powers for their representations at the Hankow Government,
                                        the Japanese forces would be forced to bomb such freight
                                        cars. The Chinese should be held responsible for any
                                        consequences that might follow with regard to the safety of
                                        third power nationals.</item>

                                        will be arranged among interested powers concerned and
                                        notified in advance to the Japanese authorities, be
                                        organized to take place once approximately every 10 or 14
                                        days. In such case it is needless to say that the Japanese
                                        forces are prepared to take every possible means to assure
                                        the safety of the said train.”</item>

                                    University of Shanghai. In the light of the situation outlined
                                    in the telegram under reference and in previous communications,
                                    the Department feels that representations of an emphatic
                                    character should again be made to the Japanese Foreign Office in
                                    regard to this matter. In your approach to the Foreign Office it
                                    is suggested that you may care to point out, <hi rend="italic"
                                        >inter alia</hi>, that evacuation of the property by
                                    Japanese troops without returning the property to the control of
                                    the missions concerned does not in any way lessen the
                                    responsibility which attaches to the Japanese Government for
                                    damages to the property and for losses suffered by the missions
                                    by reason of Japanese occupation and control; that the continued
                                    failure of the Japanese authorities to return the property to
                                    the complete control of the missions’ representatives is
                                    undeniably open to the interpretation that the Japanese
                                    authorities intend to render the property useless to its owners
                                    and to force its sale, particularly in view of the fact that the
                                    seat of hostilities has long since been far removed from
                                    Shanghai and of the fact that the Japanese military have
                                    evacuated the property; that this arbitrary interference with
                                    American rights and interests is obviously inconsistent with
                                    repeated assurances of the Japanese Government to the effect
                                    that American rights and interests shall be respected; and that
                                    accordingly this Government asks that appropriate steps be taken
                                    without further delay to effect the prompt return of the
                                    property in question to the full control of its owners.</p>

                            indicate the evacuation from Kuling at this time would be very
                            hazardous. The Ambassador has today sent a letter to Chiang Kai Shek
                            referring to above-mentioned telegram from Kuling regarding foreign
                            evacuation and expressing the hope that the report is not correct; that
                            at present when fighting is being carried out all around the base of the
                            mountain upon which Kuling is situated, evacuation would be an
                            exceedingly serious undertaking. The Ambassador expressed the hope that
                            instructions will be issued which will make it unnecessary for the
                            Americans on Kuling to travel along roads and paths now under fire.</p>

                        <p>At 3 p.m. today it was reported to me that two Americans, Harry E. Clark
                            and Albert R. Wilkins, were struck by Japanese guard 11:30 p.m., July
                            26th after curfew. Incident has been reported to Japanese Consul and
                            commander of Japanese landing party has investigated and found Japanese
                            patrol acted without provocation. I am of opinion incident can be
                            settled locally by accepting expression of regret from Japanese
                            commander, punishment of Japanese guards involved and assurance that

                            the incident was the culmination of a series of interviews with the
                            Japanese authorities about the spies of the clinic, which had been
                            reopened on July 11. The clinic is located at present in a chapel,
                            belonging to the same mission as the hospital, which had been occupied
                            for some time by Japanese Army units but which had been formally
                            returned to the mission at the end of May. The clinic building now flies
                            the American flag and bears a promise from the Japanese Consul stating
                            it is American property and should be protected as such.</p>
                        <p>On July 20th Dr. Brown was questioned by a Japanese military policeman
                            about the clinic and replied to all questions. On July 24th, he was
                            asked to go to military police headquarters where he was informed by a
                            junior officer that the clinic should cease operation until application
                            has been made to the Japanese for permission to operate it. Dr. Brown
                            replied that the Japanese Consul knew of the operation of the clinic,
                            and that while he was willing to furnish the Japanese any desired
                            information and even have the clinic registered he saw no reason why the
                            work should be stopped during the obtaining of such registration. After
                            some discussion he was given registration blanks which he had filled out
                            and returned to the authorities the same afternoon. On the afternoon on
                            July 25, the hospital was informed that another copy of the application
                            blank was desired but this news was apparently received too late to
                            enable the hospital to comply prior to 4 o’clock, the hour at which the
                            military police office closed.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Brown was informed at about 4:30 p.m., that two soldiers and an
                            officer had come to the clinic and asked Dr. Morgan<note n="39"
                                xml:id="d568fn39">L. S. Morgan, American staff member of Wuhu
                                General Hospital.</note> to go to their headquarters to discuss the
                            matter. Dr. Morgan replied that administrative matters were not his
                            concern and he referred the soldiers to Dr. Brown at the hospital. The
                            officer then ordered the soldiers to take Dr. Morgan to police
                            headquarters. The two soldiers grabbed Dr. Morgan, twisting his arms
                            painfully, and forced him to accompany them. Dr. Brown went at once to
                            the clinic to investigate and then started to the police station. En
                            route he met Dr. Morgan who had been released and the two of them went
                            to the Japanese authorities and protested. Dr. Brown concludes his
                            letter with the statement: “We expect to continue going to the
                            clinic.”</p>
                        <p>Up to the present no reply has been received from the Japanese Consul
                            General to my note of July 26, informing him of the incident and
                            requesting an investigation.</p>

                        <p>500. Department’s 259, July 28, 4 p.m.<note n="40" xml:id="d569fn40">Not
                                printed.</note> Publication of <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>
                            on Thomson incident.</p>
                        <p>1. In weighing the Department’s inquiry I have given full consideration
                            to the importance, particularly at present, of endeavoring to reduce
                            elements of irritation in our relations with Japan so far as is possible
                            without depriving the American public of the publication of such
                            information as it may rightfully expect. I believe that the Foreign
                            Minister is endeavoring to put a stop to such incidents as the Thomson
                            case, and in the meantime I think that no constructive good can be
                            accomplished by steps which would be interpreted here as lack of faith
                            in his efforts.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, although I told the Minister in our conversation on July 21
                            that my Government might find it necessary to give publicity to its
                            position and to the record in the Thomson case, and although the
                            Minister at that time raised no objections, I nevertheless felt it wise
                            today to approach the Foreign Office through Yoshizawa informally and as
                            a matter of courtesy to announce the Department’s intention to publish
                            our <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>.</p>
                        <p>2. Yoshizawa, after reference to the Minister, said that if we published
                            the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>, the Foreign Office would then
                            feel obliged to publish the Japanese side of the case which would be
                            entirely contradictory, thereby creating an impasse which he likened to
                            the Keelung incident.<note n="41" xml:id="d569fn41">The incident
                                involved brutal treatment of British sailors by Japanese police at
                                Keelung, Taiwan (Formosa), in October, 1936.</note> He said that
                            this would give rise to adverse popular feeling in both our countries
                            which would be of no help in the settlement of future differences and he
                            added that he could foresee marked irritation on the part of the
                            Japanese military in China which also would not be helpful. Yoshizawa
                            furthermore stated that he had talked with a staff officer just returned
                            from China who had been present in Nanking at the time of the Thomson
                            incident. This officer said that while there might have been some
                            original apprehension that the sentry had laid hands on Doctor Thomson,
                            the military were now genuinely convinced that not only did the sentry
                            not slap Thomson but that he did not even lay hands on him.</p>
                        <p>3. Yoshizawa then informally suggested that we step aside for the moment
                            to consider another approach. He proposed that the <pb n="424"
                                xml:id="pg_424" facs="0428"/>Japanese authorities issue a public
                            statement in connection with the Thomson incident that while the
                            Japanese Government maintains its position and conviction as to the
                            facts of the case, the Japanese military will nevertheless impress upon
                            the Japanese soldiery the importance and propriety of maintaining at all
                            times an attitude of civility toward American nationals, and that for
                            our part we issue a simultaneous statement that after lengthy discussion
                            the conclusion has been reached that no good purpose would be served by
                            further controversy over the incident and that while the American
                            Government can not relinquish its position and conviction as to the
                            facts of the Thomson affair, we will nevertheless, in view of the
                            Japanese intention to caution its own soldiery, take appropriate
                            occasion to caution our nationals as to the importance of paying due
                            consideration to the duties of Japanese sentries in the occupied
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>4. The foregoing formula was reached only after several conversations and
                            after I had categorically declined even to transmit to Washington the
                            formula which the Foreign Office first proposed.</p>
                        <p>5. Yoshizawa stated that there was no alternative to the foregoing
                            procedure without incurring sharp friction.</p>
                        <p>6. I myself believe implicitly in Dr. Thomson’s version. Nevertheless,
                            while strongly reluctant to cede any point on these current incidents, I
                            cannot avoid the opinion that in the interest of a solution of the many
                            issues with which we are faced in connection with Japanese activities in
                            China we shall gain more in the long run by aiming to avoid acute
                            friction when such friction can be avoided without sacrificing national
                            dignity. I also believe that such efforts as General Ugaki may be making
                            to implement his various assurances to us will be more likely to bear
                            fruit if we can succeed in the meantime in tempering publicity both in
                            the United States and Japan.</p>

                            reason given being “because of developments on the railway which the
                            Japanese Consulate General is not at liberty to discuss.” However,
                            foreigners are arriving in Tsingtao from Tsinanfu by rail with no
                            interference.</p>

                            to travel on trains for the west. Some Americans whose presence in
                            Missions is of importance are seeking the assistance of this Consulate
                            which believes their return will continue to be delayed by Japanese

                            by Yoshizawa. However, we find objectionable the possible implications

                            further letter, dated August 2, has just been received from Dr. Brown
                            stating that continued attempts have been made to get the hospital to
                            close its clinic until permission has been obtained from the Japanese
                            authorities. Dr. Brown was told by a representative of the Japanese
                            Consulate that the military had agreed to give the clinic a permit if it
                            would close for 3 days. Upon asking why it was necessary to close, Dr.
                            Brown was informed that as Wuhu was in occupied territory nothing could
                            be done without the permission of the army, and it was suggested the
                            clinic might be closed by force. Dr. Brown states he intends to continue
                            operating the clinic unless instructed by Department to close it and he
                            requested my instructions.</p>
                        <p>It is felt that the principle involved is one of considerable importance
                            which will affect the operation of the American institutions in the

                            not I am authorized to inform the local Japanese authorities that the
                            American Government cannot recognize the right of the Japanese
                            authorities to interfere with the legitimate activities of American

                            <item>We supplied Yoshizawa yesterday afternoon with the text of the
                                draft statement set forth in paragraph 1 of the Department’s
                                telegram under reference. His comment then was that his thought had
                                been that the question could be settled on what he called a “50–50”
                                basis, while the Department’s draft statement appeared by
                                implication to place responsibility for the incident on the
                                Japanese. He stated that he would consult the War Department at once
                                and communicate again with us this morning.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>This morning he informed us that the draft statement was
                                “absolutely impossible”. After considerable discussion which
                                indicated that there was no likelihood of consideration being given
                                by the Japanese to the first draft, the second draft was presented.
                                We made it perfectly clear that we could make no further concession
                                in substance. Yoshizawa said that the second draft was a “great
                                improvement”. However, he queried the word “known” qualifying the
                                phrase “desire and intention of American nationals”. He doubted
                                whether that formula would be an acceptable substitute for his
                                original formula to counterbalance Japanese undertaking to caution
                                their soldiers. There then ensued an extended discussion, in the
                                course of which Yoshizawa reiterated that the settlement must be a
                                “50–50” proposition and in which we emphasized that the Department
                                could not give issuance to a statement which might be open to
                                implications inconsistent with the repeatedly expressed position of
                                our Government that <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0435"/>it
                                would not give countenance to any Japanese assertion of jurisdiction
                                or control over American nationals.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>When we stressed the advantages of immediate settlement, Yoshizawa
                                said that he was also eager to see the incident closed; that he
                                would confer with the War Department today and that he would
                                communicate with us (he hoped tomorrow) as soon as the Japanese had
                                decided on their reply.<note n="47" xml:id="d580fn47">In despatch
                                    No. 3194, August 18, the Ambassador reported that in his next
                                    conversation with Mr. Yoshizawa he repeated what he had stated
                                    on several previous occasions, that the Japanese Government
                                    appeared to think that its forces in China enjoyed all the
                                    rights conveyed to a belligerent under the rules of war but
                                    avoided, at the same time, all the obligations of a belligerent.
                                    Common sense and a regard for existing facts aside, the
                                    Ambassador said, no basis whatever existed for the apparent
                                    Japanese assumption that an American national in Nanking was
                                    under obligation to regulate his conduct toward a Japanese
                                    soldier with any more circumspection than he would were the
                                    Japanese soldier any other individual. (394.1123 Thomson, J.

                            that steps be taken promptly to forestall arbitrary and indefensible
                            action by the Japanese military at Wuhu, which, if taken, would be a

                        <p>1074. The organization has been completed of the Central China
                            Telecommunications Company and it has commenced operations as of August
                            1. It is announced that it “will take control over all
                            telecommunications in Central China”. These will include the former
                            Chinese Government radio administration, the telegraph administration of
                            the Chinese Ministry of Communications, and the various Chinese
                            municipal and long distance telephone systems, practically all of which
                            were officially owned. This would appear to be the final step in the
                            taking over and consolidation of these services under Japanese control
                            and is evidently closely patterned after the procedure followed in
                            Manchuria. Although the immediate effect will be ostensibly to transfer
                            these facilities from Japanese military to civilian hands, it is
                            apparent that control will remain at least semi-official.</p>
                        <p>The capital is announced to be 15,000,000 yen. Of this amount 5,000,000
                            yen represents the seized Chinese properties, i. e., largely
                            “contributed in kind” by the “Reformed Government”. 4,000,000 yen is to
                            be contributed by Japanese electrical interests which include the
                            Japanese Telegraph and Telephone Company and the International
                            Electrical Communications Company. The remaining 6,000,000 yen is to be
                            put up by the Central Chinese Development (redirected) Company, the
                            organization of which has not yet been completed. American interests
                            estimate, however, that little actual capital is being paid up at the
                            present time.</p>
                        <p>Although the new company is said to be of Chinese “Reformed Government”
                            registry, the president and the general manager are to be Japanese and
                            only two Chinese, personal representatives of the “Reformed Government”,
                            are to serve on the Board of Directors. A Mr. Hiroshi Fukuda is
                            president. The head office is at Shanghai. The American radio companies,
                            R. C. A. and Mackay, who had traffic contracts with C. G. R. A. for the
                            operation of circuits to the United States, have been informed by the
                            new company that it does not desire to make new contracts with them but
                            merely to continue the old agreements in force until their normal
                            expiration. Operation of these circuits since the seizure of C. G. R. A.
                            by the Japanese military in January has already been on this basis.
                            Since the Japanese have observed the terms of the contracts to the
                            satisfaction of the American interests, both American companies are now
                            understood to be informing the Central Chinese Telephone Communications
                            Company that <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0437"/>they are willing
                            to continue cooperation on the basis of their old contracts with C. G.
                            R. A.</p>
                        <p>While American radio companies are inclined to complain on the ground of
                            Japanese violation of their rights, they state that they are suffering
                            heavy losses because of the general refusal of the public to use the
                            Japanese controlled radio services and its consequent patronage of the
                            cables. They state that their share in the radio-cable traffic between
                            China and the United States has fallen from about 85 to about 15% since
                            Japanese seizure of C. G. R. A. American electric railway equipment
                            manufacturers expect to suffer since they feel that Japanese control of
                            these services will result in no further purchases by them of American
                            equipment.</p>

                                    a request of local police chief that Americans there pay
                                    automobile license fee of Chinese dollars 50 and bicycle fee of
                                    Chinese dollars 5 per annum, such fees allegedly to be applied
                                    to road repairs. Roberts feels that Americans should not be
                                    advised to pay these fees because they already voluntarily
                                    contribute to road repairing, because foreigners in principal

                                        purview of Legation circular 176, July 6, 1927, which states
                                        the Department’s opinion that American citizens should be
                                        advised to pay as voluntary contributions municipal tax

                                        reasonable. We do not feel that payments of such fees should
                                        be refused because of the road repair contributions
                                        mentioned which if again requested for following current

                                6, and again this morning I brought up the question of the return of
                                Shanghai University to its owners. The situation remains unchanged
                                inasmuch as the Japanese are unwilling to alter the position which
                                they have heretofore firmly maintained. Hidaka has stated on each
                                occasion that the military authorities are denying access not only
                                to this property but to Point Island and to other nearby areas <pb
                                    n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0439"/>and that even Japanese
                                nationals are not permitted access to properties in that district.
                                The military are adamant and I see no immediate prospect of a change
                                in their position. The mission authorities gave out a statement
                                recently setting forth their position in this controversy and this
                                statement was published in part by one of the local newspapers on

                                for the transportation of the wood oil to Shanghai, either on board
                                a Japanese vessel or otherwise. On each occasion I emphasized the

                                each occasion has been that it is difficult to persuade the Japanese
                                naval authorities to make an unconditional release of the oil and he
                                has reiterated the naval authorities’ “disappointment” that the

                                discussed this case with him and suggested that he press the matter

                            <item>A member of the staff of the Japanese Consulate called this
                                morning at this Consulate and in discussing the wood oil cases with
                                a member of the staff inquired whether it would be possible to
                                arrange a settlement of the matter by the Japanese naval authorities
                                purchasing the wood oil for naval uses. He was informed that this
                                would depend entirely upon the terms of the offer and also upon the
                                American owners’ decision. He was informed that if an offer is
                                received for the purchase of the oil it would be transmitted to the
                                owners, the Werner G. Smith Company of Hankow. It seems probable
                                that an offer to purchase the oil will shortly be

                        <p>1094. On July 22, at the request of the Standard Oil Company, I wrote the
                            Japanese Consul General at Shanghai requesting him to obtain permission

                            Chinkiang, Nanking and Wuhu with a cargo of oil. On July 31 the Consul
                            General replied stating that “since the localities mentioned above are
                            within the sphere of the military operations, the Japanese naval
                            authorities find it still inopportune to comply with the request at the
                            present time.” The oil company states it will suffer considerable loss
                            of business if it is not able to send this shipload of oil products to
                            replenish stocks at these ports and requests that this office continue
                            to press the matter. I have therefore again written to the Japanese
                            Consul General.</p>

                        <p>This is the first case in which an American commercial vessel has sought
                            permission to navigate on the Yangtze above the Kiangyin boom. It is
                            understood that the British have been negotiating with the Japanese on
                            the same problem, both here and in Tokyo, with no success. Some Japanese
                            commercial vessels, however, appear to be operating (see my No. 1046,

                        <p>It may be mentioned that the hostilities passed beyond Wuhu almost 8

                        <p>527. Our 517, August 5, 6 p.m.—Thomson case.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>We conferred yesterday and again today on proposed statements with
                                regard to the Thomson incident. The Foreign Office stated at the
                                outset that the Japanese Government has repeatedly cautioned its
                                troops in China to respect American citizens and to deal with them
                                with circumspection and civility and that in this connection there
                                has been no change of attitude or intention. However, in the
                                proposed statement to be given out by the American and Japanese
                                Governments, respectively, for the purpose of putting an end to the
                                Thomson case, the Japanese Government would not be disposed, in view
                                of the fact that neither party has relinquished its original stand,
                                to announce that the Japanese Government was taking additional
                                measures to caution Japanese troops unless the American Government
                                could at the same time announce that American nationals were being
                                officially advised to avoid raising difficulties with Japanese
                                sentries. The Japanese Government was confident, however, that if
                                action along the lines proposed by the Foreign Office were taken by
                                both Governments, it would conduce to the preventing of future
                                incidents.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The Foreign Office refused to accept the phrase “the known desire
                                and intention of American nationals” in the Department’s draft or to
                                consider any equivalent substitute. It took the position that the
                                phrase implied that there has already been an official American
                                announcement of intention to regulate the attitude of American
                                nationals in China toward Japanese soldiers. While admitting that
                                the attitude of the great majority of American nationals in China
                                has been one calculated to avoid difficulties with the Japanese, the
                                Foreign Office contends that there have been a number of instances
                                of <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0442"/>difficulties in which
                                American nationals have taken the initiative, and that in the light
                                of these cases the Japanese Government cannot give its agreement to
                                a statement which would convey to the public the impression that the
                                fault in the Thomson case, as in other cases, rests with the
                                Japanese military. Comment: It seems to us that the phrase to which
                                the Japanese have taken exception is ambiguous. As there is, in our
                                opinion, no likelihood of its being acceptable to the Japanese
                                Government, we recommend that it be dropped.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The Foreign Office stated that, if the Department will agree to
                                the inclusion of some phrase which would refer to the giving by
                                American nationals of consideration to the duties of Japanese
                                sentries as a factor in preventing future incidents, the Foreign
                                Office will go as far as possible toward meeting any objection which
                                we might have to such a statement on the ground that it would
                                prejudice the rights of American nationals in China. The Foreign
                                Office accordingly proposed the inclusion, after the word “avoid”,
                                the clause “with due consideration for the duties of Japanese
                                sentries”. We suggested as a possible substitute the clause “by
                                refraining from action obstructive of the duties of Japanese
                                sentries but without prejudice to rights of American nationals”. The
                                Foreign Office is prepared to accept our suggested phrase. Comment:
                                It would have been helpful to us if the Department had specified the
                                “possible implications” which made Yoshizawa’s original formula
                                objectionable. If, as we assume, the most important of these
                                implications was the possible effect of the formula, if included in
                                the announcement, upon rights of American nationals in China, the
                                phrase we have suggested would appear to provide adequate safeguard.
                                In this belief, we recommend the phrase suggested by us to the
                                favorable consideration of the Department.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Although the point is a minor one, the Foreign Office feels that
                                the phrase “when carried out” might better be omitted, but states
                                that if the Department insists on its retention in reference to “the
                                intention of the Japanese military authorities”, it should be
                                inserted after the word “advice” and before “of American
                                officials”.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>As a check against possible error, the draft statement to whose
                                issuance by the Department the Foreign Office is agreeable would run
                                as follows: (No change from the Department’s draft up to the words
                                “civility toward American nationals” injured [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >sic</hi>] and continue) “together with the advice of American
                                officials in China to American nationals present in those areas to
                                avoid, by refraining from action obstructive of the duties of
                                Japanese sentries but without prejudice to the rights of American
                                nationals, giving occasion for difficulties with such sentries would
                                contribute” (continue to the end of the Department’s draft without
                                change). The proposed statement which would be issued by the Foreign
                                Office would read as follows: “After and in the light of a long
                                discussion of the matter we are convinced that no <pb n="439"
                                    xml:id="pg_439" facs="0443"/>effectual purpose would be served
                                by further contention over the incident, and that, while this
                                Government continues to adhere to its understanding of the Thomson
                                incident, we are confident that the proposed advice of American
                                officials in China to American nationals present in the Japanese
                                occupied areas to avoid, by refraining from action obstructive of
                                the duties of Japanese sentries but without prejudice to the rights
                                of American nationals, giving occasion for difficulties with such
                                sentries, together with the intention of the Japanese military
                                authorities to impress upon Japanese soldiers in the occupied areas
                                the importance and propriety of maintaining an attitude of civility
                                toward American nationals, would contribute” (continue to end of
                                Department’s draft without change).</item>

                                received a letter dated August 4 from the Special Service Section of
                                the Japanese Army notifying the companies that with the

                                will be controlled by the new company. The Special Service Section
                                requests that all the documents regarding the calculations of the
                                international telegram charges which have been sent to the office

                                the fees for each registration must be deposited with the new
                                company.</item>

                            <item>The above notification virtually amounts to the administrative
                                control of the acceptance and delivery office of the three foreign

                                company. The three foreign cable companies are more concerned over
                                this development than over previous demands of the Japanese military
                                authorities for control, inasmuch as the Reformed Government appears
                                one of the principal stockholders in the new enterprise.</item>

                            <item>At a meeting yesterday at which were present the managers of the
                                three cable companies concerned and the Danish Minister, the British
                                Consul General and myself, the matter was discussed at length, and
                                it appeared to be the concensus of opinion that every effort should
                                be made by the cable companies to maintain the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >status quo</hi> as long as possible and at least until such
                                time as the Danish, British and American diplomatic and consular

                                governments of their attitude on the question. My own view is that,
                                unless the three companies feel that their interests in Japan and
                                elsewhere might be seriously jeopardized, the managers of the three
                                companies should be advised to inform the Japanese that the
                                companies are not in a position to meet the wishes <pb n="442"

                            <item>The Japanese Consul General came to see me today and inquired
                                whether the wood oil case could now be settled on the basis of the
                                requisitioning of the oil by the Japanese naval authorities, payment
                                to be made on the basis of cost price as shown by the invoices and
                                shipping documents, such payment to be made in United States
                                currency if the papers show that the oil was purchased on that
                                basis. Hidaka stated that the question of any loss by theft or
                                leakage would necessarily have to be adjusted later. I pointed out
                                that there might possibly also be some charge for the use of the
                                junks but Hidaka would not commit himself on this point because he
                                said the Japanese military may claim possession of the junks as
                                Chinese property. Hidaka emphasized that the Japanese naval
                                authorities do not wish to be placed in the position of purchasing
                                the oil because such action might create an embarrassing precedent
                                but that he felt sure the question could be settled on the basis of
                                requisitioning the oil for naval uses and payment therefor as such.
                                Hidaka reported that the naval authorities are very anxious to
                                settle this long standing case and he expressed the hope that the
                                Department and the owners of the oil would accept the proposal in
                                principle after which the exact value of the oil could be determined
                                and payment made. I believe that this proposal offers the only
                                possibility of settling this case in the near future.</item>

                                xml:id="d598fn57">Not printed.</note> Consul General Hanawa informed
                            me this morning that he had seen the Japanese <pb n="444"
                                xml:id="pg_444" facs="0448"/>naval authorities again, but that they
                            would not release the oil unconditionally, asserting that navigation on
                            the Yangtze between Nanking and Shanghai was still dangerous due to
                            floating Chinese mines, Japanese munitions vessels, et cetera. He said
                            that the naval authorities considered the status of the case to be the
                            same as when discussions were carried on some time ago in Shanghai with
                            the American consular authorities there with a view to a possible
                            release for storage ashore at Nanking. He added that the Japanese naval
                            authorities would probably require for such conditional release some
                            document in the nature of a bill of sale from the Chinese seller to the
                            American authorities as proof of his ownership, but, even assuming that
                            such a document were forthcoming, he could give no assurance that the
                            conditional release would be granted.</p>
                        <p>I repeated the various reasons why the American authorities considered
                            that the oil should be released, and stated that unconditional release
                            was desired and not merely release for storage ashore at Nanking. I
                            expressed surprise that the question of American ownership should now be
                            raised. I stated that navigation on the Yangtze below Nanking appeared
                            to be safe and that Japanese commercial vessels were plying between
                            Nanking and Shanghai. He offered the usual argument that these vessels
                            had been taken over by the Japanese military authorities for the
                            transportation of military supplies. He continued that, although this
                            part of the river was still considered dangerous for commercial
                            navigation he believed that the Japanese naval authorities might shortly
                            alter their views, indicating that this would perhaps occur after the
                            anticipated capture of Hankow.</p>
                        <p>It seems evident that the attitude adopted by the Japanese naval
                            authorities in this case is in line with the apparent intention of the
                            Japanese authorities to place every obstacle in the way of non-Japanese
                            foreign trade along the Yangtze, to prohibit non-Japanese foreign
                            shipping on the Yangtze, and probably to establish the Japanese shipping
                            monopoly on the river. There seems to be little doubt that Japanese
                            vessels carry commercial freight on the Yangtze (see Nanking’s 134, July
                            12, 3 p.m. and Shanghai’s 988, July 13, 7 [<hi rend="italic">9</hi>]
                                p.m.<note n="59" xml:id="d598fn59">Latter not printed.</note>) and
                            the obstacles placed in the way of non-Japanese foreign trade in this
                            area, such as in the oil and tobacco business, among others, are well
                            known.</p>
                        <p>This office will continue to press the Japanese authorities here for the
                            unconditional release of the wood oil, but I do not believe that this
                            will be obtained without orders from the higher authorities in Tokyo.
                            Consul General Hanawa, in favor of it, intimates that he would
                            accomplish nothing with his naval authorities here and suggests that it
                            would be advisable to take up the matter in Tokyo.</p>

                            that there is serious danger to American lives and property in
                            Pei-tai-ho, but conditions in that area are such that this warning
                            should not be entirely ignored. It is known that in the past few weeks
                            the members of the Eighth Route Army and bandits (which are often
                            indistinguishable from each other) have rapidly increased in East Hopei,
                            and that the situation at and near Tongshan is precarious. It is
                            reported that 5,000 such soldiers in small but definitely organized
                            units crossed the railway toward the east not far from Tongshan very
                            recently.</p>

                        <p>1137. 1. I have received a letter dated August 20 from the Japanese
                            Consul General in which he states that the Japanese forces, “owing to
                            urgent military necessity have decided to construct military
                            establishments in the northern part of Point Island”. The letter then
                            sets forth that it will be necessary to remove all the small private
                            houses on certain plots of ground, which are described by lot number,
                            and that due compensation will be paid to the property owners concerned.
                            A request is made that I inform all American property owners who will be
                            affected and request them to apply to the Japanese “for compensation in
                            due time”.</p>
                        <p>2. The above property is all owned by the Whangpoo Conservancy and is
                            located in the immediate vicinity of Shanghai University. A number of
                            the plots of ground have been leased to American citizens and other
                            foreigners also have leases. While it has not yet been possible to
                            ascertain exactly how many Americans are affected by this notification,
                            it is believed that at least 10 are concerned. Most of these Americans
                            have erected small cottages on the property and reside there during the
                            summer, or the year round, in normal times. The area comprises slightly
                            over half of Point Island. I have not communicated any notice to the
                            Americans concerned and will not do so pending the Department’s
                            instructions.</p>
                        <p>3. This action on the part of the Japanese does not come as a surprise in
                            so far as the Consulate has felt for some time that the Japanese
                            intended to take full control of this area. It is doubtful whether any
                            protest will be effective but I suggest that I be authorized to inform
                            the Japanese Consul General that the American Government does not
                            recognize its right to expropriate the American property located on the
                            land in question. I feel that it will be necessary, however, to notify
                            the American leaseholders of the Japanese intention. My <pb n="447"

                        <p>1140. An officer of the Japanese Consulate General confidentially
                            informed this office today that the Japanese military and naval
                            authorities have advised to remove, effective September 30, the
                            restrictions on the removal of cargo from Hongkew and Yangtzepoo
                            Districts and the entrance of Chinese into those areas.</p>
                        <p>The removal of these restrictions would be very welcome as at present it
                            is still necessary for an American who wishes to remove his cargo at
                            Hongkew or Yangtzepoo to have his application “chopped” in this office
                            and by the Japanese consular, military and naval authorities, the last
                            three offices being widely separated. On August 22 the Japanese
                            Consulate General intends to open a branch office so that the three
                            Japanese “chops” mentioned above may all be obtained in the same
                            building. This will save applicants considerable time.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Brown, who visited Nanking August 18 on British gunboat, stated that
                            interference with clinic had ceased. He mentioned an incident which had
                            occurred on August 9 when nine sailors from a French gunboat then at
                            Wuhu, whom he had invited to swim at the hospital pool, had been held up
                            by Japanese sentry at hospital compound gate. Dr. Brown opened gate for

                            Japanese soldiers. The French gunboat commander subsequently obtained
                            permission for them to leave. Dr. Brown stated that he had been assured
                            by former Japanese military commander at Wuhu that passes were not
                            required by foreign naval men and that he was acting on this

                            attack in question that not only was the life of an American national
                            directly imperiled but loss was also occasioned to American property
                            interests as the Pan American Airways has a very substantial (45
                            percent) interest in the CNAC. Please also call special attention to the
                            following points in the account of pilot Wood: the CNAC plane was
                            pursued by Japanese planes which started machine-gunning; after the CNAC
                            plane had successfully landed it was followed down by Japanese pursuit
                            planes which continued to machine-gun it until it had sunk; and when
                            pilot Wood started swimming across the river he was followed by one of
                            the Japanese planes which continued to machine-gun him. You should
                            express the emphatic objection of this Government to the jeopardizing in
                            this way of the lives of American as well as other <pb n="452"

                            Department the efforts, thus far unsuccessful, made by this Consulate
                            General to secure the evacuation by Japanese forces of property at
                            Soochow, Kiangsu, belonging to the American Presbyterian Mission,
                            North.</p>
                        <p>The Consulate General was first asked to take action in regard to the
                            looting and occupation of this property by Mr. R. M. White, the
                            Mission’s representative in Shanghai, in a letter dated March 3,
                                1938.<note n="70" xml:id="d611fn70">This letter and other
                                communications enclosed with despatch not printed.</note> On March
                            14 a protest was made to the Japanese Consul General at Shanghai
                            requesting its immediate evacuation and return to the Mission. A reply,
                            which dealt with this and several similar cases, was received on May 2.
                            In regard to the property in question the Japanese Consul General said:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“There is no truth in the allegation that Japanese troops have
                                    occupied the churches of the Presbyterian Mission and that they
                                    have destroyed and/or looted the property in the church
                                    buildings. On the contrary the circumstantial evidence shows
                                    conclusively that the church buildings have been plundered by
                                    Chinese troops. Nobody is using these buildings at present.
                                    Although two houses on the compound of the Mission’s hospital
                                    were seen burning down by fire some time ago, it is needless to
                                    state that the Japanese side had nothing whatever to do with the
                                    incident.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">It is interesting to compare these statements with the
                            eyewitness accounts of the American missionaries, who were in Soochow on
                            November 24 after the Japanese occupation, and who actually saw Japanese
                                <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0457"/>soldiers looting the
                            premises and burning the two buildings mentioned (see this office’s
                            despatch No. 1203, February 5, 1938, enclosure 4<note n="71"
                                xml:id="d611fn71">Neither printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile further information had been received from the Mission
                            concerning the occupation and continuing destruction of the property. A
                            copy of this letter, dated April 19, is enclosed. Another protest was
                            addressed to the Japanese Consul General on April 22 and he answered to
                            this in a letter dated May 5, again dealing with a number of similar
                            cases, in which he stated: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“As regards the buildings of the American Presbyterian Mission
                                    (North), of which Mr. Gauss informed me on April 22nd, I am
                                    given to understand that the Japanese troops have been taking as
                                    much care as possible for the preservation of the property and
                                    the allegation that they are actively engaged in tearing out and
                                    removing all woodwork, including floors, stairways, doors and
                                    windows in those buildings, is not based on the actual
                                    conditions.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">It will be noticed that there was a slight change from
                            the attitude of his first letter in that the occupation by Japanese
                            troops was now, by inference, admitted. However, both letters completely
                            ignored the question of the return of the property to the control of the
                            Mission.</p>
                        <p>There were no American missionaries in Soochow and nothing further was
                            done in the matter until after their return to that city in July. On the
                            basis of information that the occupation of the property was continuing,
                            a letter was addressed to the Japanese Consul General on July 29.
                            Shortly afterwards the Mission complained of the difficulties met with
                            by Dr. O. C. Crawford in his efforts to interview the Japanese military
                            officers at Soochow in charge of the property and their refusal to
                            permit him to enter the premises or to remove any articles therefrom.
                            Another communication was therefore sent to the Japanese Consul General
                            on August 11.</p>
                        <p>On August 18 the Mission stated that Dr. Crawford had at last been
                            permitted to inspect the premises, that he had found most of the
                            buildings still occupied by Japanese troops, and that he was able to get
                            definite confirmation of earlier reports of damage and destruction
                            caused by the Japanese forces. The Mission requested that
                            representations be continued, that it be given permission to use the
                            buildings not actually occupied by the Japanese, and that it be notified
                            prior to the Japanese evacuation of the property so that its
                            representatives could be present to inspect the buildings and take
                            possession of them. These matters were taken up with the Japanese Consul
                            General in a letter dated August 25.</p>
                        <p>Today, after nine months of occupancy, this Consulate General has not
                            been able to obtain from the Japanese any statement of their intentions
                                <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0458"/>with regard to this
                            American property, nor any promise whether or when they will evacuate
                            and return it to its owners.</p>
                        <p>Despite the general assurances of the Japanese Government that it will
                            respect American interests in China and desires such questions to be
                            settled on the spot, local attempts to deal with this case have
                            apparently made no progress. Early communications from this office to
                            the Japanese Consul General received unsatisfactory replies while recent
                            letters have remained unanswered. The Mission has also tried to settle
                            the case by direct negotiation with the Japanese military authorities at
                            Shanghai but has received no definite promise regarding evacuation and
                            desires that this Consulate General continue to do all in its power. It
                            is felt that further representations to the Japanese Consul General at
                            Shanghai will serve no good purpose and the instructions of the
                            Department are respectfully requested.</p>

                        <p>China National Aviation Corporation has informed this office of the
                            indefinite suspension of its airplane services from Hong Kong. This
                            leaves us without direct air service to Chungking. Eurasia Aviation
                            Company planes are still carrying their service from Hong Kong to Hankow
                            but there is no assurance of the continuation of this service or of air
                            connection from Hankow to Chungking. There is fear in local circles that
                            it may suspend all civil aviation service from Hong Kong to points in
                            China unless the Japanese will guarantee freedom from attack. My
                            Japanese colleague says that Eurasia Aviation Company and British
                            Imperial Airways have registered exact schedules with the Japanese
                            authorities and need not fear molestation. He has suggested that I
                            invite Pan American Airways to do the same on behalf of China National
                            Aviation Corporation but I am doing nothing of the kind pending
                            instructions. American pilot Wood says that he would now on account of

                            the Department, August 26, 1938, <ref target="frus1931-41v01#pg_619"><hi

                            provisional report received by the Foreign Office from the naval
                            authorities. This report states that in the absence of any established
                            law governing aviation the Japanese Air Forces since the commencement of
                            the China incident have been operated generally in accord with the draft
                            convention submitted to the International Conference at The Hague in
                            1923, articles 33 and 34 of the draft convention<note n="72"

                            explicitly providing, the report states, that commercial planes entering
                            a zone of hostilities are liable to attack. The report points out the
                            difficulty of distinguishing civil from military planes which may be
                            reconnoitering in the guise of passenger planes and which therefore
                            cannot claim immunity on that ground.</p>
                        <p>With specific regard to the incident under reference, the Japanese naval
                            report states that on account of the “suspicious behavior” of the
                            Chinese plane the Japanese planes pursued. They hold the Chinese plane
                            responsible for the incident and allege that no distinguishing marks
                            were visible. The report says that the Canton-Hankow Railway is being
                            attacked daily and that this fact alone should have caused the Chinese
                            plane to know that it is flying in a zone of military operations. The
                            report implies that the commercial plane was not forced down but landed
                            in the river and that the Japanese pursuit plane “left without
                            firing.”</p>
                        <p>The Vice Minister acknowledged the wide discrepancy between the Japanese
                            naval report and the report of pilot Wood and said that further
                            investigation would be made and a reply to our note delivered as soon as
                            possible. I replied that there seemed to me to be no doubt whatsoever
                            but that the concrete evidence would disprove the Japanese naval report.
                            I emphasized several times in our talk the <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456"

                        <p>830. According to Foreign Office official, Ambassador Craigie was
                            instructed last night to consult with Ambassador Grew and the French
                            Ambassador as to the advisability of approaching the Japanese Government
                            for a definition of its intentions in regard to foreign civilian
                            aircraft in China. If the Japanese Government attempts to stand by a
                            statement alleged to have been made by the Government spokesman at
                            Shanghai on Thursday, regarding the zone of military operations as
                            affecting the flight of civilian aircraft over China, the British
                            apparently intend to inform the Japanese that they will not admit any
                            such arbitrary extension of the zone of military operations to cover the
                            entire flying radius of foreign aircraft.</p>
                        <p>The American protest against the attack on August 24 on a commercial
                            plane by the Japanese was widely featured in today’s papers.</p>

                            missionaries to interior, the Japanese Consulate General has now given

                            cooperation of Japanese Consul General the railway will give special
                            facilities for transportation. About 30 Americans will travel to
                            Tsinanfu and to points south on the Tientsin–Pukow Railway. They propose

                        <p>563. 1. My British colleague has been instructed to inquire whether the
                            Japanese Government authorized a statement given to the press on August
                            26 by the Japanese official spokesman at Shanghai to the effect that
                            noncombatant aircraft fly over the area of hostilities at their own risk
                            and that the Japanese would accept no responsibility for any damage that
                            might arise. Craigie’s instructions are that, if the spokesman made the
                            statement with the authority of the Japanese Government, Craigie should
                            make it clear that the British Government does not recognize the right
                            of the Japanese Government to interfere [with?], much less attack,
                            foreign aircraft operating in China with the consent of the Chinese
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>2. Craigie suggests that I may wish to take parallel action. Apart from
                            the American interest in the China National Aviation Corporation, the
                            operation of Pan-American Airways service from Manila to South China
                            would seem to make desirable an approach by me to the Foreign Office
                            similar to that which Craigie has been directed to make. Please
                            instruct.</p>

                        <p>240. Tsingtao’s August 29, 3 p.m., return of missionaries to interior. In
                            absence of comment by Consul at Tsingtao, Department assumes that he
                            perceives no objection to the return of the Americans in question to
                            their stations. If you concur, the Department suggests that you so
                            inform Sokobin and at the same time say that the Department assumes that
                            he will endeavor to discourage the return to the interior at this time

                                xml:id="d620fn76">Peiping–Suiyuan.</note> Line. Embassy’s attempts
                            to further the matter have been consistently unsuccessful and letters to
                            the Japanese Embassy have been acknowledged only orally.</p>
                        <p>2. According to an official of the South Manchuria Railway Company, that
                            company is now temporarily operating the Pingsui and other North China
                            rail lines but is not receiving revenue therefrom and will relinquish
                            its control when a North China transportation company is established as
                            a subsidiary of the projected North China Development Company. The
                            latter will reputedly come into being October 31 and shares in the
                            subsidiary will subsequently be subscribed by the North China
                            Development Company, the South Manchuria Railway Company and the
                            Provisional Government. It seems to us that there is only a remote
                            possibility, if any, of negotiating a settlement of the claim with that
                            organization when “and if” it came into being. We accordingly recommend
                            that the matter be taken up in Tokyo. Please instruct.</p>

                        <p>Your August 26, 3 p.m. During the course of the present conflict, this
                            Government has followed the procedure of giving notification to both the
                            Chinese and Japanese Governments of the movements of American commercial
                            vessels and aircraft in the area of hostilities. These notifications
                            have been given on the basis of courtesy and practical expediency
                            without waiving any legal right. Accordingly the Department perceives no
                            objection to your communicating to the Pan American Airways the
                            statement and the suggestion of your Japanese colleague. You should make
                            it clear, however, that any action which the Company acting in behalf of
                            the China National Aviation Corporation feels prompted to take must be
                            on its own responsibility.</p>

                                <p>The incident was caused by the China National Aviation
                                    Corporation plane which within the Japanese field of operation
                                    acted in such a manner as to invite suspicions of its being a
                                    Chinese military craft, as stated in the following report, and
                                    which was consequently pursued and attacked by our naval planes
                                    in the belief that it was an enemy plane. While it is to be
                                    regretted that this resulted in endangering the life of an
                                    American citizen who happened to be the pilot of the plane, as
                                    well as in the death and wounding of non-combatant passengers
                                    and crew, the Japanese Government hold the view that the action
                                    of their naval planes is not unwarranted in the light of the
                                    above-mentioned circumstance. It is also their opinion that the
                                    company to which the aircraft in question belonged, being a
                                    Chinese juridical person, the incident is not one which involves
                                    Japan directly with any third power. However, I desire to add
                                    that, because of the wide discrepancies between the pilot’s
                                    accounts of the incident as given in <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461"

                            <p>“Report: On the morning of the 24th instant, 5 Japanese naval
                                airplanes proceeding in the direction of the Canton–Hankow Railway,
                                unexpectedly sighted over Chiautao Island at 9:30 o’clock A.M. a
                                large type land plane bearing no distinguishable mark some 2,000
                                metres away to the north which was flying toward the west at an
                                altitude of about 2,000 metres, and attempted to approach the plane
                                for the purpose of identification.</p>
                            <p>The large plane in question, as soon as it discovered our naval
                                planes approaching it, abruptly turned in the northwesterly
                                direction and took to flight at full speed, hiding itself among the
                                clouds. The approaching movement of the naval planes was made for
                                the purpose of ascertaining the nature of the land plane. However,
                                seeing the plane flee from them, our air squadron concluded in the
                                light of their past experiences that it was an enemy plane which
                                came either to attack our warships or to make reconnaissance, and
                                accordingly took an offensive position by placing 2 planes above and
                                3 planes below the clouds.</p>
                            <p>Soon after, our planes lying in wait below the clouds, discovering
                                the supposedly enemy plane, pursued and attacked it. The plane
                                continued to flee by taking advantage of the scattered clouds, but
                                hard pressed by our squadron, finally landed in the river on the
                                south side of a delta which lies 16 kilometres to the west of
                                Hungmenchikow. From the time they first sighted the plane until the
                                moment it landed, our planes were situated directly behind it for
                                the most time, so that it was difficult to ascertain its character,
                                and our planes were throughout in the belief that the land plane was
                                an enemy craft. As soon as the latter landed, however, our plane
                                descended in order to inspect the spot. When they reached a point
                                above the land plane where they could better distinguish the type of
                                the plane, a doubt arose as to its exact type. Our planes therefore
                                immediately stopped their attack.</p>
                            <p>As stated above, there was some time, though very brief, after the
                                landing of the said plane until a doubt came to be entertained as to
                                its nature, and during that brief period there were some among our
                                crafts which continued the attack, but there was absolutely no more
                                shooting thereafter.</p>
                            <p>Our naval planes then dived to 20 metres above the water and
                                inspected the landed plane, whereupon the plane in question was
                                found to be an all-metal Douglas passenger plane, with no painted
                                mark except a Chinese character signifying ‘mail’ marked on the
                                upper face of its right wing and on the right side of its body. Our
                                planes left without firing.</p>
                            <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0466"/>
                            <p>Our planes saw on the landed plane the pilot and also a few
                                passengers near the entrance of the passenger compartment in the
                                rear, but they thought that as the spot was close to the bank of the
                                river these men would be able to swim to the shore.”</p>

                                    return this fall, the total number of Americans actually in
                                    residence in the Tsinan Consular District will be not less than
                                    80 percent of the total listed in 1937 before the closing of the
                                    Consulate at Tsinan, and perhaps will be just as great.”</p>

                        <p>The despatch mentions several requests from Americans for consular
                            protection at Tsinanfu, draws a similarity between the problem of
                            returning Americans to Tsinanfu and the problem at Nanking and the lower
                            Yangtze, and states that there are now 4,000 Japanese nationals
                            including 1900 women and children residing at Tsinanfu. (A Japanese
                            Domei despatch from Tsinanfu September 2 states Japanese residents there
                            exceed 6400.)</p>

                            Nanking problems because of the danger to travel and generally disturbed
                            conditions in Shantung but [apparent omission] that would be on the
                            assumption that the Department may wish to have Sokobin’s viewpoint

                        <p>1186. During August this office at the request of American citizens and
                            organizations applied to the Japanese authorities for passes to
                            restricted areas for 101 persons, of which 46 were received. Also during
                            August this office “chopped” 61 applications of American citizens or
                            organizations for permits from the Japanese authorities to remove cargo
                            and other property from Hongkew and Yangtzepoo. Many of these
                            applications were for August permits providing for the organization
                            concerned to remove its goods during the month in accordance with the
                            requirements of its business. It is believed that practically all of
                            these applications were granted as no notice of any rejection has come
                            to the attention of this Consulate General.</p>
                        <p>The above figures cover original applications. They do not include

                            as the Japanese military authorities have abolished or decreased many of
                            their garrisons in the interior in order to utilize as many <pb n="464"

                            parts of the interior and consequently the Japanese authorities consider
                            such areas dangerous and are not issuing passes for travel in them.</p>

                        <p>1. On September 1 we made inquiry of the Foreign Office with regard to
                            the reported statement on August 26 by the Japanese spokesman at
                            Shanghai. We were informed that following a similar inquiry by the
                            British Embassy the Japanese Government authorities at Shanghai had been
                            instructed to make a report to Tokyo and that a reply would be made to
                            us upon receipt of that report. The Foreign Office has now sent to us a
                            copy of the statement issued yesterday afternoon by the Foreign Office
                            Press Bureau and has requested that it be accepted as a reply to our
                            inquiry of September 1. The statement follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The recent incident involving a China National Aviation
                                    Corporation plane occurred on account of the fact that the plane
                                    abruptly changed its course and took to flight as soon as it
                                    found the presence of the Japanese naval aircrafts which could
                                    not but believe that that plane was an enemy plane and pursued
                                    and attacked it. However, in view of the recent incident and the
                                    necessity of making our attitude clear with regard to aircrafts
                                    of third powers and Chinese non-military planes in the zone of

                                    statement.</p>
                                <p>(1) The Japanese forces have no intention whatever of attacking
                                    any Chinese non-military plane as such, but they are not in a
                                    position to guarantee its safety when it comes into the zone of
                                    operations of the Japanese Air Forces.</p>
                                <p>We believe this is quite proper because of the reasons that, <list>

                                            positions. Moreover, they are not marked according to a

                                <p>(2) As to aircrafts of third powers, the Japanese forces will pay
                                    full attention for their safety so long as those aircrafts
                                    comply with the Japanese request particularly with regard to the

                        <p>2. The Foreign Office forwarded to us at the same time a copy of a
                            memorandum from the Navy Department and requested that the contents be
                            communicated to Pan American Airways. We have made no reply to this
                            request. The memorandum in translation follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>157. Penultimate paragraph of Shanghai’s 1186, September 3, 1 p.m. The
                            Japanese authorities apparently wish to convey the impression that the
                            danger to Americans in the areas in question arises from guerrillas, but
                            it is probable that the real reason for their refusal to issue passes to
                            such areas is their desire to be free to follow their usual practice of
                            air bombing towns or cities believed to harbor guerrillas. Several cases
                            of such bombings have recently been reported in the vicinity of Nanking,
                            particularly in the areas north of the Yangtze where one severe bombing
                            occurred in a town 12 miles north of Pukow. These bombings often result
                            in heavy civilian casualties but only little <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466"
                                facs="0470"/>loss amongst guerrillas who usually have departed
                            before the planes arrive. It is understood that the reported large
                            increase in the population of Nanking last month was due in part to the
                            influx of Chinese from neighboring areas where further bombings were
                            feared.</p>

                            occasions only, once for approximately 2 days, the other delay consuming
                            a few hours.</p>

                            Japanese merchant vessels on the Yangtze. The representative of an
                            American oil firm here has obtained for this office information showing
                            that during the past 10 days there have been brought to Nanking from
                            Shanghai by 3 Japanese merchant vessels several shipments of commercial
                            freight, including 4200 tins of kerosene, 1300 tins of gasoline and 1600
                            cases of candles. I am mailing to Shanghai a list giving names of
                            steamers, dates, number of cases and brands of goods. I am also reliably
                            informed that some 2,000 cases of cigarettes were brought by [<hi

                                n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0471"/>vessels. It is understood that
                            nearly all the above-mentioned goods were purchased by Japanese firms in
                            Shanghai for shipment to and sale by Japanese merchants here.</p>
                        <p>British representatives of the two principal British river shipping
                            firms, who have been investigating conditions here and at Wuhu during
                            recent weeks have now forwarded reports to their head offices in
                            Shanghai. One of them informs me that he has compiled itemized lists of
                            commercial shipments carried on trips of Japanese merchant vessels
                            between Shanghai, Nanking and Wuhu. He states that copies of his reports
                            and lists have been furnished the British Consul General at Shanghai
                            which will doubtless be willing to make the information available to the
                            American Consulate General there.</p>
                        <p>The British representative mentioned above believes that on trips up
                            river from Shanghai by Japanese merchant vessels to Nanking the Japanese
                            military have first call on space, any remaining being given to Japanese
                            firms for commercial freight. He states, however, that on down river
                            trips practically all cargo carried is commercial. In particular to
                            British he reports that these vessels load up at Wuhu with rice for
                            Shanghai; as rice now sells at Wuhu for between $3 and $4 local currency
                            per unit of 200 pounds and at Shanghai for around $16, the profit made
                            by Japanese firms engaged in the rice business is considerable.</p>
                        <p>It seems clear from the evidence which has been obtained by American and
                            British business men here that, despite official denial, Japanese
                            merchant vessels are in fact carrying commercial freight for Japanese
                            firms. This being the case, there seem to be no reasonable grounds for
                            Japanese objections to the operation of non-Japanese foreign merchant
                            vessels, including the Standard Oil ships, between Shanghai and Wuhu at
                            least. The Japanese pretext that navigation is dangerous due to floating
                            mines, et cetera, seems to be specious as this office has heard of no
                            Japanese merchant vessel being sunk or damaged on this stretch of the
                            river by such means during recent months.</p>
                        <p>Until the present unwarranted Japanese interference with American and
                            other foreign trade along the river ceases, and in particular until
                            there is freedom of commerce and navigation on the river, at least as
                            far as Wuhu, American business and other interests will continue to
                            suffer. As an example of losses now being sustained by American business
                            in this area, I am informed by the representative of an American oil
                            company here that under normal conditions there would be sold by the
                            foreign oil companies during the coming fall and winter season in the
                            Nanking, Wuhu and Chinkiang area a monthly average <pb n="468"
                                xml:id="pg_468" facs="0472"/>of approximately 200,000 units of
                            kerosene, valued at about $3,000,000 local currency. In addition, there
                            would be an average monthly business of about $1,000,000 local currency
                            in other petroleum products, such as gasoline, candles, lubricating and
                            diesel engine oil. It is understood that much more than a majority of
                            this business would be handled by American firms. However, under present
                            conditions they can do no business here and the only kerosene coming to
                            Nanking now is a small amount, stated to be not more than 6,000 cases
                            monthly, sold by foreign oil companies in Shanghai to Japanese firms for
                            shipment here.</p>
                        <p>The refusal of the Japanese to permit non-Japanese foreign commercial
                            navigation on the river and their refusal to carry non-Japanese
                            commercial freight on their own commercial vessels [is?] resulting in
                            constant difficulties to Americans engaged in legitimate business and
                            other activities in this area. For instance, if it were not for the
                            courtesy of the commanding officers of the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Oahu</hi> and the British gunboats, much needed medical supplies
                            for American missionary hospitals here and at Wuhu could not be
                            obtained. Further, this office has been endeavoring for months, without
                            success, to obtain space from the Japanese for the shipment to Shanghai
                            of motor cars belonging to the Ambassador, Counselor Peck and Captain
                                Roberts,<note n="81" xml:id="d630fn81">Capt. Frank N. Roberts,
                                former Assistant Military Attaché in China.</note> respectively, as
                            well as personal effects of Paxton<note n="82" xml:id="d630fn82">J. Hall
                                Paxton, Consul at Shanghai.</note> and Roberts. It would seem that,
                            if for no other reason than international courtesy, the Japanese could
                            find space for the effects belonging to members of the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>It seems evident that, unless foreign protests are effective, the
                            Japanese intend to place every obstacle in the way of non-Japanese
                            foreign trade along the Yangtze and to retain trade for themselves. It
                            also seems probable that, unless protests are effective, the Japanese
                            will continue to refuse to permit non-Japanese foreign commercial
                            navigation on the Yangtze and, possibly, will endeavor eventually to
                            establish a Japanese shipping monopoly on the river.</p>
                        <p>It is respectfully recommended that further representations be made to
                            the appropriate authorities at Shanghai and Tokyo, in an effort to bring
                            to an end the present unwarranted interference with legitimate
                            activities of American citizens and organizations in this area.</p>
                        <p>Sent to Shanghai. Shanghai please repeat to Tokyo.</p>

                                    presumptuous use of the call letters formerly employed by the

                                    a violation of the sovereign rights of China. The relations
                                    between the United States and China have always been intimate
                                    and the United States has, in the past, respected China’s

                            <item>The companies’ position is that the debiting of the Marconi Loan
                                installments on the balance sheets for December, January and
                                February was carried out at the request of the Chinese Telegraph
                                Administration after the divisional manager of the Eastern Extension
                                Telegraph Company had discussed the matter with the Japanese
                                consular officials and gained the impression that they would have no
                                objection. However, objection was later interposed by the companies
                                feeling it is extremely unfair to them to demand that this
                                transaction be reopened. <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0475"
                                />The cable companies take the position that they cannot comply with
                                the Japanese request and the Pacific Company inquires whether it can
                                rely upon the support of this Consulate General in upholding its
                                stand.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>As regards item 2, the companies feel that any compliance with
                                this request would mean their losing all hold on the funds hitherto
                                held in suspense, thus further embarrassing their position vis-à-vis
                                the Chinese Telegraph Administration, who claim ownership of the
                                monies impounded. The companies consider that the monies should
                                remain in the present special suspended account until the situation
                                [is] finally cleared up. The companies inquire whether they shall
                                endeavor to maintain this stand and if so what support the various
                                diplomatic and consular officers could extend them. As regards item
                                3, the companies’ stand on this request will be governed by the
                                answer to item 2. As regards items 4 and 5, the companies perceive
                                no objection to compliance.</item>

                                both state that they are awaiting replies from respective
                                governments in connection with developments described in my 1116,
                                August 16, 4 p.m. They do not feel position to express any views on

                                demands. The Danish Minister also desires to await the return to

                                    view of this and of the fact that the godown in question had
                                    been occupied by the Chinese troops since August, 1937, it is
                                    established that the said hogsheads of tobacco had been
                                    appropriated by the Chinese troops before they were put to
                                    military use. Upon appropriation by the enemy the goods ceased
                                    to be neutral private property and became public property of the

                        <p>316. Your 568, August 31, 9 p.m., and previous. You are authorized to
                            present a reply to the Foreign Office’s note along lines as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The American Government has given careful consideration to the
                                    statements contained in the Foreign Office’s note and annex of
                                    August 31 in regard to the attack by Japanese naval planes upon
                                    a commercial airplane of the China National Aviation
                                    Corporation, and to pertinent reports from American official
                                    sources in regard to the principal circumstances of the attack
                                    in question.</p>
                                <p>The American Government has ascertained that the plane which was
                                    the object of attack was operated in a well-known and
                                    well-established service between Hong Kong and Chungking; that
                                    the attack upon this plane occurred during a flight which was
                                    carried out as to date and time on a regularly advertised
                                    schedule out of Hong Kong; and that when the Japanese planes
                                    sighted the civilian plane, the civilian plane was on the
                                    regularly-flown course. It has also been learned that the plane
                                    attacked bore identification marks on the upper and lower
                                    surfaces of its wings in the form of Chinese characters 5 by 4½
                                    feet in size made with strokes over 5 inches wide. As the
                                    foregoing information is of a public character and was available
                                    to the Japanese authorities, the American Government is of the
                                    opinion that the exercise of reasonable care to identify the
                                    object of attack would have averted the incident in
                                    question.</p>
                                <p>With regard to the opinion expressed by the Japanese Government
                                    that the incident does not involve the interests of third
                                    powers, it was pointed out in the Embassy’s note of August 26 to

                                    was directly imperiled and that loss was occasioned to American
                                    interests vested in the China National Aviation Corporation. It
                                    is obvious that the incident in question was and is of material
                                    concern to the American Government and people; and, moreover,
                                    this Government reserves the right to call to the attention of
                                    the Japanese Government any and all instances of the imperiling
                                    of American lives or interests in China by the activities of

                                    government’s repeated assurances with regard to the rights and

                                p.m.<note n="90" xml:id="d636fn90">Latter not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>1. Please inform the Japanese Government that the contents of the
                            memorandum from the Japanese Navy Department have been communicated to
                            the Pan American Airways System; and that the company states that,
                            animated by a desire to avoid any unfortunate incident which might
                            imperil its airplane passengers and crew, it will make every effort to
                            conform to the suggestions contained in the Japanese Navy Department’s
                            memorandum with regard to the route to be flown between Macao and Hong
                            Kong but has indicated that weather conditions at times may make it
                            doubtful whether its planes could be sure of following the suggested
                            route in and out of Macao. Please add that this Government does not
                            recognize any right of the Japanese Government, or of any agency
                            thereof, to interfere with, much less attack, American aircraft
                            operating in or over non-Japanese territory. You should also state that,
                            irrespective of whether airplanes of American nationality comply with
                            any request or suggestion of the Japanese Government in reference to
                            flights over any particular area of Chinese territory or Chinese waters,
                            the Government of the United States definitely expects the Japanese
                            Government to take all necessary measures to prevent any action by
                            Japanese armed forces which might endanger American plans or their
                            occupants.</p>
                        <p>2. The Department desires that when you present to the Japanese Foreign
                            Office a reply in the sense outlined in the preceding paragraph you at
                            the same time present the reply to the Foreign Office’s note of August
                            31 in regard to the attack upon the China National Aviation
                            Corporation’s commercial plane (see Department’s telegram No. 316, Sept.
                            14, 2 p.m.). The Department suggests that in presenting these replies
                            you make oral comment, either as on your own initiative or as under
                            instruction, along lines as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    calls for prompt and effective remedial action on the part of
                                    the Japanese Government.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Drumright called on Dr. S. S. Liu at the Foreign Office today and
                            discussed the radio situation at Shanghai, particularly with <pb n="476"
                                xml:id="pg_476" facs="0480"/>reference to the numerous protests of
                            the Foreign Office in regard to the arrangements entered into by Mackay
                            Radio and Telegraph Company and R. C. A. Communications, Inc., with the
                            Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Drumright referred to various notes received from the Foreign Office
                            on this subject, including the note dated September 10, 1938, and stated
                            that the substance of these notes had been or were being communicated to
                            the Department of State, the Consulate General at Shanghai, and the
                            American radio companies in question. Mr. Drum-right briefly reviewed
                            the events leading up to the present situation at Shanghai, including
                            the withdrawal of Chinese troops and authorities from the Shanghai area,
                            the action of the Japanese in seeking a measure of control over the
                            radio communications service at Shanghai by virtue of their military
                            occupation of the area, and the difficult situation in which the foreign
                            radio companies would have found themselves faced should they have
                            failed to take Japanese desires into consideration. Consequently, in
                            order to preserve their interests and property and to maintain a
                            constant radio service with the outside world, a matter of vital
                            interest to people in China and abroad alike, the foreign radio
                            companies, after much consideration and consultation, had decided upon
                            their own responsibility to continue the radio service at Shanghai. They
                            had, according to information available, arrived at a temporary <hi
                                rend="italic">de facto</hi> arrangement with the Japanese in order
                            to meet the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> situation existing at
                            Shanghai. It was difficult to perceive how the foreign radio companies
                            at Shanghai could have pursued any other course, for to have refused to
                            cooperate with the Japanese as the military masters of the Shanghai area
                            would have resulted in difficulties and possible loss of investments,
                            not to mention disruption of essential radio service.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Drumright hoped that Dr. Liu would bring the realities of the radio
                            situation at Shanghai, as outlined above, to the attention of the
                            Ministry of Communications and other competent organs, with a view to
                            closing the case.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Liu replied that he would, of course, bring the above-mentioned views
                            to the attention of the Ministry of Communications, but expressed regret
                            that the American authorities seemed unwilling to cause the American
                            radio companies to sever communications with the Japanese. He considered
                            the activities of the American radio companies to constitute a breach of
                            China’s sovereignty and to be inimical to the traditional friendship
                            existing between the United States and China. He requested that these
                            views be brought to the attention of the Ambassador and the Department
                            of State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Drumright replied that the views of the Chinese Government, as
                            outlined by Dr. Liu, would be brought to the attention of the competent
                            American authorities. He stated that it was, as Dr. Liu was <pb n="477"
                                xml:id="pg_477" facs="0481"/>aware, the desire of the American
                            Government to respect the sovereignty of China but that it appeared that
                            the preservation of Chinese territory and sovereignty seemed to rest
                            with the Chinese. The present situation had arisen out of the occupation
                            of Shanghai by the Japanese who exercised <hi rend="italic">de
                                facto</hi> control there. In order to prevent disruption of the
                            normal processes of life, it seemed necessary to recognize the
                            actualities of the situation and to be governed accordingly.</p>
                        <p>In concluding the discussion, Dr. Liu, in response to a question from Mr.
                            Drumright, stated that to his knowledge only one foreign radio company—a
                            Netherlands organization—had severed radio communications with Shanghai.
                            When questioned whether similar protests had been lodged concerning the
                            use by the Japanese of the railways in which there were foreign
                            interests, Dr. Liu stated that he was not aware that protests had been
                            made in connection therewith. He stated it to be his opinion, however,
                            that the cases of the radio companies and the railways were not
                            analogous.</p>

                        <p>1244. My 1218, September 13, 5 p.m. British Ambassador has instructed
                            British Consul General to inquire of his Japanese colleague whether the
                            demands of the Special Service Section of the Japanese Army represent
                            the policy of and have the support of the Japanese Government and if so
                            to request that they be put forward through the usual official channels.
                            The Danish Minister informs me that under the instructions received from
                            his Government he is authorized to proceed along the same lines. I
                            respectfully suggest that I also be authorized to make a similar inquiry

                        <p>It was the opinion of the German military advisers, when they left Hankow
                            at the beginning of July, that the Chinese should be able to hold the
                            city until the 1st of October. It now looks as if the Chinese will do
                            better than that, but though opinions differ as to the probable date of
                            Hankow’s fall there is general agreement that the Japanese must and will
                            take Hankow, as long as China resists.</p>
                        <p>2. When Hankow does fall, will the occupation be a repetition of what
                            happened at Nanking or a peaceful turnover as at Tsingtao? The answer
                            lies primarily with the Japanese and Chinese but the determining factor
                            may be the attitude of the foreign powers, especially the United States.
                            It is widely accepted in China that what occurred at Nanking and many
                            other places taken by the Japanese is only the usual Japanese way of
                            treating captured towns and that the brutalities which have so shocked
                            foreigners are not the result <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0483"
                            />of lax discipline but that license to loot, rape and kill is the
                            normal reward, in this war at all events, of successful Japanese troops,
                            as it has been in the past in other armies. Many observers expect the
                            Japanese to behave no better at Hankow than they did at Nanking, unless
                            some restraint can be put upon them, and that the more stubbornly the
                            Chinese resist and the longer they delay Hankow’s capture the worse the
                            Japanese will behave when they finally reach it.</p>
                        <p>3. At one time it was planned that the Chinese troops as they retired
                            before the Japanese would not pass through but would be diverted around
                            Hankow, where meanwhile the local garrison, commanded by a Hupeh general
                            liked and trusted by the foreign community, would maintain order as long
                            as possible and withdraw before the Japanese arrived. Before I left
                            there were signs that this plan might be discarded in favor of one that
                            boded ill for Hankow: the Communists were said to be pressing for a
                            strong stand at Hankow, the new Hupeh Governor (replacing the general
                            mentioned above) was talking of arming the civil population, and there
                            were hints that the “scorched earth” policy, which has strong advocates
                            in the Chinese high command and which might, for example, involve the
                            wrecking of the Japanese Concession, might be applied at Hankow.
                            Foreigners, while hoping for the best were preparing for the worst,
                            which they envisaged as a combined Japanese attack by air, land and
                            river, overwhelming Chinese resistance and filling the city with fleeing
                            Chinese troops with the Japanese in hot pursuit and bloody encounters in
                            the streets and on the Bund. If, however, the Japanese prefer to take
                            Hankow by enveloping it rather than by direct assault, the Chinese may
                            make a timely withdrawal, as they did at Hsuchow, and the occupation may
                            meet no organized resistance.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>17. At Nanking under appallingly difficult circumstances and without
                            official support, and at many towns in the interior, small groups of
                            devoted missionaries, cut off from contact with the outside world, have
                            been able to safeguard much of their missions’ property, to save
                            thousands of innocent Chinese from violence and death, and to exert a
                            restraining influence on the occupation. At Hankow, with its French
                            Concession, its partly British-administered S. A. D. 3, its large
                            foreign interests and extensive foreign properties, its foreign
                            consulates, and its foreign warships, conditions are not less favorable
                            for the maintenance of foreign rights, the protection of foreign
                            interests, the curbing of barbarism, and the performance of a great
                            humanitarian work.</p>
                        <p>18. I venture to hope that the American Government will (1) make strong
                            representations to the Japanese and Chinese Governments (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) for the protection of our citizens, property
                            and interests at Hankow <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0484"/>and
                                (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) for the establishment and observance of
                            the safety zones proposed by the Committee; (2) remind Tokyo of her
                            repeated promises to respect our rights and her frequent disclaimers of
                            animus against the Chinese people and warn her that we regard Hankow as
                            a test of her good faith in both respects; and (3) see that our efforts,
                            and what happens at Hankow, receive full publicity.</p>
                        <p>19. A firm stand in assertion of our rights and the rights of
                            non-combatants should do good not only at Hankow but wherever in the Far
                            East those rights may be threatened; it should also strengthen the hands
                            of France and Great Britain in Europe. The risks are no greater than
                            those incurred by weakness.</p>

                            <item>Department is correct in assuming that balances already deposited
                                in suspense account by cable companies consist entirely of money

                                no interest in the Marconi Loan and item 1 of the Japanese demands
                                does not concern us and should be disregarded. The three cable
                                companies here prepare joint balance sheets and deposit the balances
                                due the Chinese Government in a joint suspense account; the three
                                companies are usually addressed jointly by the Japanese authorities
                                and usually reply jointly; the three companies also usually send
                                identic letters to their consular representatives. This accounts for
                                the inclusion of item 1 in the letter to us. As to item 4, following

                            reply to the Japanese Consul General along lines as follows: <quote

                                <p>The ownership of the hogsheads of tobacco by the Carolina Leaf
                                    Tobacco Company, an American firm; the presence of those
                                    hogsheads of tobacco in the godowns of the Joint Savings Society
                                    at the time of the occupation of those godowns by the Japanese
                                    forces on or about October 31, 1937; and the seizure of the
                                    hogsheads of tobacco by the Japanese military authorities are
                                    established facts which appear to be accepted by the Japanese
                                    Consul General. The Consul General contends, however, that the
                                    hogsheads were “booty” and seized as such, and he alleges, as a
                                    basis for his contention, that the Chinese troops appropriated
                                    the tobacco which act gave to the tobacco an “enemy” character
                                    and consequently made it subject to confiscation by the Japanese
                                    forces under “the rules of war”. The Japanese authorities
                                    affirm, therefore, that they are not in position to return the
                                    tobacco or to accept any claim for damages.</p>
                                <p>In the opinion of the American Government there exists no factual
                                    or legal basis for the Japanese contention. The fact that
                                    Chinese troops had made use of the godowns affords no grounds
                                    whatsoever for the Japanese contention that the Chinese troops
                                    appropriated the tobacco. Use which the Chinese troops may have
                                    made of the hogsheads was simply of an incidental character.
                                    This was no more appropriation than would be a similar use of a
                                    building or a wall or a mound of earth. The tobacco, belonging
                                    to an American firm, could, as a matter of fact, not legally
                                    have been appropriated by the Chinese troops; nor subsequently
                                    could it legally be appropriated by the Japanese troops.</p>
                                <p>The American Government maintains that the tobacco in question
                                    could not lawfully be taken and be damaged or destroyed or
                                    appropriated by either the Chinese or the Japanese
                                    authorities—or by any other authorities—and that such procedure
                                    without compensation would be or is confiscation. Under no rules
                                    of war would that be legal. Even if the Japanese authorities
                                    were in position to appeal with warrant to those rules, such
                                    appeal would not support the Japanese contention in this matter.
                                    There is nothing in the rules of war which authorizes or makes
                                    lawful any confiscation of noncontraband property of nationals
                                    of third countries.</p>
                                <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0488"/>
                                <p>The American Government, therefore, asks the Japanese authorities
                                    to reconsider this matter and urges that measures promptly be
                                    taken either to effect return of the tobacco to the American
                                    owner or fully to indemnify the owner.</p>

                        <p>1273. 1. I have received a letter from the Japanese Consulate General the
                            gist of which follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>On September 17 the Japanese naval landing forces found at Wusueh
                                    a hulk marked with an American flag and the inscription “W. H.
                                    and Co.”</p>
                                <p>It was found that no hulk of American nationality was at Wusueh
                                    prior to the outbreak of hostilities and documents belonging to
                                    the hulk give reason to believe that it is the property of the
                                    China Merchants’ Steam Navigation Company, formerly at
                                    Kiukiang.</p>
                                <p>Therefore the “hulk is to be regarded as Chinese property
                                    camouflaged as foreign property, and it will be disposed of as
                                    such by the Japanese naval authorities, together with articles
                                    found in the <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0489"/>hulk”. A
                                    detailed list of these articles is given, including two
                                    automobiles, one truck and other miscellaneous cargo of lesser
                                    value.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>2. I have replied as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I have the honor to refer to your letter of September 26, 1938,
                                    regarding the discovery by the Japanese naval landing forces at
                                    Wusueh on September 17 of a hulk, marked with an American flag,
                                    together with certain articles found therein. As Wusueh is not
                                    in the Shanghai Consular District, I am referring the matter to
                                    the appropriate American authorities for investigation.
                                    Meanwhile, I must reserve all rights in connection with any of
                                    this property which may be American owned.”</p>

                            Government telegraph offices have deliberately disregarded “via”
                            indications inserted by senders who wished to use the Commercial Pacific
                            Cable route, contrary to assurances given by the <pb n="486"

                                    reports. And those marks on the foreign properties, already
                                    installed but which have been deteriorated or their clear
                                    visibility is marred due to their constant exposure to elements,
                                    are requested to be replaced with the new ones. It is further
                                    requested that the good offices of the foreign Embassies and
                                    Legations will be pleased to give all the effectual efforts for
                                    keeping the resisting Chinese forces and their military
                                    establishments away from the properties of the nationals of
                                    their countries while the Japanese forces are engaged in
                                    offensives and especially while the shelling and bombing are
                                    conducted. The Japanese forces in fact even dared to undergo the
                                    strategic inconveniences and suffer disadvantages in their
                                    operations in order that they might accord the full respect for
                                    and protection of the life and property of the third power
                                    nationals in China.</p>

                                    earnestly requested for rendering their cooperation with the
                                    sincere efforts of the Japanese military authorities giving a

                                which it is estimated will in most cases run for about 5 years. The

                        <p>British official and mercantile circles in Hong Kong are reported in
                            Canton to believe that an invasion of South China is imminent. The
                            Chinese authorities express confidence in their ability to defend South
                            China. It is reported that Kwangtung recently sent 2 divisions of troops
                            to the front but that 3 more divisions which were intended for the front
                            are being held here for the present.</p>
                        <p>With reference to my June 15, 4 p.m., I would repeat that if a land
                            invasion should occur a general evacuation of Americans should be urged
                            at once and it is believed that most of the women and children would
                            leave voluntarily; many of the missionaries especially the priests and
                            best of the doctors would however insist upon remaining unless the
                            invading forces came to their immediate vicinity; that the invasion
                            would place those Americans in outlying portions of this district in
                            little more danger than they are at present.</p>
                        <p>The situation is being closely watched and all Americans will be urged to
                            leave if an invasion begins.</p>
                        <p>More than 75 Japanese planes yesterday raided Kwangtung and Kwangsi, many
                            bombs were dropped on the 2 railways and the Canton-Hankow Railway was
                            temporarily out of commission but train will run tonight.</p>

                            Tsingtao including Americans, but that the police authorities are not

                        <p>The Embassy is of the opinion that the form calls for no data of a real
                            confidential nature and that it might prove helpful to Americans in
                            Tsingtao to have the police authorities know the addresses of the

                                request proper recognition of the legitimate American interests

                            <item>It is noted, however, that (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the
                                corporation was formed (principally for the purpose of rebuilding
                                and re-equipping Chinese factories and for their operation under
                                lease) after the beginning of the current hostilities in China with
                                full knowledge of the risks involved and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                                while the alleged American financial interest in the corporation
                                constitutes a majority of the stated paid-in capital, it represents
                                only a small percentage of the total authorized capital. The 75
                                percent not yet paid in might possibly be taken up by aliens with
                                resulting control by them. With these considerations in mind the
                                Department is of the opinion that, if you should feel warranted in
                                taking any action, your action should be within the limits indicated
                                in the first paragraph of this telegram and should not include
                                intervention in the event that the Japanese oppose the corporation’s
                                activities as described.</item>

                            resultant frequent inquiries made of the Department by the press and

                                    the opinion that there may be a real military consideration
                                    involved in the refusal of the Japanese to permit the shipment
                                    of the gasoline in question. Under the circumstances, and
                                    without any implication that the Japanese can properly interfere
                                    with the movement of American merchandise, the Department is of
                                    the opinion that no useful purpose would be served by making a
                                    specific approach to the Japanese Foreign Office in regard to
                                    this matter. The Department suggests, however, that in your
                                    discretion you bring the case to the attention of the Japanese
                                    Foreign Office in connection with other cases of interference

                            received a telegram from his Foreign Office stating that the Portuguese
                            Government had received at Tokyo a communication from the Japanese

                            whether I could give him an indication of our views.</p>
                        <p>I said that the note which had been presented to our Embassy in Tokyo
                            conformed to the general outline of the communication received by the
                            Portuguese Government, as described by him. I said that at the end of
                            the note received by us there was an indication that we might expect to
                            receive a further communication particularizing <pb n="496"

                            Embassy at Tokyo the text of an additional note which the Japanese
                            Foreign Office had sent to our Embassy<note n="12" xml:id="d669fn12">See

                            had received a number of such communications from the Japanese
                            Government and that we had several times informed the Japanese
                            Government of our general position, namely, that although American
                            nationals were under no obligation to take precautionary measures,
                            American officials had consistently advised such nationals to take
                            precautionary measures; that many Americans had withdrawn from dangerous
                            areas; that American nationals had placed identifying marks on their
                            properties; that the location of the properties had been communicated to
                            the Japanese; but that whether or not American nationals took such
                            precautionary measures, this Government would be obliged, in case there
                            occurred injury or damage to American nationals or their property
                            resulting from Japanese military operations, to hold the Japanese
                            Government responsible therefor. I told the Minister that after we had
                            given consideration to the two notes which we had received in Tokyo from
                            the Japanese Government, I would expect to inform him of our views in
                            regard thereto.</p>

                                <p>Heavy fighting is expected in the near future in a zone within

                                    within a radius of about 100 kilometers around Swatow. According

                        <p>There are now 79 American-born Chinese, whose registrations have been
                            approved by the Department, in Canton and vicinity, and while efforts
                            will be continued to get them to evacuate soon, this is especially
                            difficult since there are at present no egress to Hong Kong either by
                            the Canton–Hong Kong Railway or by the river.</p>
                        <p>It is felt that this Consulate General should be able to assemble at the
                            Consulate General these persons as well as the white Americans if the
                            Japanese come to Canton or start to shell or bomb the city. However, the
                            British Consul General says that the regulations of the British
                            Concession forbid any persons of the Chinese race except servants to
                            reside on Shameen and that if an emergency comes no Chinese will be
                            allowed to come on the island.</p>
                        <p>I have been told that naturally we do not want to have these people come
                            to live on Shameen but that if attack comes it might be necessary to
                            keep them here for a short time until means could be found to take them
                            out. His reply is that this would not be permitted. I would ask for your
                            consideration of this situation and possible approach to the British
                            Ambassador or Government and for instructions in the <pb n="498"

                            the furnishing of maps to the Japanese and the dates of bombing but
                            omitting mention of individual protests. You should point out that the

                            does not include the many other instances of the bombing of American

                            that in 25 of the 29 cases listed the Japanese authorities had been
                            furnished—in some instances only a few days before the bombing
                            occurred—with maps or other information describing the exact location of

                            Government to the end that the Japanese armed forces in China may
                            exercise scrupulous care to avoid injury to American lives and property,
                            and earnestly request that such steps be taken.</p>

                        <p>Hostilities in South China have caused Eurasia Company partially to
                            suspend its air services to and from Hong Kong which since recent
                            resumption have been operated more or less regularly at night. Service
                            henceforth will be irregular. On the basis of the Department’s telegram
                            of August 30, 7 p.m. and related correspondence, operations manager W.
                            L. Bond of China National Aviation Corporation, with the assistance of
                            this Office, approached the local Japanese Consul General with a view to
                            a resumption of the China National Services. Japanese Consul General has
                            stated in effect that his Government cannot guarantee safety of planes
                            in a war zone and that as South China now has that status neither
                            Eurasia nor China National could be given guarantees. He offered to
                            refer the matter to Tokyo, but Mr. Bond has not indicated whether he
                            wishes that done as Tokyo reply will doubtless confirm what Japanese
                            Consul General has already said. Bond has now gone to Chungking in one
                            of his planes which took off at night and we assume he does not consider
                            it advisable to attempt resumption of regular service.</p>

                        <p>170. American Presbyterian Mission in Nanking reported today that it had
                            received a report from Chinese members of the mission at Tungtsing,
                            Kiangsu, on the motor road from Nanking to Wuhu, stating that on the
                            afternoon of October 15 more than 10 Japanese soldiers under the command
                            of an officer drove up to the mission property in a truck, tore down the
                            American flag flying over the chapel and burned it, then drove away in
                            the direction of Nanking.</p>
                        <p>On August 31 this office took up with the Japanese Consulate General here
                            a case of unauthorized entry into this property by Japanese soldiers and
                            on September 7 that office informed us in writing that “the military
                            police reported to me that a notice has been affixed in Japanese to make
                            the protection of the property doubly sure.” This notice was shown to
                            the Japanese soldiers by the mission members on October 15 but the
                            soldiers disregarded it, stating that the Japanese flag should be
                            flown.</p>
                        <p>I addressed a note today to the Japanese Consul General here,
                            communicating the report of the mission, requesting that a prompt
                            investigation be made and asking that this office be informed of the
                            resume [<hi rend="italic">result</hi>] thereof. I stated that, if the
                            investigation should confirm the report of the mission, I felt sure that
                            the Japanese authorities would wish to offer an expression of regret
                            over the desecration of the American flag.</p>
                        <p>There are no Americans on the property at Tungtsing but the mission here
                            has complete confidence in the integrity of the Chinese members who
                            reported the incident. The Japanese military, however, refused to accept
                            the word of a reputable American citizen in the case of Dr. Thomson some
                            months ago and there seems but little chance that they will accept the
                            word of Chinese in the present case. I consider nevertheless that the
                            matter should be pressed.</p>

                            American Ambassador to Japan, in response to two communications,
                            reiterated to the Japanese Foreign Office the previously expressed
                            attitude of the American Government that though American nationals have
                            been and are being advised to take certain measures for their safety and
                            for the protection of their property, and that so far as practicable and
                            reasonable such nationals are doing so, nevertheless obligation to avoid
                            injury to American lives and property rests upon the Japanese military
                            authorities irrespective of whether American nationals do or do not take
                            such precautionary measures; and that the American Ambassador added that
                            the American Government expects scrupulous observance of the assurance
                            given by the Japanese Government that it intends to respect foreign
                            interests and to make the “best of efforts” to prevent any damage to
                            them.</p>

                        <p>Department’s October 18, noon. The route via Shekki and Macao still
                            appears quite safe. Numbers of people are going to Hong Kong from Canton
                            and some coming here from Hong Kong via this route. The Chinese
                            authorities have given me a note of instructions to the magistrate of
                            Shekki to expedite the passage of Americans from Shekki to Macao by bus
                            and these instructions will accompany groups of Americans I send to
                            Shekki. I shall also notify Japanese authorities of every such movement
                            through the Japanese Consul General at Hong Kong.</p>
                        <p>As suggested in my October 18, 4 p.m.,<note n="19" xml:id="d679fn19">Not
                                printed.</note> it would be of great help if an American official
                            could work at Macao to see that transportation is provided for such
                            groups of Americans arriving at Shekki. I have asked Ambassador to allot
                            to this office $500 under authorization 62, 1939, to cover expenses of
                            launch which I now have at Shameen.</p>
                        <p>In case of approach of Japanese to vicinity of Canton, arrangements have
                            been made for those Americans who are willing to do so to come to the
                            Consulate General and the loan has been arranged of the Standard Vacuum
                            building next to this property for use as barracks for those who could
                            not be taken care of on Consulate premises.</p>
                        <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0507"/>
                        <p>Certain groups of Americans state they do not intend to come to Shameen.
                            The American faculty of Lingnan University, which has now been given
                            back to the American Foundation by the Chinese University, say they
                            intend to remain at Lingnan.</p>
                        <p>At the request of an American-British volunteer committee I yesterday
                            forwarded the Japanese Consul General at Hong Kong the committee’s
                            request that in the event of Japanese occupation of Canton, Lingnan,
                            Pakhoktung, Holy Trinity School, Hackett Memorial Hospital and Canton
                            Hospital be placed out of bounds for Japanese soldiers if the Chinese
                            would give similar undertaking; the first 3 to be used as refugee areas
                            for noncombatants and the latter 2 as medical refuges. No reply has been
                            received as yet, I have also separately notified the Japanese
                            authorities that Lingnan has been taken back by the American
                            Foundation.</p>
                        <p>Some of the Presbyterian missionaries say they intend to stay as long as
                            possible at Pakhoktung and a number of American doctors will remain at
                            their hospital as long as possible. Every endeavor, however, will be
                            made to induce these groups to concentrate on Shameen in case of
                            necessity.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Mindanao</hi> is of course remaining at Canton and
                            the commander of the South China Patrol<note n="20" xml:id="d679fn20"
                                >Capt. John T. G. Stapler, U. S. N.</note> and I are working
                            together on this matter. Final steps to be taken will of course depend
                            upon the course of events but it is believed eventualities have been
                            considered and provided for as far as they can now be visualized.</p>

                        <p>271. Canton’s October 18, 4 p.m.<note n="21" xml:id="d680fn21">Not
                                printed.</note> With reference to the arrangements which Canton
                            states have been made for the placing of a naval sentry at the gate of
                            Hackett Memorial Hospital, the Department questions the advisability of
                            the plan. Although in emergencies naval personnel has fulfilled the
                            function, when circumstances render it feasible, of assisting in the
                            evacuation of Americans to points of concentration, the stationing of a
                            sentry at an outlying point as in this instance would seem to be
                            contrary to general practice. In our opinion the presence of a sentry at
                            Hackett would not in the contingency mentioned by Canton ensure the
                            immunity of the hospital and its occupants but would rather create a
                            risk of involvement of our Navy <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0508"
                            />with the combatants and would thereby tend to complicate the task of
                            affording appropriate protection to American citizens in general.</p>
                        <p>If in the light of the foregoing you or the Consulate General at Canton
                            feel there are circumstances which render the carrying out of the plan
                            desirable, please telegraph your views in order that the Department may
                            give the matter further consideration.</p>
                        <p>Please instruct Canton in accordance with the foregoing.</p>

                        <p>Majority of information from our various and most reliable contacts in
                            Hong Kong, excepting Chinese, indicates continued progress of Japanese
                            in direction of Canton, including a movement flanking Chinese defences
                            in order to reach that city also from the north. Lungmun, north of
                            Tsengcheng, variously reported to be in Japanese hands. Japanese advance
                            now appears to be within 25 miles of Canton. Reliably reported here that
                            American hospital and church at Waichow unmolested and safe. I have been
                            in touch with Shekki and have no information of congestion of American
                            refugees there as indicated by Linnell but am at once sending

                            Smith.</p>
                        <p>1. Japanese Consul General has replied to my previous communications on
                            the subject in a letter the gist of which follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Reservation of rights of the American company for compensation
                                    for losses suffered in the original shipment at the present time
                                    is “regrettable”, as there is no evidence of Japanese
                                    responsibility for those losses. Furthermore, as no concrete
                                    evidence of the American company’s ownership of the wood oil,
                                    such as a bill of lading or consular invoice, has been
                                    presented, and as the wood oil was contained in baskets and
                                    transported in junks, an unlikely method of shipping for an
                                    American firm, the Japanese naval authorities at first were
                                    reluctant to permit the cargo as American owned. However, later,
                                    for the sake of amity between Japan and the United States, they
                                    “set <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0510"/>aside” this
                                    question and made the offer of settlement by paying for the
                                    remaining amount of wood oil. It will be noted, therefore, that
                                    the Japanese naval authorities have never recognized the
                                    American ownership of the cargo.</p>
                                <p>In these circumstances, if the American firm believing their
                                    ownership of the wood oil has been recognized, claims
                                    compensation for losses suffered in the original shipment (at
                                    first stated as 250 tons and later as 280 tons), it will be
                                    necessary to go over the whole question from the beginning and
                                    to require clear proof of the Werner G. Smith Company’s title to
                                    the cargo.</p>
                                <p>It is requested that the company be advised to withdraw its claim
                                    for compensation for losses suffered in the original shipment.
                                    The Japanese authorities “are prepared to consider the
                                    settlement of the case” if the American company gives assurances
                                    that a claim for the amount of the original amount will never be
                                    presented.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>2. I am replying along the following lines: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The difference between Mr. Hidaka’s statement to Mr. Lockhart
                                    (see Consulate General’s 1016, July 20, 4 p.m.) and the present
                                    position of Japanese naval authorities regarding an ownership of
                                    cargo is hard to reconcile.</p>
                                <p>The question of responsibility for losses suffered in the
                                    original shipment is for eventual determination on its merits;
                                    unjustified claims will presumably not be pressed and reasonable
                                    ones should be paid.</p>
                                <p>However, I am prepared to inform the American company of the
                                    offer to purchase the remaining wood oil provided waiver is made
                                    of the claim for that portion of original shipment which has
                                    already been lost. Before presenting this offer to the company,
                                    I should like definite assurances from the Japanese authorities
                                    that prompt payment will be made at the price asked, i. e., 11
                                    cents United States currency per pound, and that prompt steps
                                    will be taken to have the remaining cargo weighed by a public
                                    surveyor.</p>
                                <p>The apparent difference between the figures for the original
                                    shipment (250 tons at first and 280 tons later) could only be
                                    explained by telegram from Hankow, as, owing to the smaller
                                    figure being stated in long tons and the larger in short tons,
                                    no actual difference in weight exists.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>3. I suggest that Hankow now enquire of Werner G. Smith Company whether
                            they will accept the Japanese offer, so that if they accept I may be in
                            a position to settle the case upon receipt of assurances from Japanese
                            authorities that prompt payment will be made.</p>
                        <p>4. Sent to Hankow, repeated to Peiping and Nanking. By mail to Tokyo.</p>

                        <p>171. My 170, October 18, 6 p.m. Consul General Hanawa called this morning
                            and said that upon the receipt of my note of October 18 he had taken up
                            the matter at once with the Japanese military headquarters here which
                            promptly undertook an investigation with the following findings:</p>
                        <p>A party composed of Special Service Section soldiers and regular soldiers
                            was making a bandit inspection tour of the area in which Tungtzing is
                            located; on inspecting the premises of the mission they did not see the
                            Japanese proclamation and they concluded, inasmuch as there were no
                            Americans around, that the flag was being falsely used by Chinese and
                            they therefore took it down; it was not until after the flag had been
                            burned that the Japanese proclamation was shown to them by the Chinese
                            on the premises; they then realized that a serious mistake had been made
                            and planned to report the matter to headquarters here but upon their
                            return to Nanking on October 19 they found the matter was already being
                            taken up by the Japanese authorities here; the actual tearing down and
                            burning of the flag had been the act of Special Service Section men, one
                            man in particular, who were very “repentant”.</p>
                        <p>Consul General Hanawa expressed his sincere regrets over the desecration
                            of the American flag. He stated that Major Onishi, head of the Special
                            Service Section in Nanking, was prepared to call and express his
                            regrets, and that Major Onishi had informed him that the guilty persons
                            would be punished. Mr. Hanawa added that a formal reply to my note would
                            be delivered tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>There is no question but that the American flag has been and is still
                            often flown by Chinese over premises in which there is no American
                            interest; furthermore, it is possible that the Japanese proclamation was
                            not seen by the Japanese until after the flag had been torn down and
                            burned. Although there can be no excuse for the desecration of the
                            American flag at any time, I considered that in view of the above
                            circumstances and the fact that the only testimony on the incident was
                            Chinese (the acceptance of which by the Japanese military is most
                            unusual), I should accept the offer of Major Onishi to call and express
                            his regrets.</p>
                        <p>Major Onishi called this afternoon in full uniform, accompanied by Consul
                            General Hanawa. He expressed his deep regrets over the desecration of
                            the American flag and said that the guilty soldier had <pb n="508"
                                xml:id="pg_508" facs="0512"/>been punished; he stated that this man
                            had attempted to commit suicide last night. He added that special
                            measures would be taken to prevent any such incident or any molestation
                            of American property in the future. His remarks in Japanese were
                            verified by Mr. Cooper, a Japanese speaking officer who was present.</p>
                        <p>I informed Major Onishi and Consul General Hanawa that I appreciated very
                            much their expressions of regret as well as the spirit in which they
                            were made. I added that I accepted them in settlement of the incident,
                            subject to the approval of my superiors. I requested that a further
                            proclamation be posted over the American premises at Tungtzing; this, it
                            appears, has already been done, according to the American mission.</p>
                        <p>I respectfully recommend that the expressions of regret offered by these

                        <p>Reliable foreign observers report that tanks flying the Japanese flag
                            circled through the city and machine gunned some of the people.

                        <p>7. Referring to the Embassy’s telegram No. 509, October 21, 11 a.m. and
                            Department’s 271, October 19, 6 [<hi rend="italic">7</hi>] p.m. to the
                            Embassy [at the time] sentries were sent to Hackett Memorial Hospital
                            the Chinese authorities were informed of the intention and made no
                            objection.</p>
                        <p>The end sought was to guard against looting, retreating soldiers, help in
                            case of fire and general disorganized conditions and particularly to
                            give the Chinese nurses and staff a feeling of security so that they
                            would not leave as the Chinese nurses and staff of all the other
                            hospitals in Canton have done. The latter purpose was accomplished.
                            Furthermore, until yesterday the Japanese had not agreed to recognize
                            the hospital as a medical refuge. Now they have agreed and the sentries
                            have been removed.</p>

                        <p>1365. 1. American steamship <hi rend="italic">President Coolidge</hi> of
                            the Dollar Line arrived at Shanghai yesterday afternoon and after taking
                            on a number of passengers and loading 2587 boxes of gold and silver
                            bullion valued at approximately $3,500,000 United States currency was
                            preparing to leave port early this morning. Late last night the master
                            of the ship and this Consulate General were informed by the Customs that
                            owing to a “misunderstanding” regarding the shipment of bullion the
                            clearance of the vessel by the Customs must be postponed pending
                            settlement of the question or as an alternative the ship might clear
                            without bullion.</p>
                        <p>2. The bullion shipment was believed made by the Chase Bank, Shanghai to
                            Chase National Bank of New York, San Francisco. The bank at Shanghai had
                            applied at the Customs openly for permits to ship the bullion and they
                            had been granted. The Customs also had issued the clearance for the ship
                            and on the basis thereof it had been cleared at the Consulate
                            General.</p>
                        <p>3. Upon investigation this morning I learn from the Commissioner of
                            Customs that the permit for the export of the bullion had been granted
                            at the Customs on the basis of a letter addressed to him by the
                            Inspector General of Customs to the effect that this shipment was being
                            made and that the Commissioner should authorize it on the application of
                            the bank free of examination, equalization tax, export duty or other
                            charges. Later, however, after the export and import permits had been
                            granted by the Customs the Chinese Superintendent of Customs, an
                            appointee of the so-called Reformed Government, had objected to the
                            shipment as contrary to the orders of the Reformed Government and had
                            required that the clearance of the vessel be suspended. In my
                            conversation with the Customs Commissioner and his assistants the
                            Japanese Administrative Commissioner described the situation as
                            substantially that of <hi rend="italic">force majeure</hi> and, being
                            pressed by me, admitted that the action taken by the Superintendent of
                            Customs had been at the instance of or with the support of the Japanese
                            military authorities. I thereupon entered a strong oral protest with the
                            Commissioner of Customs at the action of the Customs in suspending the
                            clearance of the ship after it had been granted and after it had loaded
                            its cargo openly under export permits duly issued by the Customs. I
                            informed the Japanese Administrative Commissioner that I took a very
                            serious view of this interference by the Japanese Armed Forces with an
                            American vessel and its cargo which had been duly cleared by the Customs
                            after the issuance of the export permits <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511"
                                facs="0515"/>and that he might so inform the Japanese military or
                            naval authorities at whose instance the action was apparently taken.</p>
                        <p>4. I then called on the Japanese Consul General and informed him of the
                            matter, stating that I did so because I had learned that the action had
                            been taken at the instance of the Japanese armed forces. The Japanese
                            Consul General was thoroughly familiar with the case. He stated that the
                            Chinese reformed government who are in control in this area gave an
                            order to the Commissioner of Customs that without their permission no
                            export of bullion should be permitted and when the Chinese
                            Superintendent of Customs learned of the matter the Commissioner was
                            instructed not to allow the shipment of the bullion. He stated that the
                            position of the Japanese authorities in the matter is that they are in a
                            position to prevent the taking of this gold and silver out of Shanghai.
                            He told me that his predecessor had instructed the Commissioner of
                            Customs not to authorize the shipment out of Shanghai of arms and
                            munitions and gold and silver. The issuance of the export permits for
                            the bullion by the Customs must therefore be regarded as a mistake. He
                            [made?] the further point that some time ago the Chinese Government
                            nationalized silver and that all silver thereupon became the possession
                            of the Chinese Government. He expressed the view that the Japanese
                            Government is not in a position to make representations to the American
                            Government in this matter. I reminded the Japanese Consul General that
                            it was reported at the time that Japanese banks had refused to acquiesce
                            in any nationalization of the silver in their possession and added that
                            according to the information given to me by the Chase Bank this silver
                            or most of it had been in the vaults of that bank for several years. I
                            told the Japanese Consul General that I must protest most emphatically
                            the interference of his military, naval, Consul General, authorities
                            with the clearance and despatch of the American ship concerned after
                            that ship had loaded its cargo under export permits obtained regularly
                            and openly from the Customs and after customs clearance had been duly
                            issued and that I must reserve all American rights in connection with
                            the issue and with the loss and damage sustained by American interests
                            in consequence of the action of the Japanese authorities. I added that I
                            was reporting the matter immediately to the Department and to the
                            Ambassador at Tokyo as I felt that a most serious view must be taken of
                            this Japanese interference with the <hi rend="italic">Coolidge</hi> and
                            its cargo loaded and cleared under customs permits in the normal
                            way.</p>
                        <p>5. The steamer’s agents will probably proceed to unload the bullion in
                            order that the ship may not be longer delayed. I told the agents that in
                            view of the suspension of the clearance by the Customs I was not in a
                            position [to] advise that the ship sail without a clearance.</p>
                        <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0516"/>
                        <p>6. The Chase Bank tells me that about half of the bullion has been in its
                            vaults for several years as security for accommodations extended to the
                            Chinese from time to time and that the Chase Bank has a definite and
                            substantial interest in this silver. The bank admits that the balance of
                            the bullion was received by them from other banks and added to the
                            shipment. I was told by the bank about 2 weeks ago that it would make
                            this bullion shipment and I then expressed serious doubt whether the
                            Customs would or could permit it to be exported. When the Dollar Line
                            manager consulted me in the matter some days ago before bringing in the
                                <hi rend="italic">President Coolidge</hi> I expressed the same
                            doubt. I was therefore much surprised to learn that the export permits
                            had actually been granted by the Customs. The Chase Bank inquired
                            whether I could arrange for a marine guard during the transfer of the
                            silver. I referred the bank to the commanding officer of the United
                            States Marines and made no recommendation to that officer. Later the
                            marine commander informed me that he had authorized the guard but had
                            found upon investigation that only part of the silver was stored in the
                            vaults of the Chase Bank, the remainder being in other foreign and
                            Chinese banks and that he had been asked to provide guards to escort the
                            bullion from the other banks as well as the Chase Bank. I expressed the
                            emphatic opinion that if a guard were furnished by the marines it should
                            not be used to escort silver from any other than American banks but that
                            if the Chase Bank delivered the bullion to lighters on the waterfront as
                            the property of that bank the marine guards on the lighters could not
                            differentiate between bullion delivered from the vaults of one bank and
                            that delivered from the vaults of another. I consider that the marine
                            commander was correct in furnishing the marine guard on the lighters as
                            had been done in the past in view of the disorderly conditions in the
                            harbor and the possibility of interference with valuable cargo. There
                            have been numerous piracies at the mouth of the Yangtze and valuable
                            cargo on the river from Shanghai is exposed to possible depredations
                            from the same disorderly elements.</p>

                        <p>1368. Reference my No. 1365, October 24, 3 p.m., regarding silver
                            shipment on the <hi rend="italic">President Coolidge</hi>. Japanese
                            Consul General called on me this evening to extend his remarks of this
                            morning by saying it <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0517"/>has been
                            ascertained that the Inspector General of Customs instructed the
                            Commissioner of Customs to pass the shipment free from export duty and
                            equalization fee which in the opinion of the Japanese indicates that the
                            shipment was made on behalf of the Chinese Government or that the
                            Chinese Government would benefit therefrom. He added that the Japanese
                            authorities have serious doubt as to the ownership and origin of the
                            silver and gold and that they have rather exact information that the
                            Chase Bank was asked by the Ministry of Finance of the Chiang Kai Shek
                            government through the Central Bank of China at Shanghai to make the
                            shipment. He also alluded to my statement this morning that the Japanese
                            banks were reported at the time not to have assented to the
                            nationalization of silver and stated that those banks did eventually
                            assent to that measure.</p>

                        <p>278. Your 516, October 27, 8 p.m. The implication is that the bombing was
                            by Japanese planes. If there is any doubt as to nationality of the
                            attacking planes, please investigate immediately. Please telegraph
                            report on this point as soon as possible, repeating your reply to
                            Shanghai for relay urgently to Tokyo. In case the bombing was by
                            Japanese planes, Tokyo should make vigorous and urgent representations
                            to the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>If you have not already done so, please instruct Shanghai and Hankow to
                            bring this matter urgently to the attention of the appropriate Japanese

                        <p>24. Robert Horiguchi, press liaison officer for the Japanese Army, denied
                            last evening in conversation with a member of my staff the local rumor
                            that Kuling has been occupied by the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>He remarked that blockading the people on Kuling was “as good a method of
                            killing them off as any other.” When asked whether he meant the Chinese
                            or the missionaries, he replied “both”. Questioned as to the basis of
                            the animosity against missionaries, he answered “they report bombing
                            adjacent to their property as being directed at them and they maintain
                            schools which teach anti-Japanese propaganda. This however does not
                            apply to the Catholics.”</p>

                        <p>520. Department’s 278, October 27, 1 [<hi rend="italic">6</hi>] p.m. The
                            Embassy assumed that Tangho whence telegram from A. Aandahl was sent was
                            in Chinese occupation because telegraph communications had not been
                            broken and that hence that area including Tungpeh would not have been
                            bombed by Chinese planes. I have telegraphed A. Aandahl for verification
                            of this assumption. The Chinese Aeronautical Commission has informed the
                            Embassy categorically [that no] Chinese planes were sent to that area on
                            October 24, the day of the bombing, and added that both Tungpeh and
                            Tangho are in Chinese occupation. Such other information as the Embassy

                        <p>692. Department’s 367, October 27, 6 p.m., concerning attack on Standard
                            Oil vessel; 368, October 27, 7 p.m. concerning bullion shipment by <hi

                            Shanghai [<hi rend="italic">Chungking</hi>] presumably referring to
                            Nyhus case were received last night. I feel that in order to achieve
                            maximum effect these matters should be taken up with the Foreign
                            Minister himself. I propose to seek an appointment with Prince Konoye at
                            the earliest possible moment to make vigorous representations concerning
                            attack on Standard Oil vessel and bombing of Lutheran Mission, Tungpeh,
                            involving loss of American life as soon as I am informed by Shanghai
                            that attacking planes were Japanese, and I shall at the same time make
                            the desired statement in connection with the bullion case.</p>
                        <p>It is my opinion that these representations will have effect only if made
                            directly to Prince Konoye. It is not always possible to see him
                            immediately. Nevertheless, any brief delay is more than justified by
                            insuring direct knowledge of these matters by the Prime Minister. There
                            is of course no certainty that representations made to the Vice Minister
                            will be brought to the attention of Prince Konoye who alone is in a
                            position to bring pressure to bear on the military and naval authorities
                            in China. To insure that he will be in position to have some knowledge
                            of these cases when I call on him, these cases were taken up informally
                            with the Foreign Office today and request made for an appointment for me
                            to call on Konoye on Monday.</p>

                                with an American flag which resulted in the death of 1 American and
                                the wounding of 2 others”. Our note points out that “as a map of
                                Tungpeh showing the location of the property was furnished the
                                Japanese authorities over 7 months ago, there would appear to be no

                        <p>698. Department’s 278, October 27, 6 p.m. to Chungking, Nyhus case. An
                            essential garble in Chungking’s 520, October 29, 11 a.m., having been
                            straightened out by two telephone conversations with Gauss today, I made
                            emphatic representations to the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs after
                            repeated efforts to see the Foreign Minister had failed. I said to
                            Sawada that I regarded this as an extremely serious case because it
                            involved not only the bombing of American property but the loss of
                            American life; that it was only a wonder that greater loss of life had
                            not occurred through the repeated bombings of American property in China
                            ever since the hostilities began and that unless effective steps were
                            taken to prevent such attacks in future that risk of further incidents
                            of this nature would be continual, and I pointed out to him the
                            deplorable effect which the inevitable publicity concerning the Nyhus

                            bullion had been issued by the Chinese Customs under a misunderstanding
                            because the shipment of bullion had been prohibited both by the
                            Provisional Government and by the Japanese military authorities. I
                            replied that we do not recognize the Provisional Government nor the
                            jurisdiction thereof nor do we recognize the authority of the Japanese
                            military authorities touching this matter. The Vice Minister made no

                        <p>38. Mr. Okazaki, Japanese Consul General, has arrived and opened his
                            office in the French Concession. The Japanese military have today seized
                            the customs cruisers moored off Shameen.</p>
                        <p>Representatives of the Japanese <hi rend="italic">gendarmerie</hi> called
                            on me today and received a map and description of the American

                            promised to see that these are protected.</p>
                        <p>It has not been possible up to the present to make any arrangements for
                            the movement of vessels, passengers or mail to or from Hong Kong and it

                            awaiting opportunity, e. g., 10 American naval enlisted men are in Hong
                            Kong awaiting passage to Canton and 6 on the <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>39. On October 30, the Japanese put into effect what is termed martial
                            law in Special Administrative District Three, the former British
                            Concession in which this office and my residence are located. All
                            barricade gates are closed from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. and ingress or egress
                            forbidden. There is no apparent disorder in the city and the martial law
                            applies only to Special Administrative District Three, freedom of
                            movement apparently being permitted in other districts.</p>
                        <p>Because of the foregoing measure officers of the Consulate General living
                            in the Special Administrative District Three who are on duty after 6
                            p.m. are unable to report for duty and naval orderlies are unable to
                            carry messages to and from the <hi rend="italic">Luzon</hi>.</p>
                        <p>I believe that this selective application of martial law and other minor
                            obstructions represent the initial local steps in the larger Japanese
                            policy of dislodging other foreign interests in China. If these
                            preliminary encroachments affecting Americans are not the subject of
                            vigorous representations I believe that there is a likelihood that
                            further restrictions may be imposed more rapidly than they [otherwise?]
                            would.</p>
                        <p>I have [therefore?] written today to the Japanese Consul General
                            requesting him to note my emphatic objection to this restriction on the
                            freedom of movement of American citizens, including American officials.
                            I am informed that the acting British Consul General is also writing
                            today along similar lines.</p>

                        <p>1388. Reference bombing of American Mission at Tungpeh and Nyhus family.
                            Japanese Consul General called yesterday and stated that military report
                            discloses that Japanese planes bombed Chinese troops at Tungpeh on
                            October 24 but pilots report they did not “remember” any foreign
                            property there. Consul General stated that there was no deliberate
                            attack on American Mission property, that <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524"
                                facs="0528"/>he regretted the unfortunate occurrence, and that
                            investigation would be made by Japanese upon their capture of Tungpeh
                            which is still in Chinese hands. I pointed out that the American Embassy
                            at Peiping sent map showing this American property to Japanese Embassy
                            on March 3 and that the Japanese military authorities should therefore
                            have been aware of this mission property at Tungpeh.</p>

                                <p>My 24, October 28, 9 a.m. British naval reports from Kiukiang
                                    indicate that foreigners on Kuling numbering about 125 persons,
                                    including 30 Americans, are in an ugly situation due principally
                                    to shortage of food among Chinese forces there who are said to
                                    number between 1,000 and 3,000. It is feared that soldiers may
                                    forcibly take supplies of food from foreigners with consequent
                                    disorder. Japanese have entirely surrounded mountains on which
                                    Kuling is situated but are making no move to occupy it,
                                    preferring apparently to let the situation develop. While total
                                    evacuation foreigners believed not practicable due to number
                                    invalids at Kuling, it is hoped certain number will leave if
                                    suitable arrangements can be made. To this end the assistance of
                                    the Embassy at Tokyo is requested to bring matter before Foreign
                                    Office and request that Japanese military authorities at
                                    Kiukiang be asked to render assistance to efforts of commanders
                                    [of] British and American naval vessels at Kiukiang to assist
                                    foreigners on Kuling. British Consul General here is also
                                    communicating with Tokyo.</p>

                        <p>44. The Japanese Consul General, Katsuo Okazaki, called on me yesterday
                            and also on other Consuls General. He stated that the Canton area was
                            now a military zone and would be treated as such. It was the intention
                            of the Japanese to isolate Canton completely and not attempt to
                            rehabilitate it. Barriers and mines were being placed throughout the
                            delta to prevent small junks et cetera from slipping through carrying
                            information. The main channel of the Pearl River would be opened and it
                            was thought that soon foreign war vessels would be allowed to move on
                            giving notice of their intention as they did when the Chinese were in
                            control.</p>
                        <p>I spoke to him of our desire to send an American boat to Hong Kong soon,

                            Captain Stapler, commander South China Patrol United States Navy, has
                            made an appointment to call upon the rear admiral November 5 when the
                            matter will be discussed.</p>

                                <p>“I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
                                    October 1st relative to the demands presented by Mr. Higashi,
                                    Secretary of the Special Service Section of the Japanese Army,
                                    to the Commercial Pacific Cable Company. Electric communication
                                    in Central China, formerly administered by the National
                                    Government and temporarily put under the control of the Japanese
                                    forces after their occupation of this part of China, has been
                                    taken over by the Central China Telecommunications Company since
                                    August this year when the said company was established under the
                                    supervision of the Reformed Government. Mr. Higashi has been
                                    negotiating with the foreign cable companies concerning various
                                    problems arising from the above circumstances as the
                                    representative of the Japanese forces in the administration of
                                    electric communication, and his notification to the Commercial
                                    Pacific Cable Company is as a matter of course <pb n="527"
                                        xml:id="pg_527" facs="0531"/>fully endorsed by the Imperial
                                    Japanese Government. I am convinced that the Imperial Japanese
                                    Government will respect the rights and interests legitimately
                                    acquired by the foreign cable companies at Shanghai. It is
                                    improper, however, that the company should take advantage of the
                                    confusion now prevailing in order to claim more rights than have
                                    been formerly granted by the National Government, and Mr.
                                    Higashi’s demands regarding the transfer of the acceptance and
                                    delivery business and the checking office to the new company and
                                    the registration of the telegraphic addresses without warning
                                    are fully justified. And I approve also of his demand for the
                                    transfer of the terminal rate, inasmuch as it ought to be in the
                                    hands of the one who administers the communications business. In
                                    conclusion I have the honor to express my sincere hope that the
                                    pending matters will be settled satisfactorily by the parties
                                    concerned, as well as my firm belief that you will support my
                                    views stated above.”</p>

                        <p>47. Reference is made to telegraphic correspondence between the
                            Department and the Embassy concerning the status of the property of
                            China Merchants [Steam] Navigation Company which William Hunt and
                            Company now claims to own or control. Today when commander of South
                            China Patrol was discussing with Rear Admiral Sugikara the questions of
                            sending a vessel flying the American flag to Hong Kong, the admiral
                            brought up the question of the right of William Hunt and Company to fly
                            the American flag over the property of China Merchants Navigation
                            Company. As reported in my telegram March 29, 4 p.m.,<note n="37"

                        <p>48. The conduct of Japanese troops in the former British Concession
                            continues orderly. The restrictions referred to in my 39, November 3, 10
                            a.m., continue to be rigidly enforced.</p>
                        <p>In other sections of Hankow and Wuchang excluding the French Concession,
                            Japanese soldiers have indulged in looting and occasional violence
                            towards the native population. Wuchang is apparently worst affected.
                            Wholesale pillaging had not ceased on November 4, the date of the latest
                            message from Wuchang. Three attempts on November 1st and 2d to loot
                            buildings of the American Church Mission Hospital and molest staff
                            members were frustrated by the intervention of an American doctor.</p>
                        <p>Other American Church Mission properties in Wuchang all of which are
                            housing refugees have been broken into and ransacked, but to what extent
                            is not yet known. Caretakers of these properties have been
                            maltreated.</p>
                        <p>The assistant chief of the Navy’s Special Service Section stated
                            yesterday that Japanese sentries have been ordered to deny Chinese entry
                            to the French Concession.</p>

                                conform to that of your British and French colleagues. In this

                            American Consulate General. These cards, which he stated will be printed
                            next week, show name, age, nationality, address and occupation of
                            holder, also spaces for photograph and for stamp of this Consulate
                            General in addition to stamp of Japanese Consulate General. He stated

                            Concession areas but is to ensure freedom of movement within such areas
                            and that a separate pass issued by the Japanese military will be

                            American Mission at Tungpeh. Japanese Consul General called on me last
                            evening and stated that further military reports received show that when
                            Japanese troops were pushing south from Sin-yang toward Hankow the
                            Chinese forces had concentrated at Tungpeh with the intention of
                            launching an offensive against the Japanese column and Japanese planes
                            were sent on the morning of October 24 to bomb the western portion of
                            Tungpeh, heavy anti-aircraft fire prevented the planes from flying low
                            enough to distinguish objectives, that the Japanese Army had been aware
                            of the presence of an American church at Tungpeh but the forces had no
                            detailed map of the village so the exact location of the American
                            Mission was not known, that reconnoitering planes had been sent several
                            times after the 13th of October to locate the mission but heavy
                            anti-aircraft fire had prevented them from flying low enough to
                            distinguish any marks or to find the mission, that the bombing of the
                            mission was not deliberate, that he again expressed the regret of the
                            Japanese military and that the Japanese authorities are ready to take
                            proper steps to compensate for the damage done. He said that the
                            Japanese have not yet taken Tungpeh.</p>

                            claims to own. Please instruct the American Consul General at Canton
                            that the Department has not found the property indicated in the telegram
                            under reference to be entitled to American protection. The Consul
                            General should implement the Department’s decision only to the extent
                            necessary to interdict American protection of the property in question.
                            The Department’s decision involves neither an admission nor a denial of
                            the existence of any interest on the part of William Hunt and Company in
                            the property of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the
                            Consul General should avoid any statement which might convey a contrary

                            report that the looting of the godown by Chinese <pb n="533"

                            Consul General Okazaki called on me and said that the Japanese naval
                            authorities had noted the looting, entered the godown and found 2 dead
                            Chinese and 2 wounded. He said the Japanese authorities claimed the
                            right to take over the property as belonging to China Merchants Steam
                            Navigation Company and that the naval authorities were anxious to do
                            this at once but did not want to interfere with the American flag flying
                            over it without consultation with American authorities. He said however
                            that the Japanese Navy intended immediately to place a guard on the
                            property to prevent further looting and agreed with me to have
                            representatives of the American Consulate General, the American Navy and
                            the Japanese Navy go together to the property to inspect and note the
                            present condition of the property and contents. This is being
                            arranged.</p>
                        <p>A boat from the <hi rend="italic">Mindanao</hi> went to the property

                        <p>58. Referring to my telegram No. 56 of November 11, an inspection was
                            made of the godown and buildings yesterday and their condition and

                                likely to occur or where transportation facilities might be
                                suspended were urged where practicable to withdraw to places of

                                to men who could leave without great inconvenience. The American
                                Government continues to adhere to that policy; accordingly, the

                        <p>65. Yesterday morning I received a letter for [<hi rend="italic"
                                >from?</hi>] Dr. Logan Roots of the American Church Mission
                            Hospital, Wuchang, reporting that he had on November 13th been called to
                            St. Michael’s Church of the same mission in which Japanese soldiers had
                            trespassed and from which premises they were driving out refugees. At
                            the church Roots states that after preliminary remonstrances he “tried
                            to close the gates and stop the women being dragged off”. This action
                            angered the Japanese who thereupon “hit the United States flag on the
                            gate with their fists and threw carbolic acid in my face”. (It has been
                            subsequently learned that disinfectant solution was throw and that Dr.
                            Roots was not injured.)</p>

                        <p>I immediately despatched yesterday morning by messenger a letter to the
                            Japanese Consul General reporting the incident and requesting that
                            arrangements be made for a member of my staff to visit Wuchang “at the
                            earliest possible moment” to investigate the matter. I have thus far, as
                            in the case of all my previous communications addressed to him, received
                            no reply. Yesterday morning an officer of the United States Consulate
                            General orally asked a Japanese Vice Consul to attempt to make
                            arrangements for a visit to Wuchang this morning. No such arrangement
                            was made. The same officer this afternoon called at the Japanese
                            Consulate General and its military liaison office and, expressing a hope
                            that the matter might be expeditiously and locally settled, requested
                            facilities for visiting Wuchang this afternoon.</p>
                        <p>This request was refused on the grounds that arrangements must first be
                            made with the military authorities in Wuchang and that communications
                            between Hankow and Wuchang are very slow. It was stated that a member of
                            my staff will probably be able to visit Dr. Roots tomorrow
                            afternoon.</p>

                        <p>1416. Reference my No. 1394, November 5, 4 p.m., regarding Japanese
                            demands on the foreign cable companies. The three foreign cable
                            companies have now submitted to their consular representatives a
                            memorandum in the following sense: their only concern is the continued
                            effective operation of their services without disturbance from the <hi
                                rend="italic">de facto</hi> authorities and protection against an
                            eventual claim from the Chinese authorities that the companies have
                            without warrant broken their agreements with the National Government and
                            against a double claim for the monthly revenue balances. As the
                            companies are unable to persuade the Japanese authorities to allow a
                            continuance of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> pending cessation
                            of hostilities, they consider that the only alternatives are: (1) for
                            the respective Consuls General to insist on maintenance of the <hi
                                rend="italic">status quo</hi>, at the same time making it clear to
                            the Japanese Government that the responsibility for this decision rests
                            with their respective governments and not with the companies, or (2)
                            that the respective Consuls General advise the companies that in the
                            circumstances prevailing, there is no alternative but for the companies
                            to comply with the Japanese demands under <hi rend="italic">force
                                majeure</hi>. <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0542"/>The
                            memorandum concludes that if the first alternative is chosen the
                            companies would have to rely upon effective protection from their
                            respective governments or possible interference by the <hi rend="italic"
                                >de facto</hi> authorities with the operation of the cable services,
                            while in the second alternative, the companies would not run any risk of
                            such interference and at the same time they would presumably be
                            protected under <hi rend="italic">force majeure</hi> for eventual claims
                            from the Chinese authorities.</p>
                        <p>2. The Japanese letter and the companies’ memorandum were considered at a
                            meeting this morning of the Danish Minister, the British and Danish
                            Consuls General, the British Commercial Counselor of Embassy, and myself
                            and it was agreed that matter should be reported for the instructions of
                            our respective governments with the general suggestions that reply
                            should be sent to the Japanese Consul General declining to recognize the
                            Central China Telecommunications Company, refuting the Japanese
                            statement that the cable companies are taking advantage of the confusion
                            now prevailing in order to claim more rights than formerly granted them
                            by the National Government, and pointing out that certain adjustments to
                            meet the local situation have already been made by the cable companies
                            at the instance of the Japanese military and that no further adjustments
                            appear reasonably necessary pending the termination of hostilities when
                            a regular and orderly settlement of any questions should be possible. It
                            is further suggested that such reply if and when sent to the Japanese
                            authorities might be communicated to the cable companies with the
                            statement that the responsibility of decision in respect to specific
                            arrangements for the continuance of cable services must rest with the
                            concerned company but that if the company should decide in any case that
                            it is not in a position to meet the wishes of the Japanese authorities
                            their government is prepared to give such support as may be possible by
                            way of diplomatic representations to the Japanese authorities or

                            officer of the Japanese Consulate finally made arrangements for a member
                            of my staff to accompany him and a Japanese Vice Consul to Wuchang to
                            see Dr. Roots.</p>
                        <p>The circumstances of the incident at St. Michael’s Church as orally
                            recounted by Roots to Vice Consul Davies were as stated in my number <pb
                                n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0543"/>65. Roots attributes the
                            disrespect to the American flag and the deliberate spraying of
                            carbolic-phenol solution in his face [more?] to a desire on the part of
                            the Japanese to punish him than an act of violence towards them [<hi

                            disposition and kept his temper.</p>
                        <p>The issue seems to me to be, firstly, trespass on American property,
                            secondly, disrespect to the American flag, thirdly, action intended to
                            harm an American citizen and, fourthly, obstruction by the Japanese
                            authorities to this office in its desire to establish contact with an
                            American citizen.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Consulate General and military liaison office display every
                            indication of wishing the case to be considered closed. If the
                            Department perceives no objection I am prepared to write the Japanese
                            Consul General stating that I am willing to consider the incident closed
                            on the understanding that effective measures will be taken to prevent a
                            recurrence of similar cases and on the understanding that if in the
                            future this office desires to communicate with an American citizen
                            prompt facilities to do so will be extended where necessary.</p>

                                which has already been lost.” The letter continues to the effect
                                that there now seems to be “some means of disposing of the said wood
                                oil at Nanking and the Japanese naval authorities are willing,
                                should the company so desire, to deliver the remaining cargo to the

                        <p>65. Referring to the Department’s telegram No. 291, November 11, noon, to
                            the Embassy and Canton’s 54, November 10th;<note n="45"
                                xml:id="d733fn45">Telegram No. 54 not printed.</note> 56, November
                            11th; 58, November 12th. During a call on the Japanese Consul General on
                            November 18 by Mr. Linnell and myself the matter of Hunt and Company’s
                            interest in the local China Merchants [Steam] Navigation Company
                            property was raised by the Consul General. He stated that the Japanese
                            authorities were satisfied that Hunt and Company were not the owners of
                            the China Merchants’ godown and wharf properties here, that the local
                            naval authorities desired to take over this property but that being
                            anxious to avoid the seizure of American property they wish to ascertain
                            whether Hunt and Company were owners of the contents of the godowns or
                            any part thereof. He was informed that this office had no information
                            concerning Hunt and Company’s interest if any in the contents of the
                            godowns but that if any information in regard to that is obtained it
                            will be brought to his attention. The Consul General intimated that the
                            naval authorities could be expected to take over property in question
                            (and also godown and wharf properties) soon unless it were foreign owned
                            as indicated in my telegram November 12, 11 a.m. This office has no
                            reason to believe that the property within the godown is American owned.
                            At present the Japanese are in control of godown and wharf properties
                            and are displaying a Japanese flag on a short pole but have not
                            interfered with American flag still flying from main flag staff on
                            property. Although it would appear to be desirable to remove the
                            American flag from this property it seems that any action on our part to
                            effect such removal might be misunderstood. In view of all the
                            circumstances in this case this office does not propose to take any
                            action with a view to removing the flag at this time or to obtaining the
                            information desired by the Japanese but suggests that the Department <pb
                                n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0545"/>might deem it advisable to ask
                            Shanghai to give China Merchants Navigation Company an opportunity to
                            show whether contents are American owned.</p>

                            under date of November 16: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The recent refusal of the Japanese authorities and/or their

                                    Bank is particularly important in my opinion, because it
                                    involves an attempt by the Japanese authorities to stop trade
                                    between China and the United States, although such trade is
                                    permitted by the regulations of the lawful Government of China.
                                    The logical conclusion of this action, if allowed to stand, is
                                    the regulation of Sino-American trade in the interests of Japan,
                                    insofar as the Japanese for the time being have the power to
                                    carry out such measures.</p>
                                <p>If the Japanese are permitted to ‘get away’ with this
                                    interference it will undoubtedly be used by them as a precedent
                                    for further action detrimental to the interests of both China
                                    and the United States. I very much hope therefore that the
                                    action taken by the American Government in connection with this
                                    and other similar matters will result in the removal of such
                                    interferences with Sino-American trade.</p>
                                <p>I should greatly appreciate being advised of further
                                    developments.”</p>

                        <p>217. My October 17, 4 p.m., and political report for October transmitted
                            with my despatch 677.<note n="46" xml:id="d735fn46">Neither
                                printed.</note> Within a week an American and a German have been
                            fired at in the Race Club grounds during daylight by unseen assailants
                            whose motive remains obscure, and <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542"
                                facs="0546"/>there has been frequent firing at night in the area
                            outside the Concessions and adjacent to the Race Club. Most of the
                            foreigners resident in this area are British and German but there are
                            two American families there and, of course, many Americans use the Race
                            Club. The Race Club has now hired and posted its own armed guards.</p>
                        <p>Repeated representations have been made by the consular representatives,
                            including myself, to the Chinese police who have promised but have not
                            given adequate protection; British and German Consuls General have made
                            informal representations to the Japanese and the matter was discussed at
                            a consular body meeting at which time the Japanese consular
                            representatives promised to look into the situation, but conditions have
                            not improved. It appears that no effective measures will be taken by the
                            Chinese police unless in cooperation with or under the orders of the
                            Japanese, and the British Consul General is now sending a communication
                            to the Japanese Consul General stating that prior to the present
                            hostilities order was preserved in this area by armed Chinese police;
                            that as the Japanese do not allow arms to an adequate force of Chinese
                            police he will hold the Japanese responsible for the safety of British
                            nationals, and calling upon the Japanese to ensure adequate protection.
                            I understand that this course has already been followed by the British
                            with regard to the Kailan Mining Administration property at and near
                            Tongshan.</p>
                        <p>The French and German Consuls General are prepared to send similar
                            communications to the Japanese Consul General, but before sending a
                            communication of the same nature on behalf of American nationals I wish
                            to be informed whether either the Embassy or the Department perceives
                            any objection as a matter of principle to my doing so.</p>
                        <p>The obvious alternatives to asking the Japanese to ensure protection are
                            the withdrawal of the two American families from that area or the
                            posting of marine guards on their property in case the situation should
                            seem to warrant either course. Neither of these courses would be more
                            than a temporary emergency measure and would not materially affect the
                            safety of Americans using the Race Club.</p>

                            21 I wrote to the Japanese Consul General in part as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“This Consulate General, having completed an investigation of the
                                    case, is prepared to consider the incident closed on the
                                    understanding that measures have been taken to prevent the
                                    recurrence of similar incidents in the future and that should
                                    this office again consider it necessary to establish personal
                                    contact with an American citizen in Wuchang, it may be enabled
                                    to do so without delay.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I assumed that the Department did not object to this procedure since I
                            had received no reply to my telegram No. 70, November 17, 6 p.m.</p>
                        <p>This morning I called on the Japanese Consul General and informed him
                            that I had been instructed to request an expression of regret in
                            connection with this case. He stated that from his information the case
                            was not serious but that he would say that it was very regrettable that
                            misunderstandings of this kind took place. I stated that while
                            fortunately it was not serious yet I could not treat it as
                            unintentional; that the facts as told by Roots were that a Japanese
                            soldier had intentionally struck the American flag and also sprayed
                            carbolic solution on Roots. I stated, however, that I would accept his
                            statement that the affair was regrettable.</p>

                        <p>565. William R. Johnson, American missionary, in a letter dated November
                            4 from Nanchang, Kiangsi, reported to the Embassy that in air raid
                            experienced at Nanchang on October 31 several bombs were dropped in
                            vicinity of property of Methodist Episcopal Mission, that none of the
                            bombs directly struck property of mission, that fragments of bombs
                            pierced 4 mission buildings destroying doors, screens, plaster and
                            woodwork and that 1 man was killed and several others (presumably all
                            Chinese) were wounded on mission property as a result of bombing.
                            Although American citizens were present on mission premises at time of
                            bombing, all escaped injury or death. No estimate of total property
                            damages was given.</p>
                        <p>In an attached “news note” dated November 3 Mr. Johnson commented <hi
                                rend="italic">inter alia</hi> that on <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“October 31st occurred the worst bombing in the history of the
                                    city as far as civilian bombings are concerned. Two hundred
                                    bombs fell over 9 of the 10 police precincts. Successive
                                    squadrons of planes crossed the city from various directions. If
                                    there were military objectives there is little evidence of it. I
                                    have seen scores of places where bombs were dropped but scarcely
                                    one where there is any military objective apparent. Five bombs
                                    fell on properties of Methodist institution in the north
                                    suburbs, and 3 more within 15 feet of the boundaries of these
                                    properties, one within 25 yards of a large American flag on the
                                    platform on the ground. No Methodist owned building was struck,
                                    but one small bomb or a number of hand grenades struck at few
                                    yards south of the main hospital building, wounding four
                                    patients in the wards and spraying with glass Misses Julia
                                    Bradley and Evaline Gaw (American citizens), though neither was
                                    injured. In the city scores were killed and hundreds wounded

                        <p>This office has received from the Senior Consul a copy of a letter of
                            November 23rd from the Japanese Consul General. Japanese forces are
                            beginning to bombard from the air Chinese troops in the area surrounded
                            by a line connecting Yeungkong, Wuchow, Linhsien, Shiuchow, Lungnam,
                            Hoyuen and Hoifong and repeating the request which has been made by
                            Japanese authorities on numerous occasions that nationals of the various
                            countries located within the indicated area should have distinguishing
                            marks on their properties which can be clearly seen from the air.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the Japanese Consul General I have, in addition to requesting
                            that adequate steps be taken to avoid endangering the lives and
                            properties of American citizens, called attention to the fact owing to
                            interrupted communications it is not possible to communicate with
                            American citizens in that area within a reasonable time, that American
                            citizens registered at this Consulate General have on previous occasions
                            been advised to put distinguishing marks on their properties and that
                            there are 80 registered American citizens in this area besides possibly
                            others who have not been so registered.</p>
                        <p>This office is sending a circular notice to American citizens in the area
                            indicated apprising them of the Japanese request and advising American
                            citizens particularly women and children, who find it practicable to do
                            so to seek places of safety.</p>

                        <p>The British gunboat <hi rend="italic">Cicala</hi> on November 2 proceeded
                            from Canton to Kongmoon despite refusal of permission by Japanese
                            authorities. On November 7 the Japanese indicated that foreign naval
                            vessels might navigate the Pearl River between Canton and Hong Kong as
                            from November 10. Under this authorization other vessels have been
                            allowed as naval auxiliaries to carry foreign passengers and relief
                            supplies but the Pearl River remains closed to commercial traffic.</p>
                        <p>On November 1 the Japanese military seized control of the customs
                            cruisers off Shameen. On November 9 Japanese consular and military
                            officers went about the Canton customshouse and informed the acting
                            commissioner that they were taking over the Chinese Maritime Customs as
                            from 2 p.m. that day; that the customs staff were not to perform their
                            duties outside the customshouse without agreement with the Japanese
                            authorities but that they might continue their duties <pb n="549"
                                xml:id="pg_549" facs="0553"/>inside the customshouse; that the
                            Japanese authorities were to be given access to necessary documents when
                            required; and that no funds were to be transferred to the Inspector
                            General without their consent.</p>
                        <p>A number of cases [are reported?] of violation of American rights by
                            Japanese soldiers [who?] looted the home of an American citizen and so
                            far no satisfactory answer has been made to this office’s protests. On
                            November 7 Japanese soldiers broke into the Wallace Harper garage and
                            took an American-owned car which has not yet been returned. On November
                            9 Japanese soldiers broke into and occupied the clearly marked American
                            property of the Swedish-American Mission. In response to protests from
                            this office they evacuated on November 4 [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].
                            Early in the month property of the National City Bank was similarly
                            occupied. Despite promises to do so, the Japanese military have not yet
                            completely evacuated the property. Protests were also made against
                            denial of freedom of movement of American missionaries in Tungshan,
                            against the beating of a coolie of the American-owned Canton Hospital

                            Flag—Claim of William Hunt &amp; Company”. The above cited despatch
                            reported the transfer, by sale, from the Chinese flag to the British
                            flag of two more of the four steamers built by or for the China
                            Merchants Steam Navigation Company with funds loaned by the British
                            Boxer Indemnity Fund Commission. I have now to report the completion of
                            the sale and transfer of the fourth and last one of these steamers by
                            the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to the local British firm
                            of Jardine, Matheson &amp; Company, Ltd. The price was the same as that
                            reported for the other three steamers—85,000 pounds sterling. This
                            fourth steamer, which was the S. S. <hi rend="italic">Hai Lee</hi>, has
                            now been named the S. S. <hi rend="italic">Ming Sang</hi> by her new

                        <p>All of these steamers, excepting the last one which is understood to be
                            still in dock, have been placed on regular runs for the new company, and
                            to the best of our knowledge and belief there has been no molestation by

                                metres over Sutsien on the 5th of November, it was machine gunned by
                                certain Chinese troops, outside the south wall of the city. The army
                                plane, making a descent, fired some 30 shots upon the Chinese
                                attackers. At the moment the army airplane, noticing an American
                                flag on the ground near the area, stopped the firing at once and
                                returned to its aviation field. In this connection, it should be
                                made clear that not only the size of the American flag which is
                                small but as it was raised on the pole, its visibility was very poor
                                by that plane on a high altitude and especially under such
                                circumstances.”</p>

                            the American hospital and that it stopped attacking “at once on noticing
                            the American flag, even sacrificing the advantages in its operations”.
                            The note also states that <quote rend="blockquote">

                            Rosse, representative of Hunt and Company who is now in Canton, has
                            received instructions from Hunt that “as a public warehouse company we
                            will be held responsible for the safety of all cargoes within our
                            warehouse and we cannot admit right to entry by Japanese or interest in
                            cargoes or information as to details thereof”.</p>
                        <p>On the evening of December 14 the Japanese Vice Consul called at this
                            office, stated that the Japanese naval authorities had just received a
                            cargo of rice for which they lacked storage facilities and that they
                            therefore proposed to open one of the empty godowns of the China
                            Merchants Company early this morning and to store the rice therein. The
                            Vice Consul stated that the Japanese would like to have a representative
                            of this office or of the American Navy present at the godown to witness
                            the action. He was informed that since the Japanese authorities had
                            decided to occupy the godown the Consulate General perceived no
                            necessity for any American witness; that regardless of such occupation
                            the status of the properties would remain the same as heretofore and
                            that the Consul General neither denied nor admitted the existence of an
                            interest on the part of Hunt and Company in any or all of the properties
                            in question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rosse was told December 14 of the proposed action by the Japanese and
                            indicated that he would not then take any steps in the matter. Mr. Rosse
                            has today requested me in writing to protest to the Japanese against the
                            occupation of godown and against the right of the Japanese to seize any
                            of the property or to move any of the contents from godowns. In the
                            light of the Department’s 291, November 11, noon, to Chungking and 627,
                            November 22, 7 p.m., to Shanghai, I informed Mr. Rosse that the Consul
                            General was not in position to take action as requested.</p>
                        <p>The possibility of the Japanese withdrawing their guards from the
                            property now appears remote.</p>

                        <p>The American Government agrees with the British Government that the
                            possibility of eventually giving the cable companies diplomatic support
                            vis-à-vis the Chinese Government would depend upon the circumstances in
                            which any action complained of might have taken place.</p>
                        <p>On December 12, presumably in accord with an understanding with his
                            British and Danish colleagues, the American Consul General at Shanghai
                            replied to Japanese demands in a communication to the Japanese Consul
                                General.<note n="64" xml:id="d753fn64">Not printed.</note> The
                            American Consul General declined to recognize the Central China
                            Telecommunications Company, denied the Japanese statement that the cable
                            companies are taking advantage of the present situation in order to
                            claim more rights than those formerly granted them by the National
                            Government of China, pointed out that certain adjustments to meet the
                            local situation have already been made by the cable companies at the
                            instance of the Japanese military and stated that no further adjustments
                            would appear to be reasonably called for pending the termination of
                            hostilities at which time an orderly settlement of any outstanding
                            questions should be possible.</p>
                        <p>The American Consul General was authorized to inform the American cable
                            company concerned of the reply made to the Japanese Consul General and
                            to say that any specific arrangements for the continuance of cable
                            services must be made upon the responsibility of the cable company but
                            that, if in any specific instance the company should decide that it was
                            not in a position to meet the wishes of the Japanese authorities, the
                            American Government would be prepared to give such support as might be
                            possible by way of diplomatic representations to the Japanese
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State is favorably disposed in principle toward the
                            British Government’s proposal for a parallel approach at Tokyo but
                            offers for consideration the thought that, in view of the circumstance
                            that the American Consul General at Shanghai, presumably in accord with
                            parallel action by his British and Danish colleagues, has already
                            replied to the Japanese Consul General in regard to the merits of the
                            questions involved, it would be preferable to await further developments
                            before making such an approach.</p>

                        <p>It will be noted that Mr. Smyth states that, although the Japanese

                            adds that it seems evident that, certainly in some matters, the Japanese

                        <p>Social restrictions imposed by the Japanese on Americans and other
                            foreigners in November continued throughout December with only slight
                            alleviations in certain instances. The Japanese occupied a house owned
                            by an American mission at Hankow and also mission property at Hanchuan,
                            Hupeh. Some apprehension has been felt among Americans at possible
                            tightening of local restrictions on account of reported American loan to
                            China. About 35 foreign nationals including 16 Americans evacuated
                            Kuling and left for Shanghai by Japanese transport December 10. Eighteen
                            Americans remain at Kuling. An exchange of foreign gunboats between
                            Shanghai and this area was carried out [according to?] proposal of
                            Japanese naval authorities under which three American gunboats, <hi

                            words, has for some time been inferred from conversations with Japanese

                            made by local opium merchants with Governor Barbosa. The Governor
                            furnished negro troops who escorted the shipment into Macao at night and
                            is said to have been paid $400 per case for this service. Ten Chinese
                            opium merchants cooperated with the Japanese in this transaction, the
                            most important of whom is But Lui Kim (Cantonese dialect), head of troop

                            first referred his information to the Japanese authorities through the
                            regular channels in order that the Japanese side of the matter could
                            have been given before a public statement was made. We made clear in
                            replying that on April 30, 1938, the Embassy had furnished the Foreign
                            Office with a copy of the seizure report referred to and that to date we
                            had received no report of any investigation which the Japanese
                            authorities may have made in connection therewith.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office added that Fuller’s statement that 2875 cases of opium
                            had been purchased by Japanese merchants for importation <pb n="562"
                                xml:id="pg_562" facs="0566"/>into China was inaccurate, and that the
                            facts are that 3228 cases were purchased by Japanese merchants for legal
                            entry into Manchuria, North China, Macao, Dairen, and Siam. The Foreign
                            Office stated that according to an investigation carried out last March
                            there was not a single case of the clandestine manufacture or sale of
                            narcotics in the Japanese Concession in Tientsin at that time.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Comment</hi>: We feel that there has recently been
                            shown by the Foreign Office a genuine desire to cooperate with us on the
                            question of suppressing illicit international narcotics traffic. We
                            gained the distinct impression at the above mentioned interview at the
                            Foreign Office that, if the Japanese continue to be subjected at Geneva
                            to public criticism without previous reference to them of information
                            involving Japanese complicity with such traffic, we cannot expect to
                            receive anything more than perfunctory interest in the control of that
                            traffic.</p>

                            Minister, absent from the city, called afternoon June 23 on Chief
                            European Division to express pained surprise and disappointment of
                            Portuguese Government at what it considered unwarranted attack on
                            Portuguese colony of Macao in matter of opium smuggling as brought out
                            by you before Opium Advisory Committee. The Portuguese Government
                            contends that your allegations are unfounded and is disappointed that
                            you made your public statement without advance notice to Portuguese
                            Delegate who could have cleared up many misunderstandings.</p>

                            to the statements concerning the drug situation in China made by the
                            American representative at the recent session of the Opium Advisory
                            Committee at Geneva.</p>
                        <p>These reports have been read with interest, describing as they do a
                            course of action strikingly similar to that which has, in the past, been
                            attempted by nation after nation when failure to cooperate in the
                            international effort to cope with the drug evil has been brought to
                            light. The difference is found in the fact that Japan, after admitting
                            the flooding of China with high morphine-content opium and the setting
                            up in China of unrecognizable regimes among whose first acts in each
                            instance has been to do away with measures to suppress the abuse of
                            narcotic drugs, endeavors to represent this destruction of existing
                            control as cooperation and to justify it as technically permissible
                            under the international drug conventions.</p>
                        <p>From the data which have been previously sent to the Embassy, you will
                            have noted how direct is the interest of the United States in the
                            situation in China, north and south of the Great Wall, in regard to
                            opium and opiates.</p>
                        <p>Practically all of the smoking opium found in the illicit traffic in the
                            United States comes from China and is a blend of Chinese and <pb n="564"
                                xml:id="pg_564" facs="0568"/>Iranian opiums. Part of it is prepared
                            in and near Shanghai, part in South China and a little in North China.
                            This type of smoking opium has practically no market in China and is put
                            up solely for the illicit traffic in America.</p>
                        <p>Heroin found in the illicit traffic in the United States has, for some
                            years past, come from China, since 1935 mostly from the Japanese
                            Concession in Tientsin. Persian opium, on account of its high morphine
                            content, lends itself particularly well to the manufacture of
                            heroin.</p>
                        <p>Most of the raw opium found in the illicit traffic in the United States
                            is Iranian opium, a great part of which is smuggled into the United
                            States from China.</p>
                        <p>The recent unprecedented movement of Iranian opium to China and action
                            taken by the regimes set up in China by the Japanese Army in respect of
                            narcotics control are thus, naturally, matters of deep concern to the
                            American Government.</p>
                        <p>It is regretted that it was not possible to place more detailed
                            information in your hands before June 20, when the Japanese Foreign
                            Office took up with the Embassy the question of the discussions which
                            took place in Geneva. The Department, however, with a view to placing

                            Iran. There was no occasion to consult in advance the Government of
                            Japan unless to protest the setting up by its army in China of so-called
                            governments among whose principal objects has invariably been the making
                            of money through encouragement of the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs,
                            a course of action followed regardless of law and to the prejudice of
                            all nations, especially the United States. The political element thus
                            involved could not be discussed in the Opium Advisory Committee, which
                            is a technical committee in which political discussions are barred.
                            Otherwise, it might have been pointed out that, when Wen Tsung-Yau and
                            his associates wished to set up their drug business in China, they went
                            to the Japanese Army which incorporated them in “The Provisional
                            Government” at Nanking, but that when Wen’s daughter attempted to extend
                            her drug business to the United States, the American Government sent her
                            to the penitentiary.</p>
                        <p>The following data are intended to serve as background to aid the Embassy
                            in its consideration of matters in which the traffic in narcotic drugs
                            in China is involved:</p>
                        <p>In the case of Manchuria and Jehol and in that of other parts of China
                            under Japanese military occupation, the government recognized as the
                            sovereign (i. e., the Chinese National Government) is prevented by
                            existing conditions, created in large part by Japanese action, from
                            obtaining official information as to the situation. This puts the case
                            on a footing which differentiates it from the case of areas in which
                            recognized governments function. Discussion in the Opium Advisory
                            Committee could not be based on information supplied by the recognized
                            sovereign of the territory, because such information was not to be had.
                            All nations with facilities for obtaining such information are therefore
                            regarded as privileged to present it <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566"
                                facs="0570"/>without obligation to consult in advance the Japanese
                            or any other government.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese representatives at the Opium Advisory Committee have
                            hitherto disclaimed responsibility for the regimes set up in China by
                            the Japanese army and have taken the position that those regimes are
                            independent governments which Japan has recognized as such. This is
                            particularly so in the case of “Manchukuo”.</p>
                        <p>Channels for obtaining and supplying to the Opium Advisory Committee
                            information in regard to the situation in respect of the narcotics

                            agreed upon between the United States and nations members of the League
                            of Nations in 1934 on the basis set forth in circular letter No. C. L.

                            In that letter is outlined the procedure which has been recognized and
                            followed ever since with the apparent acquiescence of Japan, whose
                            representatives have themselves circulated information concerning
                            “Manchukuo” without prior consultation with the Chinese or any other
                            government. In this connection attention is invited to the Department’s
                            instruction No. 441 of January 20, 1934,<note n="93" xml:id="d768fn93"

                        <p>Information from Iran concerning raw opium despatched from Bushire for
                            the Far East by Japanese, Chinese, British, Netherland and German ships
                            has been regularly produced and discussed annually in the Opium Advisory
                            Committee for many years past without the slightest suggestion on the
                            part of anyone that the government whose flag the ship flew should be
                            consulted in advance. The Japanese Government must have known that this
                            data would be discussed as usual. On occasion, in the past, the Japanese
                            Government has even promised to take steps that would penalize Japanese
                            shipmasters for carrying opium from Iran to China.</p>
                        <p>As you point out in one of the despatches under reply, the specific case
                            mentioned by Mr. Fuller of illicit traffic from the Japanese Concession
                            in Tientsin to the United States between 1935 and 1937 was duly reported
                            to the Japanese Government through regular channels under the Narcotics

                            been developed. This provision was designed to prevent the very course
                            which the Japanese Foreign Office now <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567"
                                facs="0571"/>appears to suggest. The Japanese Government, which must
                            have known that the case in question would be discussed in the Opium
                            Advisory Committee’s Twenty-third Session, had over forty days in which
                            to investigate and present its statement in the matter.</p>
                        <p>Adverting to Mr. Mitani’s letter of July 30, 1938,<note n="96"
                                xml:id="d768fn96">Not printed; Mr. Mitani was Chief of the Treaty
                                Bureau, Japanese Foreign Office.</note> it may be pointed out that
                            the attitude of the Japanese Government toward the abuse of narcotic
                            drugs speaks for itself. For over ten years, Japan’s official
                            representatives, admitting the futility of their existing measures to
                            prevent illicit traffic, have done no more than to present vague
                            promises to reform Japanese legislation so that it will provide adequate
                            penalties for illicit trafficking and will set up efficient control of
                            the distribution of narcotic drugs. Year after year these same
                            assurances have been given but nothing has been done. Even the existing
                            legislation seems not to be enforced. Recently the keeper of a bar in
                            Japan had only to go around the corner and openly buy at a pharmacy
                            without any prescription a quantity of cocaine beyond any medicinal
                            dose, for delivery to a sailor, to be smuggled into the United States.
                            (In this connection, please see your despatch No. 3054 of June 25,
                                1938<note n="97" xml:id="d768fn97">Not printed.</note>). This state
                            of affairs has been the subject of public comment for years past.</p>
                        <p>No convincing justification has yet been produced by the Japanese for the
                            flood of Iranian opium which has admittedly been imported into China
                            north and south of the Great Wall by Japanese interests. Whether those
                            interests were military or civilian, all that has been produced is an
                            attempted justification on purely technical grounds for refraining from
                            prosecuting or interfering with the Japanese concerned in thus building
                            up this serious menace to the rest of the world. This attempted
                            justification is based on the assertion that the so-called “governments”
                            which have been set up through the impulsion of the Japanese Army have
                            entrusted to certain Japanese and Chinese individuals the actual control
                            of narcotics. The responsibility of the Japanese Government in this
                            matter is inescapable.</p>
                        <p>It will thus be seen that the Japanese Government, while confirming the
                            factual data, appears to avoid the issue by importing political
                            considerations which involve recognition of puppet governments that its
                            army has set up in China.</p>
                        <p>International cooperation is not limited to the exchange of information,
                            important though that feature is. It calls for positive action to ensure
                            effective control of the drugs and effective punishment for offenses
                            against the laws controlling narcotic drugs.</p>
                        <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0572"/>
                        <p>So far as Japan itself is concerned, the cooperation which has been
                            extended by the Japanese Government to the Government of the United
                            States has been extended for only a few years past and has consisted
                            merely in more or less perfunctory investigation of a few specific cases
                            of illicit traffic. Even in those cases no effective action has been
                            taken against persons implicated in Japan and no effective steps appear
                            to have been taken to provide for strict control of drugs or for the
                            imposition in future of penalties that would act as deterrents.</p>
                        <p>It is true that the Nippon Yusen Kaisha has taken effective steps to put
                            a stop to the use of its ships for the smuggling of narcotics. This was
                            done to avoid the heavy fines that were being imposed on Nippon Yusen
                            Kaisha vessels for bringing narcotics to American ports.</p>
                        <p>All the results that have been accomplished in the past twenty years in
                            the fight against the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs have been
                            attained only after the application of pitiless publicity. It is that
                            and that only which, in the case of offenders, has finally brought about
                            international cooperation. Japan is by no means the only nation which
                            has brought such publicity upon herself. Other nations have come to a
                            realization that the only way to avoid such publicity is by showing
                            sincere and effective effort to cooperate in the campaign against the
                            illicit traffic. It is to be hoped that the Japanese Government will
                            take measures, such as past experience has shown are necessary, to meet
                            its obligations in this matter. To that end, it is gratifying to note
                            that the Japanese authorities are at last becoming sensitive to the
                            general disapproval of their attitude toward the narcotic traffic.</p>
                        <p>The idea of prior consultation with the authorities of the offending
                            country before reporting on illicit traffic is one that has been
                            advanced in the past. It has always been proposed with a view to
                            defeating the very object of the exchange of such information. In the
                            present instance, it appears to have been suggested with the additional
                            object of evoking some sort of recognition for the position occupied by
                            Japan in China today and of the puppet governments which the Japanese
                            Army has set up.</p>
                        <p>The Department has noted the opinion expressed in Mr. McGurk’s memorandum
                            of June 20, 1938<note n="98" xml:id="d768fn98">Not printed; Joseph F.
                                McGurk was First Secretary of Embassy in Japan.</note> that nothing
                            more than perfunctory interest in prevention of the illicit traffic in
                            narcotic drugs may be expected from the Japanese Government unless the
                            practice is instituted of prior reference to the Japanese authorities of
                            all matters involving complicity of Japanese nationals before criticism
                            of such complicity is made public.</p>
                        <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0573"/>
                        <p>This suggested departure from long established practice would constitute
                            no less than a suppression of information and, as such, action in
                            derogation of the Narcotics Limitation Convention of 1931.</p>
                        <p>The Department doubts whether participation of the American Government in
                            such suppression of information would tend in any measure to increase
                            the present apparently perfunctory interest of the Japanese authorities
                            in narcotic drug control or in suppression of the illicit traffic, or
                            would tend to render effective the Japanese contribution to cooperative
                            international effort to suppress the abuse of narcotic drugs. In similar
                            situations in the past, in China and elsewhere, publicity has proved the
                            only effective means of bringing about real cooperation.</p>
                        <p>The menace to the United States which arises from the accumulation in
                            China, through the agency of Japanese interests, of these huge
                            quantities of opium and opiates is necessarily a matter of direct and
                            serious concern to the American Government, as the United States is the
                            principal victim of the resultant illicit traffic. The Department is
                            considering the making of representations to the Japanese Government in
                            regard to the matter when an opportune moment arrives.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the foregoing, the Department will appreciate receiving
                            your views on the proposal for undertaking to consult the Japanese
                            authorities (any more than those of other countries other than China) in
                            advance before giving publicity to information concerning the illicit
                            traffic from China to the United States, bearing in mind the political
                            implications which would be involved; and also your views as to whether
                            the desire of the Japanese, expressed repeatedly during many years past,
                            to cooperate with other nations in these matters, may be expected to

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Department’s confidential instruction no. 1574 of
                            September 12, 1938, with its enclosures<note n="99" xml:id="d769fn99"
                                >Enclosures not printed.</note> (File No. 500.C1197/1240), relating
                            to the drug situation in China as reported in the statements of the
                            American representative at the last session of the Opium Advisory
                            Committee at Geneva. The Embassy has carefully noted, and appreciates,
                            the background <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0574"/>information and
                            the Department’s views as set forth in that instruction.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has delayed its reply to the instruction under acknowledgment
                            in the expectation that, without soliciting it, the Japanese authorities
                            would make orally or otherwise to the Embassy some explanation or
                            statement further in regard to their attitude on the situation in China
                            as exposed by the American delegate. Although a member of the Embassy
                            staff has had on many occasions conversations on other matters
                            pertaining to the narcotics traffic with the official of the Foreign
                            Office in charge of that work, no reference has been made by that
                            official to the situation in China or to the expose of our delegate.</p>
                        <p>It has been noted, however, that there has been a slackening in
                            cooperation on the part of the Japanese authorities since they first
                            called our attention, as reported in the Embassy’s telegram No. 400,
                            June 22, 6 p.m., to the statements of our delegate at Geneva. Though
                            there have been only two or three cases of a minor nature and the
                            Turevic case since that time we have noted that the Japanese authorities
                            have not been as prompt as heretofore in replying to our inquiries.</p>
                        <p>In this relation and with respect to the question of undertaking to
                            consult with the Japanese authorities in advance before giving publicity
                            to information concerning the illicit traffic conducted by Japanese in
                            China and the illicit traffic to the United States from the areas in
                            China controlled by the Japanese, the Embassy refers to its opinion
                            given in the penultimate paragraph of confidential despatch No. 3181 of
                            August 11, 1938,<note n="1" xml:id="d769fn1">Not printed.</note> to the
                            effect that we are not in a position to determine whether the advantages
                            derived from unrestricted publication of information with regard to
                            illicit Japanese activities in China are greater than the advantages
                            which flow from the effective cooperation of the Japanese Government in
                            preventing the illicit shipment of narcotics to the United States.</p>
                        <p>We desire to point out, however, that the Japanese authorities here in
                            Japan with whom we have had to deal in connection with the illicit
                            traffic in narcotics have shown a sincere desire to cooperate in the
                            suppression of this traffic. Just what influence or control they may
                            have over their nationals or the military authorities in China it is not
                            possible to say, but we do believe that if the Japanese authorities here
                            in Japan could first be furnished in entire confidence, as in the case
                            of all our local dealings, with whatever information we have regarding
                            the activities in the illicit traffic in narcotics of their nationals in
                            China they might be in a better position to take some action vis-à-vis
                            the military authorities.</p>
                        <p>The military authorities in China are not likely to be affected by
                            publicity in connection with the narcotics traffic any more than they
                                <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0575"/>appear to be sensitive to
                            publicity given to other features of their activities in China. On the
                            other hand the local authorities with whom we have to deal are sensitive
                            to the adverse effect of such publicity and if placed in a position
                            where direct approach could be made to the higher military command in
                            Tokyo before the military in China are aware that their activities are
                            the subject of protest, some good results might be expected.</p>
                        <p>It was with the foregoing in mind that the suggestion was made that the
                            Japanese authorities here be furnished in confidence with information
                            regarding the activities of their nationals in China in connection with
                            the illicit traffic in narcotics, in accordance with the agreement
                            referred to in the copy of the letter from the Director of the Treaty
                            Bureau dated July 30, 1938, enclosed with our confidential despatch No.
                            3181 of August 11, 1938.<note n="2" xml:id="d769fn2">Neither
                                printed.</note> The suggestion was not intended to convey the idea
                            that action be taken in derogation of the Narcotics Limitation
                            Convention of 1931, nor was it our intention to suggest that information
                            should be suppressed.</p>

                        <p>I realize the difficulty of adequate means for distributing relief to the
                            Chinese civilian population but, at the same time, I think that from
                            many points of view it would be right and proper for us to take a
                            greater part in such relief work than we are doing today.</p>
                        <p>Would you be good enough to talk this over and let me have your views? I
                            would be happy to give approval to any appeal by the Red Cross for funds
                            for destitute Chinese civilians. The same thing applies to funds to be
                            spent for medical aid.</p>
                        <p>I am confident that any such appeal would meet a very wide response, and
                            I think we could raise $1,000,000 without any trouble at all. No
                            question of giving Red Cross assistance to Japan arises because no
                            Japanese civilians need medical treatment or relief of destitution.</p>

                        <p>32. Red Cross requests that there be sent to you a message reading as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“For your confidential information the American Red Cross, in
                                    response to a request from the President of the United States,
                                    is taking appropriate steps to provide an opportunity to the
                                    American people to contribute in relieving distress among the
                                    civilian population of China. The appeal will be launched on
                                    January 25th and will be nation-wide. Although the President has
                                    expressed the hope that a goodwill offering of perhaps as much
                                    as $1,000,000 will be contributed no one can predict at this
                                    time what the response will be. Consequently great caution
                                    should be exercised by all concerned until actual experience is
                                    gained as to the response to the appeal.</p>
                                <p>It is planned to expend the funds received in this campaign
                                    through reliable and effective agencies which already exist in
                                    China and the Red Cross trusts that the present method of
                                    allotting funds by the American Advisory Committee (not American
                                    Red Cross Advisory Committee) under your guidance can be
                                    continued, with the powers of the Advisory Committee somewhat
                                    widened to permit the allotment of funds to agencies without the
                                    prior approval of the American Red Cross.</p>
                                <p>In handling the funds the financial responsibility of yourself
                                    and the Advisory Committee to the American Red Cross will be
                                    completed upon the receipts of the various agencies for the
                                    funds allocated to them. However, the Committee would doubtless
                                    wish to exercise a reasonable supervision of the activities of
                                    the organizations receiving the funds.</p>
                                <p>In this connection it is suggested that it would be appropriate
                                    to name to the committee a representative of the Protestant
                                    missions, another of the Catholics, and if practicable, someone
                                    to represent the Jewish communities, and any other additions or
                                    changes that seem desirable.</p>
                                <p>Would you please telegraph at the earliest possible moment the
                                    names of the American Advisory Committee for use in connection
                                    with the launching of the appeal. The Red Cross would also
                                    appreciate a 50-word statement from you describing the need,
                                    giving the estimated number of civilian Chinese affected and
                                    also request that a similar statement descriptive of the
                                    Shanghai area be telegraphed by Consul General Gauss.</p>
                                <p>It is also suggested that it would be helpful if you would after

                            (quoted in Radio Bulletin 20 of January 25) and a statement by Admiral
                            Grayson stressing urgency of need, giving information regarding funds
                            already made available for relief in China and stating that no personnel
                            would be sent by American Red Cross nor would purchase be made in the

                        <p>The response to the appeal made by the American Red Cross, pursuant to
                            the letter addressed to the Red Cross by the President on January 17,
                            has been extremely disappointing. The amount sought to be raised is
                            $1,000,000.00 but after ten weeks there have been collected by Red Cross
                            chapters throughout the country only some $111,000.00 or 11% of the
                            amount envisaged.</p>
                        <p>The meagerness of the response is bound to have unfavorable effects both
                            in China and in the United States. In China, public opinion in relation
                            to the traditional friendship and sympathy of the American people for
                            the Chinese people and the general reputation of the United States
                            abroad for generosity will be adversely affected. In this country, the
                            many persons and organizations interested in the question of civilian
                            relief in China are very much worried over the marked lack of response
                            shown to date and are desirous that the Red Cross authorities modify
                            their present procedure—which places almost the entire initiative in
                            regard to the making of contributions upon the would-be-giver—and
                            undertake an active campaign or a “drive” for raising funds for this
                            purpose.</p>
                        <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0579"/>
                        <p>It is clear that unless the appeal for funds is broadened and
                            intensified, it will probably be a failure. The initiative taken by the
                            President on January 17 and the action taken in response thereto have
                            made the matter one of national public interest and concern and, for
                            this reason, if for no other, it is felt that the Red Cross effort
                            should not be permitted to end in failure.</p>
                        <p>The national officers of the Red Cross are having a meeting here in
                            Washington on Monday, April 4. It is believed that it would be
                            exceedingly helpful if a communication from the President could be made
                            to those officers at that time suggesting that the Red Cross effort be
                            expanded and the procedure now in effect be revised with a view to
                            obtaining from the American public a response which will be more in
                            keeping with the circumstances and needs of the situation.<note n="7"

                            behalf of the new “Government”. Doctor Ferguson<note n="10"
                                xml:id="d776fn10">John C. Ferguson, American, adviser to the former

                            proposed that the university be reopened as a joint
                            Sino-American-Japanese institution. He has informed me that he received
                            encouragement from certain members of the Foundation whom he saw in
                            Shanghai recently. They stated, however, that the proposal would have to
                            be referred to members of Foundation in Hankow. It appears that Tang Erh
                            Ho’s proposal contemplates using the returned American indemnity funds
                            either by direct first installment to them if such an arrangement can be
                            made through the customs or by persuading the China Foundation to allot
                            funds for this purpose. I asked Dr. Stuart why Tang Erh Ho expected the
                            Foundation would agree to allotments for <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576"
                                facs="0580"/>the support of Tsinghua under the new conditions and he
                            stated that Tang informed him that if necessary he would dismiss the
                            members of the present Foundation and appoint new members. Tang cited
                            the fact that Chiang Kai Shek<note n="11" xml:id="d776fn11">President of

                            dismissed 5 members of the Foundation out of 10 several years ago and
                            put in Kuomintang members of his choice.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Stuart asked me to inform the Department of the possible turn of
                            events as described above and he stated that he hoped that nothing would
                            be done which would vitiate the original agreement under which the China
                            Foundation has been functioning.<note n="12" xml:id="d776fn12">See

                            for the Department, I felt that the Department would not be disposed,

                            the reorganization and reopening of Tsinghua whether as a joint

                        <p>14. Your 862, December 31, 5 p.m. Although the Department has
                            consistently refrained from interfering with the performance of the
                            legitimate functions of the China Foundation as set forth in its
                            constitution, the Department has effectively objected to the attempted
                            disregard by the Nationalist Government of China of an important
                            provision of the constitution by the arbitrary appointment and dismissal
                            of members of the Board of Trustees. It would, therefore, seem that the
                            Department could not properly ignore any attempted violation of the
                            Foundation’s constitution by an unrecognized regime in China. (See
                            Department’s 114, April 1, 1929, 6 p.m., and previous.)<note n="13"

                            payments already made or to be made to the United States, “the remission
                            of the payments to be for the purpose of further developing the

                        <p>The above-quoted language of the Executive Order raises the question
                            whether the authorization for the remission of the funds permits their
                            use for general educational activities in the interests of China, or
                            restricts their use to scientific educational activities in the sense of
                            the resolution adopted in 1925 by the China Foundation and incorporated
                            in the fourth Whereas clause of the Executive Order.</p>
                        <p>While it would seem that there is ground for support of the more liberal
                            interpretation, due weight must be given in considering any question
                            involving the provisions of the Executive Order of July 16, 1925, to the
                            statements made in all of the Whereas clauses of the Order as well as to
                            the statements contained in the last paragraphs of the Order. As you are
                            aware, it has been the practice of the Department not to intervene,
                            except in cases of absolute need therefor, in matters relating to the
                            functioning of the Board of Trustees of the China Foundation and in this
                            connection note has been taken of the statement contained in your letter
                            that the Foundation has already reached the conclusion that such a grant
                            as is under discussion would lie outside the scope of the program of the
                            Foundation. The ultimate determination of the question which you raise
                            would appear to require consultation by this Department with the
                            Secretary of the Treasury. In view of the foregoing this Department,
                            although it desires to be of all appropriate assistance to you in your
                            consideration of a humanitarian problem, considers that it would be
                            preferable for it to refrain <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0582"

                                    the annual meeting of the Board of Trustees of the China
                                    Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture is to be
                                    held at Kowloon on April 27 and 28, that there are indications
                                    that the Chinese Government through one or more trustees who are
                                    in the Government will make proposals vitally affecting the
                                    status of the Board and the investment of the endowment funds of
                                    the Foundation and of Tsinghua, that one suggestion has been
                                    made that certain members of the Board are <hi rend="italic"
                                        >persona non grata</hi> to the Government and should be
                                    removed from the Board, that this, of course, is contrary to the
                                    constitution of the Board which by presidential mandate issued
                                    previous to the remission is a self-administered Board, that
                                    another and even more urgently pressed suggestion is that the
                                    Board should invest its funds in ‘Government enterprises in the
                                    southwest’ and that such a suggestion if acquiesced in would
                                    completely vitiate the efforts of the Finance Committee to
                                    invest on sound investment lines; that in fact it would not be
                                    investment but unsecured loaning to the Government and for
                                    purposes that might lay the Board open to a charge of using
                                    their funds for promoting Chinese war industries.</p>

                            Standard-Vacuum Oil Company in Hankow, I would like to bring the
                            following matter to the attention of the competent officials of the
                            Chinese Government.</p>
                        <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0584"/>
                        <p>It is the Company’s understanding that the National Control Commission of
                            Liquid Fuels, recently organized at Hankow, was created because it
                            seemed desirable, under the special circumstances arising from present
                            conditions in China, to find means to assure a sufficient supply of oil
                            products at interior points to satisfy legitimate requirements and to
                            provide for the distribution of such products to legitimate consumers,
                            at reasonable prices. In furtherance of its program, the Commission has
                            requested the Company to observe certain restrictions as regards the
                            sale and transportation of the products in question.</p>
                        <p>The Company, having in mind the special circumstances mentioned above, is
                            prepared to comply with this request as far as may be possible, and has
                            requested that the Chinese Government be so informed.</p>
                        <p>The Company wishes to place on record, however, the fact that such
                            compliance is to be without prejudice, and that it is undertaken with
                            the expectation that upon the termination of present abnormal conditions
                            these temporary restrictions upon a free market will be withdrawn.</p>

                        <p>836. Standard Vacuum Oil Company reports Chekiang Provincial Government
                            has set up control board for supervision of importation and distribution
                            of certain merchandise including petroleum products and has organized a
                            company to control the importation and distribution of petroleum
                            products throughout the seventh section area including Haimen, Lukiao,
                            Hwangyen, Linhai and Tientai.</p>
                        <p>Letter further states that for some months the company has been dealing
                            with a control commission set up by the Central Government in Hankow
                            with similar aims, namely control of distribution, prevention of
                            profiteering and prevention of imports from enemy sources. Company’s
                            attitude, already expressed to American Embassy and Hankow control
                            board, is non-agreement to any other measures resulting in restriction
                            of free trade and compliance with restrictive regulations, when
                            unavoidable, only under protest.</p>
                        <p>Letter further states that British petroleum importer[s] have taken same
                            stand in communications to Chinese authorities both direct and <pb
                                n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0585"/>through official channels.
                            While reasons for such measures during hostilities are apparent and
                            while, in some localities, company may be forced to acquiesce, its
                            present chief concern is to maintain as far as possible its trading
                            rights and forestall continuance of control measures after emergency has
                            passed.</p>
                        <p>Letter requests communications of company’s views to Chinese authorities
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>I have written to the Chekiang Provincial Government reviewing rights of

                            This tax will amount to 60 percent of the duty charged by the Customs on

                                noon, Bureau of Finance and Bureau of Police are both attempting to
                                collect automobile license taxes from foreigners resulting in double
                                taxation. There is no guarantee that either bureau will use the fees
                                for road repairs. Controversy between the two municipal bureaus has
                                led to a revision entirely of taxation on foreigners which may bring
                                about one central municipal office charged with collecting taxes
                                from foreigners. Pending adoption of definite tax program by
                                municipal authorities and centralization of tax collection I would
                                respectfully suggest Americans be advised to refrain from making
                                voluntary contributions in payment of vehicle license fees and any
                                new municipal taxes. I am awaiting the Embassy’s instructions before

                            1933 rests primarily on the railway and the Chinese Government,

                            consideration to the question whether representations to the Japanese
                            Government should be made, that the Embassy take up with the appropriate

                        <p>All the messages maintain a tone of optimism. Most put in a word for
                            renewed exertions by the nation, and some forecast 1938 as a year of
                            great importance in the destinies of Japan.</p>
                        <p>Premier Konoe speaks with a sense of impending renaissance, changes in
                            1938 more significant than the Meiji restoration period or the
                            Russo-Japanese war. He says that Japan’s effort is to help China recover
                            from degeneration, and that nothing short of such recovery is vital to
                            Japan’s own security. There is probably a warning of further government
                            control when the Premier states that Japan must more fundamentally
                            mobilize the whole strength of the whole nation for the objectives of
                            the state. In discussing China he holds out an invitation to a new
                            régime. He asserts that responsibility is keenly felt for mishaps to
                            British and American vessels on the occasion of the fall of Nanking.</p>

                            admonishes preparation for protracted war, asserting that the
                            international situation confronts Japan with difficulties in the years
                            ahead.</p>
                        <p>Finance Minister Kaya speaks as if pleased with the results of emergency

                            consumption.</p>
                        <p>The message of Mr. Yuki, the governor of the Bank of Japan, has more to
                            say than Mr. Kaya’s. Although finding the operation of emergency
                            measures satisfactory he points out that more money was put in
                            circulation by the government in 1937 than in 1936, and that in 1938 the
                            sum must be larger still. He admits that absorption of government bonds
                            has not been fully satisfactory, he favors maintenance of the foreign
                            exchange rate, and he anticipates that the coming year, though not one
                            of panic, will be one of recession.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Yoshino, Minister of Commerce and Industry, states that Japanese
                            imports for eleven months through November exceeded exports by
                            ¥650,000,000 and that the adverse balance in 1938 will be worse. He
                            urges economy in consumption while keeping open the importation of
                            essentials, and in general betrays no great concern for the present
                            condition of the country.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Agriculture and Forestry gives himself particularly to
                            exhorting the rural population to continued sacrifices. He is however
                            frank enough to indicate that in rural districts the people are
                            beginning to feel shortages in labor, agricultural machinery,
                            fertilizers, fodder, and oil.</p>
                        <p>New year messages would ordinarily be optimistic rather than otherwise,
                            but even making full allowance for this natural bent it still remains
                            unlikely that the dominant views of the officials of the government are
                            other than those expressed. The nation is confident. Hostilities in
                            China have progressed rapidly and successfully, and the serious economic
                            load necessary therefor has been borne with very little domestic
                            hardship. It is in the country districts that the burden will in all
                            probability fall with the greatest impact, but that effect can be
                            deferred for some time, and has not yet become a pressing problem. Two
                            convictions appear to prevail among the people and among the men in
                            office: first, that Japan is at grips with problems of prime importance
                            in the country’s history; and second, that the nation is equal to the
                            task.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On December 13, 1937, Admiral Nobumasa
                            Suetsugu became Japanese Minister of Home Affairs, succeeding Mr. Baba
                            who had resigned shortly before for reasons of health. Mr. Baba had been
                            one of the strongest leaders in the Konoe cabinet—the individual most
                            relied upon by the Premier, according to a statement made in October by
                            the Premier’s private secretary in personal conversation with a member
                            of my staff—and his resignation with the usual explanation of poor
                            health gave immediate rise to rumors of political intrigue. These rumors
                            were however dispelled a few days later by Mr. Baba’s sudden death from
                            pneumonia.</p>
                        <p>The new Home Minister, Admiral Suetsugu, was born in 1880 and graduated
                            from the Japanese naval academy at the age of nineteen. He has risen
                            rapidly through an active naval career, becoming rear admiral in 1923,
                            commander-in-chief of the combined fleet in 1933, full admiral in 1934,
                            member of the supreme war council in 1935, and, since commencement in
                            July 1937 of the hostilities in China, returning to the more active
                            stage in the office of cabinet councillor.</p>
                        <p>Suetsugu’s appointment to the Home Office shows how far the orientation
                            of Japanese politics veered during the year 1937. Subsequent to the
                            grave national warning embodied in the insurgency of February 26, 1936,
                            it was a conscious and determined aim of Japanese leaders to clear from
                            the ranks of the military services the political machinations which were
                            so seriously threatening military discipline. The composition of every
                            cabinet from that time forward has borne evidence of that aim. The
                            officers named to be the War and the Navy Ministers in each succeeding
                            cabinet were not chosen from the partisans: they have been the ablest,
                            most regular, and politically and factionally most uncommitted men
                            available. This is not to assert, on the other hand, that they have been
                            men opposed to a pre-eminent ascendancy of the military services in the
                            formulation of Japanese policy; but care has been taken that they be not
                            chosen from the groups in the movement out of which developed the
                            political assassinations and attempted coups of the last half-dozen
                            years. Now, with the appointment of Admiral Suetsugu, that principle of
                            avoidance is abandoned. The new Home Minister, though never considered
                            one of the conspirators in any of the various incidents, is definitely
                            of the group standing for a renaissance of Japan under army-navy
                            dominance.</p>

                        <p>In 1928 Suetsugu became vice chief of the naval general staff, and it was
                            from that office that he resigned in protest over Japanese adherence to
                            the London naval treaty.<note n="6" xml:id="d790fn6">Signed April 22,

                            navy took the position that the government misused the prerogative of
                            the Emperor in overriding the opposition and ratifying the treaty, and
                            the cabinet was seriously embarrassed in consequence of the gravity
                            which the question assumed. In this juncture Suetsugu became the
                            spokesman and leader of the big-navy group, and he still enjoys that
                            distinction. Outspoken, confident, direct, severe, chauvinistic,
                            dominating, he has the very qualities which make the select type
                            idealized by the Japanese military mind.</p>

                            one of the idols of the conspirators. Politically ambitious, he was
                            careful, at that time and since, to do nothing to lose the confidence of
                            the young direct-actionist officers. He continues to be looked upon as
                            the high naval officer most approved by the younger politically-minded
                            men in the army and navy. By reason of this following, which is again
                            assuming importance with the progress of the warfare in China, and by
                            reason of Admiral Suetsugu’s recent elevation to the responsible cabinet
                            position of Minister of Home Affairs, particular interest attaches to an
                            interview with him published in the current January issue of the
                            Japanese monthly periodical <hi rend="italic">Kaizo</hi> (enclosure
                                1<note n="8" xml:id="d790fn8">Not printed.</note>). In that
                            publication the interview is dated December 11, two days before Suetsugu
                            became Home Minister.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Kaizo’s</hi> interview ascribes to Admiral Suetsugu
                            the expression of a number of frank views as follows: He asserts that
                            Kiangsu, Anh-wei, Kiangsi, and part of Hupeh will be in Japanese hands,
                            and that the Nanking Government will become a merely local regime if
                            surviving at all. Even Soviet and British aid to China will not avail.
                            The realities in north China call for a new regime. Other local
                            governments will naturally arise elsewhere. All these governments, at
                            one in a common sympathy for Japan, can be expected to unite. The
                            interest of the white peoples in China is an interest in profit in
                            trade; the Japanese interest is more inclusive and can not be guided by
                            the leisurely logic of occidentals. Cooperation of Japan, Manchuria, and
                            China is essential. Whether or not this will mean ejection of the whites
                            from eastern Asia must be a critical issue for the future course of
                            history. World peace is impossible unless the colored races are rescued
                            from their miserable slavery to the white races. To bring the liberation
                            about quickly might mean great bitterness, but the goal is clear. China
                            boasts that it can resist indefinitely; this must mean <pb n="589"
                                xml:id="pg_589" facs="0593"/>counting on British assistance. This
                            evil must be extirpated at the root, even at the cost of a clash between
                            Japan and Great Britain. Japan is strong and will never come to
                            Germany’s fate of defeat by blockade. In event of war between Japan and
                            Britain the United States would surely stay out. Singapore would be
                            difficult to reduce, but Hongkong is vulnerable to submarine and
                            aircraft attack. A Japanese declaration of war on China would be useful
                            in stopping British sale of arms to China. The fall of Nanking is a mere
                            prelude to the most important part of the hostilities; the major
                            fighting is over, but the real war is still ahead.</p>
                        <p>In conversation (enclosure 2, despatch 2738, January 21, 1938<note n="9"
                                xml:id="d790fn9">Neither printed.</note>) on January 7 the British
                            Ambassador informed me of having brought to the attention of the
                            Japanese Foreign Office this anti-British outburst of a man in high
                            Office, pointing out that although the interview was dated two days
                            previous to Admiral Suetsugu’s becoming Home Minister it was not
                            published until several weeks thereafter and could easily have been
                            stopped in the interval. This observation is scarcely pertinent because
                            even at the time of the interview itself Suetsugu was already a cabinet
                            councillor, which amounts to being a cabinet minister without portfolio,
                            and the same limitations upon public expression of views might be
                            expected from such an official. The fact is that the air in Japan is so
                            charged with anti-British sentiment that such expressions from men in
                            office do not seem at all surprising to Japanese; and it can be
                            confidently predicted that the British Ambassador will obtain no
                            satisfaction in the matter.</p>
                        <p>It is common knowledge that Admiral Suetsugu favors a declaration of war
                            against China, chiefly as simplifying Japanese action against the
                            British in China. His arguments have been heard and weighed by the
                            Government, and no war has been declared. But Japanese friction with
                            Great Britain in China is not over. Japan, in the midst of a campaign of
                            conquest, finds herself face to face with British territorial
                            possessions and jurisdictional and political interests in China, all of
                            which stand in the way of the completeness of Japan’s conquest. There is
                            therefore a substantiality to Britain’s interference to Japanese
                            expansion which is not paralleled by American interests in China; and
                            the Japanese attitudes toward the United States and toward Great Britain
                            are not in the same category. There is no indication that relations with
                            Great Britain are destined to improve in the near future. Rather is
                            increasing friction to be expected, particularly growing out of
                            difficulties at Hongkong. If such is the future course Admiral Suetsugu
                            must become a more and more formidable figure in Japanese politics.</p>

                        <p>Admiral Suetsugu’s ascendency is a regression reminiscent of the

                            statesmen, the soldier politicians, are once again in the spotlight.
                            They can not be relegated to the wings in times like the present, when
                            the military services are determined to make a clean sweep of
                            outstanding scores in China. A leader whose bent is strongly and
                            confidently anti-British is that much more in step with the times.
                            Frequent mention of Suetsugu as probable successor to Prime Minister
                            Konoe is not idle chatter. There can be little question that the present
                            conjuncture favors his political future.</p>

                        <p>105. 1. Sensational rumors are current that the parties are so strongly
                            opposed to a bill to “mobilize national resources” which is shortly to
                            be presented to the Diet by the Government that a political crisis of
                            the first order might be precipitated. It is my purpose in presenting
                            the following estimate to be helpful to the Department in weighing
                            despatches on this subject from American correspondents.</p>
                        <p>2. The bill is now being drafted by the National Planning Board and the
                            Bureau of Legislation and its precise terms are, therefore, not known.
                            The Government has, however, been informally explaining the principal
                            features of the measure to members of the Diet and has made it clear
                            that the purpose of the bill is primarily to place under the control of
                            Imperial Headquarters in time of war or of “incidents” virtually all
                            forms of productive industry. Opposition is being expressed by various
                            parliamentary elements to the proposed delegation to the executive of
                            authority to apply such control along with the authority to impose by
                            executive ordinances restrictions in various other ways on the right of
                            private initiative. It is being affirmed that the measure is intended to
                            be a prelude to the introduction of an authoritarian form of
                            government.</p>
                        <p>3. The suggestion has been thrown out that the political parties will
                            make the presentation of the bill an occasion for a definite stand
                            against the increasing control over Government by the army which is
                            reportedly insisting upon the enactment of the bill. There seems to be
                            no doubt but that the scattered remnants of the so-called liberal
                            element are gathering together to defend as far as possible the right
                                <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0595"/>of private initiative. We
                            understand, however, that their opposition is concentrated on the fact
                            that the bill is being drafted with too broad a pen and will provide for
                            the details being filled in by executive ordinances. It is still too
                            early to say whether or not the army will agree to the bill being made
                            more explicit. However, a prominent member of the Diet informed us today
                            that he expected that the bill would eventually be approved after
                            extensive alteration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit herewith
                                clipping<note n="11" xml:id="d792fn11">Not reprinted.</note> from
                            the <hi rend="italic">Japan Advertiser</hi> for February 4, 1938 of an
                            interview with General Araki, which has since been the cause of
                            difficulties and threats.</p>
                        <p>The newspaper account, followed as it was by two explanatory statements
                            printed on different days and by comment in an editorial of a competing
                            paper, caused the Embassy to inquire into the matter, and the following
                            information has been obtained.</p>
                        <p>The original interview was first granted by General Araki to Mr. Frank
                            Hedges, an American newspaper correspondent long resident in Tokyo. Mr.
                            Oland D. Russell, at present a member of the staff of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Japan Advertiser</hi>, asked Mr. Hedges if he could
                            accompany him. This was arranged, and both Mr. Hedges and Mr. Russell
                            attended. Mr. Hedges has continually upheld Mr. Russell’s report of what
                            was said, and there has in fact been no direct questioning of its
                            accuracy. Mr. Russell is an experienced newspaperman who was news editor
                            of the <hi rend="italic">Japan Advertiser</hi> a number of years ago,
                            went to New York where he served until recently as cable editor of the
                                <hi rend="italic">New York World Telegram</hi>, and is now in Tokyo
                            on leave of absence for a few months with a commission from Little,
                            Brown and Company to write a book about the Mitsui family. While
                            temporarily in Tokyo his services are being availed of by the <hi
                                rend="italic">Japan Advertiser</hi> in a part-time capacity.</p>
                        <p>On the part of General Araki the interview itself was arranged largely by
                            a certain Kumasaki, who acted also as the General’s interpreter. Mr.
                            Kumasaki is an experienced linguist, brother of a former officer of the
                            Japanese foreign service, and is often used by government departments at
                            Tokyo in foreign contact work.</p>
                        <p>Among other ideas General Araki put considerable emphasis on the
                            self-sufficiency of Japanese national thought and political philosophy,
                                <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0596"/>and in reference to the
                            Japan–Germany–Italy pact against communism made a good deal of the
                            assertion that Japan’s participation is motivated by the anti-communist
                            usefulness of the pact, not by a spiritual background shared with the
                            fascist state of Europe. The <hi rend="italic">Advertiser</hi> raised
                            this to headlines in the words “Japan’s Link to Fascism Expediency, Says
                            Araki.”</p>
                        <p>The paper immediately received a letter in General Araki’s name admitting
                            that the General’s interpreter might have used the word expediency in
                            the interview, and stating that he in fact had no intention of conveying
                            the meaning of a sacrifice of moral principles to facilitate some end.
                            The following morning, February 5, this letter was printed on the front
                            page, as the interview had been.</p>
                        <p>Later in the day (February 5) the <hi rend="italic">Advertiser</hi>
                            office received a telephone message, purportedly from General Araki’s
                            household, stating that the General would like to see the editor of the
                            paper, Mr. Wilfred Fleisher. It was explained that it would be difficult
                            for the editor to come at that time but that Mr. Russell would be glad
                            to call upon the General. In discussing the time when a conversation
                            could be arranged Mr. Russell suggested a meeting a few days hence, but
                            was told in peremptory manner that it would be to the interest of the
                            paper to comply immediately. A meeting that evening at the Tokyo Club
                            was agreed to. When Mr. Russell appeared with his interpreter at the
                            Tokyo Club at the agreed hour he found a message there directing him to
                            proceed to the General’s house. Arriving at the residence Mr. Russell
                            and his interpreter overheard a heated discussion going on in an
                            adjacent room, at the conclusion of which the General, flanked by two
                            men obviously ruffians, came out to the reception room where Mr. Russell
                            and his interpreter were waiting. The General appeared plainly
                            embarrassed and began in an apologetic manner, whereupon his escorts
                            took matters in their own hands and coming up to Mr. Russell said that
                            things would soon be hard for Mr. Fleisher’s Jew paper and that it might
                            just as well close down now. These remarks were accompanied by some
                            pushing and obvious efforts to give the impression of threatening
                            physical violence. Mr. Russell asked what objections to the paper’s
                            policy he could report to Mr. Fleisher, and the conference got down to
                            its immediate purpose. The General’s two attendants referred to the
                            interview with General Araki as reported in the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Advertiser</hi> of February 4. After hearing their suggestions Mr.
                            Russell drew up a statement (later published on the morning of February
                            7), and this was finally agreed to after a discussion between the
                            General’s men, in which the General was practically overlooked,
                            according to Mr. Russell’s account.</p>
                        <p>Thereupon Mr. Russell mentioned General Araki’s statement, in his letter
                            of February 4 commenting upon the interview as published, <pb n="593"
                                xml:id="pg_593" facs="0597"/>that the General was impressed with the
                            accuracy with which the interview was rendered into English. When this
                            comment by Mr. Russell was translated into Japanese the General’s
                            attendants were infuriated, It was obviously their first information of
                            the letter and they immediately demanded explanations of General Araki.
                            The subsequent discussion seemed to disclose that the letter was the
                            work of Mr. Kumasaki. After some time it was agreed that in spite of the
                            letter the <hi rend="italic">Advertiser</hi> should nevertheless print
                            the statement just drafted by Mr. Russell.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Russell next drew attention to the fact that he had cabled his
                            interview to the United States and that it had already been published.
                            This aspect, to Mr. Russell’s surprise, caused no interest. The men
                            stated that the reaction abroad is a matter of no importance, and
                            pointed to the reaction within Japan as their only interest. Thereupon
                            the conversation ended and the <hi rend="italic">Advertiser</hi> printed
                            the statement agreed to.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Russell’s interpretation of the incident is that it suggests that
                            there are groups in Japan aiming at keeping General Araki’s record clear
                            in order that he may be used as the head of some political movement,
                            probably reactionary, aiming at the displacement of the present
                            political parties by a single organization. The evidence of the Japanese
                            interpreter who accompanied Mr. Russell is that the General’s two
                            attendants were unmistakably of the organized ruffian class which is by
                            all odds the most dangerous to deal with in Japanese life. Even when
                            General Araki was Minister of War he was largely a figurehead for other
                            leaders, and there is plausibility in the estimate that he is still
                            thought of for a similar use again by certain groups having extremely
                            reactionary plans for the solution of Japan’s present difficulties. Such
                            groups would wish him to keep clear of any public statements which might
                            tend to alienate fascist sympathies.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Tokyo public was treated in the latter
                            half of February to a semi-official and much publicized exhibit on the
                            subject of foreign propaganda and intelligence methods, as described in
                            a clipping enclosed herewith.<note n="12" xml:id="d793fn12">Not
                                reprinted.</note> The newspaper account is a fairly accurate
                            description.</p>
                        <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0598"/>
                        <p>The exhibit is one illustration of the many means being currently
                            employed in Japan to sustain support in public opinion for prosecution
                            of the Government’s foreign policy. Its principal theme is that opinion
                            abroad is manufactured, and that where such foreign opinion is
                            anti-Japanese it has been made so by organized effort. There is of
                            course no suggestion that opinion in Japan is amenable to like
                            influences.</p>
                        <p>It is noteworthy that from Germany Japan has now taken over as new motif
                            the campaign against the Jews. In the exhibit the Jews are identified
                            with the Communist International, are described as having effective
                            world-wide organization, and are represented as having sinister power in
                            the control of the news. That this propaganda-stimulus can be thought
                            potentially valuable by Japan, which has no Jewish question, is a
                            provoking reflection on the susceptibilities of the human emotions.</p>
                        <p>The spy mania was deliberately fed by the exhibit. Increasing suspicion
                            toward foreigners and annoyance by would-be patriots is probably to be
                            expected as the wartime psychology grows hereafter.</p>
                        <p>The most disturbing symptom to be observed in this exhibit, as also in
                            the present trend of the press and thought in Japan, is the unqualified
                            acceptance of a world alignment of countries in hostile systems. Japan
                            no longer sees herself as a country working out a solution of problems
                            confined to one part of the earth: more and more the thought is being
                            built up that Japan is party to a world-wide crusade against communism.
                            The pact between Germany, Japan, and Italy is bearing fruit in the field
                            of thought. In 1931 and 1932 the public mind was guided to think of
                            Manchuria as the life-line of Japan; later it was pressed to see that a
                            China not friendly to Japan could not be tolerated. Now the propaganda
                            stage is further expanding.</p>

                            <item>Considerable friction has recently developed between the
                                Government and the political parties. Meetings of the Lower House of
                                the Diet and of committees have frequently been marked by disorders
                                and by violent denunciation of the Government on the charge of
                                attempting to circumscribe personal liberties and private
                                initiative.</item>

                            <item>There have been a series of incidents recently tending to support
                                that charge. A fortnight ago the offices of the political parties
                                were forcibly occupied by members of an anti-communist association
                                which has been demanding the dissolution of the parties and the
                                police failed to afford adequate protection. The leader of the
                                Social Mass Party was physically assaulted a few days ago,
                                presumably by a reactionary. An army officer appearing before a
                                committee of the Lower House to explain the National Mobilization
                                Act improperly harangued the committee and when interrupted ordered
                                a member to “shut up”. These and other incidents along with
                                legislation drafted by the Government pointing toward restriction of
                                private initiative and personal liberties have created widespread
                                suspicion that an element within the Government, headed by Home
                                Minister Suetsugu and covertly encouraged by the Prime Minister, is
                                aiming at bringing about changes along totalitarian lines in the
                                political and social structure of the country.</item>

                            <item>Although the criticism by the political parties of the Home
                                Minister is vehement some of it is theatrical and done for effect.
                                His resignation is being demanded but it remains to be seen whether
                                the Prime Minister who is tied to Suetsugu by obligations of
                                personal friendship will agree to sacrifice him. I am reluctant to
                                make forecasts on Japanese political developments but it seems that
                                the indications are strong that the political parties will not at
                                this time, when the nation is involved in hostilities with China and
                                is externally in a grave position, press the Government to a point
                                where a political crisis of the first magnitude would develop. On
                                the other hand I expect that the Government will make to the parties
                                some gesture of appeasement.</item>

                                followed by a series of conferences with party leaders as a result

                                principal Government bills in the present session, was amended on
                                Monday in the Lower House in a manner clearly unsatisfactory to the

                                party on the basis of the existing groups. A majority of the leaders
                                of the two principal parties, the Minseito and the Seiyukai, appear
                                to have indicated willingness to support their parties’ identity in
                                a single party, realizing that they have but two alternatives:
                                either become a part of the single party or face complete extinction
                                through the creation of an entirely new political grouping sponsored
                                by the Government. Most observers are agreed that Prince Konoe would
                                be favorably inclined to the leadership of the new party despite

                        <p>Although the internal political situation has been outwardly calm ever
                            since the outbreak in July last of the hostilities with China, there
                            have been a number of undercurrents indicating unrest: the political
                            parties have been increasingly conscious of the futility of their
                            opposition to the revival of bureaucracy, business elements have been
                            intensely unhappy over the trend toward governmental control of industry
                            and commerce, and among all classes there exists bewilderment with
                            regard to the failure of Japanese operations in China to unfold more
                            rapidly and successfully than has been the case. In spite of the extreme
                            importance of maintaining national unity, and, further, of maintaining
                            semblances of national unity, and in spite of the absolute power of
                            those in authority to suppress all dissentient elements, the fact is
                            significant that the existence of disunity within the Cabinet, <pb
                                n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0601"/>the supreme directive and
                            administrative agency of the Government, could not be concealed. The
                            purpose of the present despatch is to estimate the significance of that
                            fact.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister is not a bureaucrat, a militarist, a member of any
                            political party, or a businessman. In this lies his strength, for his
                            lack of affiliation with any of these groups has made him acceptable to
                            all classes and groups. With Prince Konoye in the Cabinet are (aside
                            from the Ministers of War and Navy, whose attitudes are always
                            determined by the respective services) the Home Minister, Admiral
                            Suyetsugu, a military firebrand, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry
                            Count Arima, an aristocrat and a close friend of Konoye’s, Minister of
                            Overseas Affairs Count Otani, the head of a noble ecclesiastical family,
                            Education Minister Marquis Kido, a bosom friend of Prince Konoye’s, and
                            a “string” of other ministers, all bureaucrats, some with party
                            affiliations which are no longer important. We find then a cabinet of
                            bureaucrats and friends of the Prime Minister, headed by a man without
                            special obligations to any political faction.</p>
                        <p>The Government as thus constituted, aside from a minor change made last
                            year, has administered the affairs of the nation through nine months of
                            conflict with China. It has laid down as a fundamental policy that it
                            has “ceased to deal with” the Nationalist Government of China. It has
                            succeeded in the recent session of the Diet in securing the passage in
                            substantially the form it desired of a large number of laws, some of
                            them, especially the National Mobilization Law and the Electric Power
                            Control Law, far-reaching in their ultimate effect on the Japanese
                            political and social structure. Notwithstanding these accomplishments,
                            to which should be added a fair measure of military success, doubt and
                            apprehension with regard to future political developments appeared, and
                            at the time of writing have not been entirely removed.</p>
                        <p>The recent Cabinet crisis—for lack of a more precise term—was
                            precipitated by an observation, whether casual or made with calculated
                            effect, by Prince Konoye that because of ill-health and other personal
                            reasons he wished to resign the premiership. There then occurred a
                            scurrying to-and-fro of important political figures—a sure sign in this
                            country that serious political difficulties have arisen. Under banner
                            headlines, the press took notice of the political crisis, but the
                            voluminous discussions of the situation were sheer froth and gave no
                            plausible explanation. It would have been entirely too ingenuous to
                            believe that the situation had arisen over Prince Konoye’s physical
                            condition, which was widely stressed, for the reason that Prince Konoye
                            has not been in robust health for several years. It was being repeatedly
                            affirmed by his friends that Prince Konoye has no political ambitions;
                            and from what we know of his personality and character we are inclined
                            to agree with that statement. If ill-health were a controlling <pb
                                n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0602"/>factor, it would be reasonable
                            to suppose that Prince Konoye would have actually resigned immediately
                            after the session of the Diet, through which the Government carried
                            through its legislative program practically intact, thanks largely to
                            the efforts of Prince Konoye himself. Further, it must be assumed that
                            no one realized more clearly than did Prince Konoye that the situation
                            confronting Japan, both internally and externally, was not one which
                            would allow him to resign for reasons of personal convenience. In the
                            light of these considerations, it was obvious that the controlling
                            factor in the situation was the question whether differences of opinion
                            among those sharing in the execution of fundamental policies could be
                            adjusted.</p>
                        <p>Among certain observers, the view was held that the crisis was caused by
                            the insistence of a certain group within the Cabinet that the National
                            Mobilization Law be immediately invoked. In the light of the formal
                            assurance which the Government gave to the Diet that the law would not
                            be applied during the period of the present hostilities in China, the
                            reports which we had received in confidence from Japanese friends of a
                            virtual cleavage over the carrying out of the China policy seemed to be
                            a more correct estimate of the cause of the crisis. The latter view has
                            been largely borne out by subsequent events.</p>
                        <p>As previously stated, the policy of the Japanese Government is to “cease
                            to deal with the Nationalist Government”. It is obvious that this phrase
                            describes merely the negative aspect of Japan’s policy, the declaration
                            of January 16th<note n="15" xml:id="d796fn15"><ref
                                    target="frus1931-41v01#pg_437"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                        Relations</hi>, Japan, 1931–1941, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                        >i</hi>, p. 437</ref>.</note> in which the phrase occurs
                            being singularly uninformative on the affirmative aspects of policy and
                            on the methods to be employed in their prosecution. It would be to beg
                            the question merely to say that Japan seeks to destroy the Chinese
                            Government by methods of force. There need to be considered such
                            questions as the number of troops to be sent to China, the area of
                            operations, purchase from abroad of supplies, maintenance of national
                            credit, and a thousand and one other questions. Some of these problems
                            fall within the jurisdiction or responsibility of the Government, while
                            others fall entirely within the jurisdiction of Imperial Headquarters.
                            It is to be supposed that the coordination of what might be desirable
                            from a military point of view with diplomatic, financial and economic
                            realities is in itself a fundamental problem. In theory satisfactory
                            liaison between the two agencies is assured by specially appointed
                            officers and, for a period of several months, by frequent meetings
                            between officers of Imperial Headquarters and certain members of the
                            Cabinet who formed an “Inner Cabinet”—the Prime Minister, the Foreign
                            Minister, the War and Navy Ministers and the Minister of Finance.
                            Nevertheless, according to reliable sources, <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599"
                                facs="0603"/>there has been a fundamental difference of opinion
                            between that element of the Cabinet which follows Prince Konoye and
                            Imperial Headquarters over the question of methods which should be used
                            to bring the conflict with China to a successful conclusion.</p>
                        <p>The best information available is that Prince Konoye leads a group,
                            including Mr. Hirota and Marquis Kido, which advocates the urgent need
                            of bringing the conflict to a successful conclusion and whose conception
                            of strategy, both military and political, is that it should be elastic
                            and opportunistic. The War Minister, reflecting the opinion of Imperial
                            Headquarters, is a proponent of the view that pressure steadily exerted
                            on China, by military operations within limited key areas and by
                            economic and financial measures, will eventually bring about the
                            collapse of Chinese resistance. At first glance, such an alignment would
                            seem to be paradoxical; but it is in fact not improbable. There is every
                            reason why the Army, with a powerful potential foe on its right flank,
                            would prefer to husband its resources as much as possible and avoid the
                            risks inherent in dissipating its strength by conducting operations
                            throughout the length and breadth of China. On the other hand, it can be
                            reasonably assumed that Prince Konoye and his supporters are more alive
                            than is the Army to the risks of involvement with Great Britain and the
                            United States, and to the threat to Japan’s material well-being, the
                            longer the conflict continues.</p>
                        <p>Whatever satisfaction Prince Konoye can derive from the basic soundness
                            of his position he cannot blink the fact that, in enjoying thus far the
                            support of the Army, he remains in office only so long as it may please
                            the Army to have him there. Knowing something of Prince Konoye, I am of
                            the opinion that he would not have remained in the intolerable position
                            of acting as a figurehead for the Army and that, notwithstanding a
                            fundamental difference of opinion with the Army as to method, there
                            existed until the crisis developed some common ground. It is interesting
                            to note in retrospect that the Cabinet difficulties first became known
                            immediately after the Japanese military reverse in Southern Shantung. In
                            any event, General Sugiyama, the War Minister, made a literally flying
                            visit to China to inspect conditions at the several fronts, Marquis Kido
                            consulted the Elder Statesman, Prince Saionji, and Prince Konoye duly
                            announced that he would continue in office. There are suggestions in the
                            press that the military operations will be conducted hereafter with
                            greater vigor, and, although no official statement to that effect has
                            been made, an advance on Hankow is believed by many intelligent Japanese
                            to be in preparation. I cannot support my estimate by quotation from
                            authoritative sources, as no person in authority would permit himself to
                            be approached on this subject; but it is my belief, as stated in my
                            telegrams under reference, that there was a serious difference of
                            opinion <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0604"/>among those in control
                            with regard to what should be done by Japan in China and that this
                            difference has been tided over, presumably by the making of a limited
                            concession by the Army to the Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>No useful forecast of future trends can now be made. Excluding the two
                            Service members, the two most forceful individuals in the Cabinet are
                            Marquis Kido, the Minister of Education, and Admiral Suyetsugu, the Home
                            Minister. Marquis Kido is extremely well-informed and a definite
                            realist. He is very close to the Prime Minister and is one of his most
                            trusted and active advisers. Admiral Suyetsugu, on the other hand, is a
                            visionary, and an active advocate of totalitarian doctrine. For Prince
                            Konoye, it is no difficult or unpalatable task to accept Marquis Kido’s
                            advice and maintain a position of independence, while it does not seem
                            to be “in” Prince Konoye to become the mouthpiece of such fanaticism as
                            that with which the name of Suyetsugu has become associated. There are
                            indications that Prince Konoye, in standing out against the Army, has
                            won at least a partial victory and that the Army has “liked it”. I am
                            inclined to the view that the partnership will continue for some
                            time.</p>

                            <item>Consensus of opinion interprets the Cabinet reconstruction as
                                constituting a victory of those elements within the Cabinet, led by
                                the Premier, who have been in favor of pursuing a more forceful
                                policy with regard to the warfare in China over those elements, led
                                by Sugiyama, whose China policy has not been considered sufficiently
                                forceful. <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0605"/>It is surmised
                                that another “February 26 incident” was brewing and that the present
                                reconstruction was delayed only until the victory at Hsuchow
                                permitted a Cabinet crisis to take place without loss of prestige
                                abroad.</item>

                            <item>The complexion of the new Cabinet has obviously been worked out
                                with a view to uniting various heterogeneous elements. Ugaki, a
                                moderate, nevertheless commands the respect of the Army. Ikeda, a
                                sound and conservative financier, enjoys the respect of the business
                                world. Araki as Minister of Education combined with Suetsugu as
                                Minister of the Interior will form a combination satisfactory to the
                                most advanced positivists. The general belief is that Itagaki will
                                shortly succeed Sugiyama, thereby adding strength to the chauvinist
                                camp of the militarists.</item>

                            <item>Another change to be recorded is the relinquishment by Kido of
                                Portfolio of Education to make room for Araki. Kido retains
                                Portfolio of Public Health.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>There is no doubt whatever that these changes reflect a public
                                demand that the so-called China incident be brought to a close as
                                soon as possible by increasingly positive and drastic measures but
                                it is felt at the same time that the appointments of Ugaki and Ikeda
                                will tend to create a stabilizing influence on Japan’s foreign
                                relations.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>An interesting and possibly significant side light on the overturn
                                is that Hirota this afternoon remarked to one of my colleagues that
                                he was on the point of going to the Prime Minister to submit his
                                resignation but that he “did not know what it was all about”.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Ugaki’s personal rank placed him next to Konoye in seniority in
                                the Cabinet and it is reported that he will act as “Vice Premier”.
                                He is moderate with a following in the army which, although small in
                                number, is of substantial influence.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>Ikeda was for several years head of the Mitsui interests and later
                                held office as Governor of the Bank of Japan. Notwithstanding his
                                education in the United States and long association with the
                                business world he is understood latterly to have become sympathetic
                                toward “continental policy”. In any event he has recently received
                                several marks of favor from the army. The belief that he is <hi
                                    rend="italic">persona grata</hi> to the Army is supported by the
                                fact that he will now replace two men who were definitely liberal
                                minded.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>The most definite conclusion to be drawn from today’s
                                reconstruction is that the new Cabinet will be composed of
                                positivists in the prosecution of the hostilities in China. In fact
                                the public announcement of the changes instead of advancing the
                                customary reasons of health states that they were made “to carry on
                                the China incident with even greater vigor”.</item>

                                of the reconstruction of the Cabinet. There is general agreement in
                                the press and in private circles that the Cabinet is now
                                representative of all positivist elements.</item>

                                    <item>Although no specific reference has been made by the press
                                        to the forthcoming resignation of Sugiyama, it is now an
                                        open secret that he is to be replaced, probably by General
                                        Itagaki, although there is minority opinion that some other
                                        officer, perhaps General Koiso, will be appointed. General
                                        Umezu, now Vice Minister of War, is expected to leave office
                                        with his chief and to be replaced by General Tojo, one of
                                        the regional garrison commanders of metropolitan
                                        Japan.</item>

                                    <item>We must correct one detail of our previous estimate. We
                                        had good reason to believe that Hirota was a member of the
                                        positivist group in the Cabinet, and we were therefore
                                        somewhat puzzled over his replacement. We were informed
                                        today by a Japanese diplomat who is very close to the
                                        militarists that Hirota was closely associated with Sugiyama
                                        on the question of prosecution of the China conflict, and
                                        that he was confident until a few days ago that the Sugiyama
                                        bloc in the army would be able to retain control.</item>

                                    <item>There is no warrant for assuming that Ikeda will be the

                                        acknowledged practical business experience. Informed circles
                                        confirm our understanding that he has become affiliated with
                                        those who favor national reconstruction in social and
                                        economic fields. However, according to the press, business
                                        has responded favorably to his appointment.</item>

                                        road on which there is no return. The opinion prevails that
                                        he has paved the way for eventually assuming the

                        <p>635. 1. A high Japanese official has confirmed to us a report that the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon submitted his resignation
                            and is now awaiting decision by the Emperor.</p>
                        <p>2. The Committee of five Cabinet Ministers has been engaged in discussing
                            the proposed organization of the board in which is to be centered
                            direction of relations with and interests in China, and difficulty arose
                            between the Foreign Office and the army over the insistence of the
                            former that the China Board be placed under the effective jurisdiction
                            of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. As censorship has been placed on
                            this matter, further reliable details are difficult to obtain at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>3. A reasonable conjecture is that the action of Ugaki may be a maneuver
                            to obtain the Emperor’s decision in the current controversy between the
                            army and the Foreign Office.</p>

                            <item>With the removal last night of the press censorship some light is
                                now being thrown on yesterday’s developments which were totally
                                unexpected. A detailed account of the discussions of the various
                                plans with regard to the projected China Organ will go forward by
                                    pouch,<note n="17" xml:id="d802fn17"><hi rend="italic"
                                        >Infra</hi>.</note> but briefly stated the army insisted
                                that the China Organ should be an indefinite agency, vested with
                                authority not only to formulate policies vis-à-vis China but
                                virtually to administer all parts of China under Japanese military
                                occupation. Ugaki adopted at the outset the position of the senior
                                officials of the Foreign Office, namely that the creation of an
                                agency with such powers and having existence outside the
                                jurisdiction of the Minister for Foreign Affairs would not only be
                                unconstitutional but would render impossible the conduct of peaceful
                                relations with countries having rights and interests in China. He
                                insisted therefore that the proposed functions of the Organ be
                                radically modified and that the Organ be brought within the
                                organization of the Foreign Office. An official in the Foreign
                                Office informs us that yesterday morning Ugaki, after a protracted
                                discussion with his senior subordinates of a new compromise plan,
                                indicated that he would bring the matter to a head at the conference
                                of five Ministers to be held during the afternoon. It appears that
                                at the conference he expressed flat opposition to the whole project,
                                and then presented his resignation to the Prime Minister.</item>

                            <item>The press this morning roundly condemns Ugaki for divers reasons,
                                but all the papers agree that, following the reorganization of the
                                Cabinet in June, the need for political stability and unity at home
                                transcended all other considerations.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Our provisional comment is that the basic cause for this crisis in
                                the Cabinet is the cleavage of opinion among Japanese leaders,
                                manifested in the resignation of Hirota and General Sugiyama from
                                the Cabinet, over the question of what shall be done with China. The
                                declaration of January 16, that Japan has “ceased to deal with the
                                Nationalist Government”, like Banquo’s ghost continues to harass the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Embassy has had occasion at various
                            times during recent years to invite the Department’s attention to a
                            groping in Japan toward <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0609"/>new and
                            more centralized policy-determining bodies. This trend has paralleled
                            the concurrent movement away from party politics (in even the attenuated
                            form previously existing in Japan) and away from the
                            ordinarily-organized Cabinet as the chief instrument of government. The
                            trend was observable in the establishment of Cabinet counselors, later
                            in the powers placed in Imperial Headquarters, and even more recently in
                            the importance of the five-minister conferences. The present
                            manifestation of the trend is the impending establishment of the Tai Shi
                            In (China Board, or institute with regard to China), to be an organ in
                            which to concentrate direction of Japan’s relations with and interests
                            in China.</p>
                        <p>Prediction has been made in the press that the China Board will be
                            established and commence functioning by the close of October. There has
                            been no authoritative statement of what will be its form or powers, but
                            announcement has been made that about October 8 promulgation of an
                            ordinance with regard to it is likely. It is feared that such
                            promulgation will be too late for inclusion of translation in the pouch
                            by which this despatch is going forward (leaving Yokohama October
                            8).</p>
                        <p>There has nevertheless been some credible discussion in the newspapers of
                            the probable provisions of the forthcoming ordinance. The recent
                            resignation of Foreign Minister Ugaki because of his opposition to the
                            provisions being considered by the Cabinet removes the only obstacle in
                            view, and it now appears even more likely than before that such
                            provisions as are being considered will be put into effect. The
                            newspaper discussion therefore seems of probable dependability.</p>
                        <p>According to the press, the China Board will operate entirely within the
                            structure of the Cabinet. Its director will be the Premier; it will have
                            four vice directors in the persons of the War Minister, the Navy
                            Minister, the Foreign Minister, and the Minister of Finance and of
                            Commerce and Industry. These are the five individuals who have made up
                            the five-minister conferences, that system of war cabinet within the
                            Cabinet which in the last months has become more and more dominant in
                            the country’s governing.</p>
                        <p>Under its director and four vice directors the China Board will have,
                            according to the press, a large technical and administrative staff,
                            defined in the usual Japanese manner by court rank. There will be three
                            bureaus: general affairs, economics, and cultural relations. The chief
                            of each bureau is to be of <hi rend="italic">chokunin</hi> rank. Within
                            the China Board there will be a special deliberative body made up of
                            expert advisers and representatives of important elements of Japanese
                            public opinion. The Board will also have a “contact” committee with some
                            sort of intermediary capacity between the China Board organization on
                            the one hand and on the other hand the five-minister conferences.</p>
                        <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0610"/>
                        <p>Again according to the press, the China Board’s function is not only the
                            direction of policy but also the exercise of actual administrative
                            control in the field. Branches will be established in the occupied areas
                            of China at a number of points: Peiping, Kalgan, and Shanghai have been
                            mentioned. The press anticipates that the Board is to function only for
                            the duration of the hostilities.</p>
                        <p>It would appear that the conferences of the five ministers are to
                            continue to be the centralized policy-determining authority for problems
                            and interests in China, and that the new China Board is an effort to
                            create an organization to make more effective the control exercised by
                            the five-minister conferences. The development is in part an empirical
                            consequence of the relative success of those conferences in the last
                            months; it is a crystalization of a process of concentrating of
                            authority which has been going forward with the hostilities. But at this
                            point it is necessary to temper the observation that the China Board is
                            another step in the direction of concentration of power by again
                            observing that it is expected to be a body within the structure of the
                            Cabinet. Japanese leaders who foresee danger in possible assumption of
                            exclusive political control by the military appear to derive
                            satisfaction from the fact that the movement to establish the new body
                            has been guided into the direction of subordination to the Cabinet
                            rather than, for example, into the direction of subordination to
                            Imperial Headquarters. It is probable that Premier Konoe sees as his
                            most responsible task, at this juncture of Japan’s history, the
                            prevention of complete political control of the country by the military.
                            This is not to assert that Prince Konoe is antagonistic to the
                            objectives of the military class—on the contrary, there is ample
                            evidence that he shares the same strongly nationalistic views and high
                            belief in an expanding national destiny; but at the same time candid
                            observation of his methods leaves room for doubt that he sees hope in
                            abandoning the nation to leadership by the military themselves. It would
                            seem to be a safe assumption that Prince Konoe considers the China Board
                            a triumph of his efforts at moderating the pace of political change in
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>If the establishment of the China Board leads to better enforcement in
                            the field of instructions issuing from Tokyo, it is not all loss from
                            the point of view of the interests of the United States. The Department
                            needs no reminding of the many instances in which gratifying assurances
                            accorded our representations in Tokyo have failed of execution by the
                            Japanese authorities in China. It is undoubtedly part of the hope back
                            of the establishment of the China Board that it will mean stricter
                            coordination. In my conversation with the <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607"

                            specifically of the China Board as being aimed at increasing direct

                        <p>But even the most hopeful interpretation of this newest development can
                            not conceal the great dangers which inhere in it for the future. China
                            is overwhelmingly Japan’s most important problem. It is not difficult to
                            foresee a sweeping effect on other already-operating branches of the
                            Japanese government by reason of the establishing of a new governmental
                            body, highly led, appropriating to itself all matters having to do with
                            China. It is furthermore a matter of apprehension that this change may
                            survive as a workable instrument of centralized control, but may lose
                            its present dominantly civilian direction.</p>

                            entitled “Mobilization in Japan”, prepared by Mr. Max W. Schmidt, Third
                            Secretary of the Embassy.</p>
                        <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0612"/>
                        <p>The memorandum deals with a movement now in process the importance of
                            which is daily becoming more manifest. The word mobilization has been
                            used in relation to this movement only for lack of a term which would be
                            concisely descriptive of conscious effort, under the control of a
                            central directorate, to rationalize and integrate all aspects of
                            national activity. All nations, including even those which firmly rest
                            on democratic principles, are today alive to the impossibility of
                            conducting a major war without coordination of national resources, and
                            as brought out in the memorandum, practically every nation has today
                            some plan for coordinating its industrial, economic and financial
                            resources to be put into effect in the event of war. The plan now being
                            put into effect by Japan, however, is not intended to be merely for the
                            duration of the hostilities with China: it is being instituted at this
                            time for the reason that Japan, perhaps more than any other important
                            Power, would be unable to conduct a major war without drastic
                            coordination and control of resources; but the trend toward national
                            mobilization had set in before the hostilities began. The memorandum
                            makes entirely clear the ultimate objectives of those promoting and
                            developing this movement, and if they are to have their way—and no
                            competent observer will hazard the definite prediction that they will
                            not—a change out of all recognition of the economic and industrial
                            systems may be expected. Indications of an alteration in fact in the
                            political structure are also present: the political parties are
                            completely impotent and there is much talk—and much confusion—about the
                            setting up of a national party.</p>
                        <p>These far-reaching changes have naturally given rise to the definite
                            conclusion, especially abroad, that Japan is evolving into a
                            totalitarian state. There is nowadays a too-common habit of placing
                            political movements into carefully divided categories and of attaching
                            to each movement some familiar and currently used designation. As
                            drastic as are the changes to be carried out under national
                            mobilization, we do not believe that there will emerge a state which in
                            its superficial aspects and in many of its functional aspects, will be
                            on all fours with Germany and Italy. It is unlikely that the national
                            polity will be altered or that there will be material revision of the
                            organic laws of the several branches of the Government. Nor do we think
                            it likely that a personal dictatorship would be tolerated. We envisage
                            rather a retention and strengthening of the Emperor cult, and
                            unification of the various elements which now rule the country, perhaps
                            eventually taking form in an organization by which the masses and all
                            forms of national activity will be regimented, coordinated and
                            integrated. What is evolving is totalitarianism, if one insists on using
                            that term, but it will be totalitarianism <hi rend="italic">sui
                                generis</hi>.</p>
                        <p>I have complimented Mr. Schmidt on this memorandum, which is based
                            largely on source material, there being available nothing on the <pb
                                n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0613"/>subject in any foreign language
                            and surprisingly little by way of interpretation and commentary in
                            Japanese. By dint of application and industry Mr. Schmidt has laid down
                            the basis of further and continued study of an important movement the
                            end of which is not in view.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my despatch No. 3380,
                            November 1, 1938, and as another step in the direction of national
                            solidarity and mobilization in Japan under the Government’s auspices, I
                            have the honor to report that the movement, which began with attempts to
                            form a new “national party”, toward the creation of a new national
                            organization has reached a definite climax with the announcement by the
                            Cabinet of an outline for a national organization embracing
                            representation in every existing public organization in village, town,
                            city and prefecture.</p>
                        <p>The present political parties had resisted strongly the attempts to form
                            a new political party. They advanced the argument that such a party was
                            entirely unnecessary because present parties were cooperating to the
                            fullest extent with the Government. To make this fact even more obvious,
                            leaders of the Seiyukai and the Minseito announced in October and
                            actually launched about the middle of November a series of mass meetings
                            throughout the country. These assemblies were for the purpose of
                            explaining the parties’ recently established “National League for the
                            Reconstruction of East Asia” and of bolstering the spiritual
                            mobilization of the people to give greater support to Japan’s “immutable
                            policy”. The first meeting on November 15, 1938, at the Hibiya Public
                            hall in Tokyo was highly successful.</p>
                        <p>It was announced in the press on November 17 that Premier Konoe was to
                            discuss with political leaders of the parties his plan for the
                            “reorganization of the nation”. At the same time, the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Asahi</hi> reported that Prince Konoe had said that this movement
                            must be of a broader scope than merely that of a national party, that it
                            is essential for the disposition of the China incident and the building
                            of a new order in East Asia, and that he had ordered Count Arima,
                            Minister for Agriculture and Forestry, and Mr. Akira Kazami, chief
                            secretary of the Cabinet, to consult other members of the Cabinet and to
                            prepare a <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0614"/>draft plan of
                            organization. Subsequent developments followed the usual pattern of
                            negotiations within the Cabinet.</p>
                        <p>On November 24 the <hi rend="italic">Kokumin</hi> newspaper reported that
                            the movement was showing no progress owing in the first place to “an
                            uncertainty concerning the reaction in financial circles and an
                            inadequate appreciation of the movement within the Cabinet”, emphasis
                            being placed on the “indifference” to the movement in financial circles.
                            It was stated that Premier Konoe was determined to launch the program
                            but that he would not act until a “concrete plan is ready”.</p>
                        <p>The next step was an announcement that the new program was to be an
                            enlargement and reorganization of the Central League for Spiritual
                            Mobilization which, it was said, has long been criticized for its
                            inactivity and ineffectiveness.</p>
                        <p>On December 1 the <hi rend="italic">Yomiuri</hi> published the outline of
                            the organization of the new “National Council” (Kokumin Kyoji Kai). In
                            this article the purpose is stated to be the “revitalizing of national
                            solidarity and the promoting of a new order in East Asia by the uniting
                            of every aspect of national power”. Every organized body in the nation
                            is to join. Premier Konoe is to be president of the National Council,
                            and Home Minister Suetsugu and Education Minister Araki, vice
                            presidents. The presiding chairman has not been decided upon. A board of
                            directors, with representatives from all influential organizations, is
                            to be set up as the executive organ. This board is to be subdivided
                            according to cities, villages, etc. The local governor, mayor or head
                            man will be the chief of the subdivision in his own district. A central
                            bureau is to be organized for administrative work under the Board of
                            Directors. A board of trustees is to be established as a consultative,
                            deliberative body and will have representatives from all participating
                            organizations. In addition there are to be formed prefectural branches
                            under the local Governor. The organization in Prefectures, cities,
                            villages, etc. will be built up on the pattern of the central
                            organization.</p>
                        <p>First reaction in the newspapers has been on the whole unfavorable. They
                            criticize the frequent changes made by the Government in its spiritual
                            mobilization plans, suggest that the possible relation of this new
                            organization with the Imperial Diet may be unconstitutional, and add
                            that the fact that it is not clear whether this movement is actually a
                            national party in disguise or an expansion of the Central League for
                            Spiritual Mobilization lends to confusion and thereby defeats the
                            purpose in view. The <hi rend="italic">Nichi Nichi</hi> states that the
                            movement is still dominated by the “spirit of the old organization”
                            which failed.</p>
                        <p>An article appearing in the <hi rend="italic">Japan Advertiser</hi>
                            outlining the projected plan is enclosed.<note n="22" xml:id="d806fn22"

                        <p>There is but one comment which can, and needs to be, made at this time.
                            It is apparent that the Prime Minister favors in principle the
                            establishment of a national party such as the Fascist Party in Italy, or
                            the National Socialist Party in Germany, but that he feels that the
                            nation is not as yet ready. It is clear that this national
                            reorganization movement is intended first to integrate the people
                            politically, and that when that objective shall have been accomplished
                            there is to be a conversion of the organization so formed into a
                            national party.</p>

                        <p>813. 1. There has recently been much activity among politically important
                            persons and a keying up of the political atmosphere which is perceptible
                            even if the causes are not definitely known. Various rumors therefore
                            are now current: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that the Prime Minister is
                            about to resign and is to be replaced by General Minami (Governor
                            General of Korea) or Baron Hiranuma (president of the Privy Council) or
                            Marquis Kido (Minister of Public Welfare); (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                            that the Cabinet is about to be reorganized by limiting membership to
                            the heads of those departments directly concerned with high national
                            policy and perhaps by some change of personnel; (<hi rend="italic"
                                >c</hi>) that the Japanese Government is now in touch with Wang
                            Ching Wei<note n="23" xml:id="d807fn23">Chinese deputy leader of the

                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>2. The New Year holidays have already started and most of our reliable
                            Japanese contacts are out of town. However, such inquiries as we have
                            made brought out the opinion that it would be impossible for Konoye
                            consistently with the sense of responsibility expected in this country
                            of persons occupying a high public office to resign at this time. We are
                            impressed by the fact that the Diet has just met for several days in a
                            preliminary session and that the currency of rumors at this time of the
                            year is seasonal. In the absence of reliable indications we are inclined
                            to believe that rumors (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) and (<hi rend="italic"
                                >c</hi>) above are being served out by those who find rumor (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) which contains some substantial element of
                            probability too prosaic an explanation of actual symptoms of an
                            impending political event.</p>

                        <p>110. Department’s 53, February 11, 6 p.m.</p>
                        <p>1. On February 12, 1937, there was promulgated a law providing for five
                            new taxes the proceeds of which were to be deposited in the “North China
                            special account”. On September 10 there was created by law No. 85 the
                            “temporary military expenditures account” which is stipulated by the law
                            to be an account independent of and distinct from the “general account”
                            of the Japanese Government. This latter law further provides that on all
                            expenditures connected with the “North China Incident” (which has
                            previously been disbursed from the general account) are to be paid from
                            the above special account and that certain specific revenues including
                            the taxes above referred to are to be paid into such special account. It
                            seems clear from the foregoing that the proceeds of these taxes are not
                            being paid into the general exchequer for meeting the normal and general
                            expenditures of the Japanese Government but that they are on the
                            contrary being earmarked and expended solely for military purposes.</p>
                        <p>2. We understand that certain American residents have been called upon to
                            pay one or two of the special taxes which have a direct incidence but so
                            far as we know none of them has paid.</p>
                        <p>3. It is our view that the special taxes above referred to and other
                            similar taxes now before the Diet are for the special and sole purpose
                            of financing military operations in China and that exemptions should be
                            claimed in respect of American citizens on the basis of treaty
                            provisions.</p>
                        <p>4. We suggest that we be authorized as a first step to make oral
                            representations to the Foreign Office including the leaving of an <hi

                            conclusions above outlined and would conclude with a paragraph
                            substantially as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It seems beyond assault of doubt or cavil that the taxes under

                                    concurrence in the view that the taxes under reference are not
                                    applicable to citizens, whether private or corporate, of the
                                    United States, and invites an assurance that measures which have
                                    been taken to collect such taxes from citizens of the United
                                    States will be discontinued.”</p>

                                    regard to the application to American citizens resident in Japan
                                    of the North China Incident special income tax and of other
                                    taxes which may be set up in the future for the purpose of
                                    securing funds for military purposes of the Empire in China, and
                                    to present a reply, as follows:</p>
                                <p>Law number 85 (extraordinary military expenditures special
                                    account law) of 1937 provides, in article 2 thereof that
                                    ‘expenditures under the War and Navy Departments for the North
                                    China Incident, the first reserve fund for expenditures under
                                    the Finance Department for the North China Incident, and
                                    revenues to be applied to such expenditures are to be
                                    transferred to this account (denned by article 1 of this law)
                                    and adjusted’. However, the premise exists that the revenues of
                                    this special account essentially belong to the general account
                                    and have the character of general sources of revenue; the
                                    foregoing method of accounting has been employed wholly for
                                    reasons of convenience in adjusting the accounts, and the
                                    character of the special taxes has thereby in no sense been
                                    changed. Law number 66 (North China Incident special taxes) of
                                    1937 does not in any way specify the purposes to which the taxes
                                    are to be applied, and until the above mentioned special account
                                    law became effective all the revenues from the special taxes
                                    under reference were paid into the general account, as is also
                                    to be done with all revenues accruing from the China Incident
                                    special tax law, which is to become effective from the coming
                                    fiscal year. Accordingly, the question of what method is used to
                                    account for such revenues is a matter to be decided entirely
                                    from the standpoint of convenience in adjusting the accounts of
                                    the Government. Further, the revenues from the special taxes
                                    under reference are appropriated, <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615"

                                    non-military purposes, to meet the general expenditures, and the
                                    Imperial Government, therefore, regrets that it cannot assent to
                                    the American view that the provisions of the various laws cited
                                    prove that the incomes derived from the special taxes under
                                    reference are not paid into the exchequer and that they are
                                    reserved and expended entirety for military purposes.</p>
                                <p>It is also desired to draw the attention of the American Embassy
                                    to the fact that, with reference to the term ‘military exactions
                                    or contributions’ found at the conclusion of the fourth
                                    paragraph article I of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of
                                    1911, the Imperial Government believes that it is proper to
                                    define that term as meaning military requisitions or military
                                    contributions or other urgent and extraordinary levies made in
                                    unavoidable circumstances. In other words, that term involves
                                    the principle of assessment and requisition by the military
                                    authorities, and even if not so assessed and requisitioned the
                                    term in its strict sense would apply only to those things
                                    supplied to the military forces. The North China Incident
                                    special taxes, after enactment by normal legislative procedure,
                                    are assessed and collected uniformly within the country by the
                                    normal taxation agencies, and are not applied solely for
                                    military purposes in the precise meaning of the term.
                                    Accordingly, the Japanese Government maintains the view that
                                    American citizens resident in Japan cannot escape from the
                                    obligation imposed on them by the second paragraph of article II
                                    of the above mentioned Treaty to pay taxes equally with Japanese
                                    subjects.</p>
                                <p>With regard to law number 3 (extraordinary special tax) of 1906
                                        [<hi rend="italic">1904</hi>], a question similar to the
                                    present question arose at the time of the Russo-Japanese war
                                    with foreign nationals residing in Japan, and the Imperial
                                    Government then took precisely the same position with regard to
                                    the various treaties of commerce and navigation that it takes in
                                    the present case. Despite the fact that the then current

                                    between the United States and Japan, the British Government
                                    concurred in the view that such provision was inapplicable to
                                    the extraordinary special tax and that there was no warrant for
                                    British [nationals] residing in Japan claiming exemption from
                                    such extraordinary special tax.</p>
                                <p>The Imperial Government accordingly regrets that it cannot comply
                                    with the request of the American Embassy for assurance that

                                    <item>Our contention that the taxes are inapplicable to American
                                        citizens does not rest on the fact that the proceeds are to
                                        be paid into a special fund set up for meeting military
                                        expenditures but on the fact that the revenues are to be
                                        applied to military expenditures. The reference in our
                                        representations to the special fund was designed to
                                        establish that fact.</item>

                                    <item>The hostilities with China created the need for the
                                        additional revenues now being provided by these

                                    <item>There is no basis for the Japanese contention that as the
                                        taxes were created by normal legislative processes and
                                        assessed and collected by the regularly established agencies
                                        of the Government they cannot be regarded as military
                                        exactions or contributions. If such interpretation were
                                        valid, the provision of the relevant treaty provision which
                                        was obviously intended to be a safeguard against levies for
                                        military purposes could be readily circumvented.</item>

                            <item>The British Ambassador is about to make representations similar to
                                ours. I understand that he will call attention to the exemption
                                enjoyed by Japanese residents in Great Britain from taxes the
                                revenues of which are being applied to the British rearmament
                                program. Comment along the following lines might be added:</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The American Government firmly believes in the justice of the assertion
                            that the taxes are not applicable to American citizens and its position
                            is not in any way susceptible of alteration by the statement of the
                            Japanese Government that the British Government in a previous instance
                            took a different position. As the Japanese Government however appears to
                            believe that the views of the British Government <pb n="617"
                                xml:id="pg_617" facs="0621"/>afford grounds for the contention that
                            American citizens are liable to these taxes, the Japanese Government
                            will no doubt be disposed to withdraw that contention in the light of
                            the fact that the views of the British Government in the instant case
                            coincide with those of the American Government in taking exception to
                            the application of the taxes to their respective nationals.</p>

                                indicated in the first paragraph of the Department’s No. 53,
                                February 11, 6 p.m., that it is the view of this Government that any

                            11, 1938, with which you enclosed a copy of a letter dated March 9,
                            1938, from the Textile Export Association of the United States, New
                            York, New York.<note n="32" xml:id="d817fn32">Neither printed.</note>
                            The Association stated that it believes that the Japanese cotton textile
                            exporters will not consent to a renewal of the existing agreement
                            restricting Japanese cotton textile exports to the Philippines when that
                            agreement, as renewed last year, expires on July 31, 1938; that it has
                            reason to believe that the Philippine Assembly is prepared to approve at
                            any time alterations in the Philippine tariff which would provide added
                            protection to American textiles and would render unnecessary the renewal
                            of the agreement with the Japanese cotton textile exporters; and that
                            action, if any, along these lines should be taken immediately, as the
                            Philippine Assembly will be in session for only a few weeks more. The
                            Association therefore requested that you secure from the authorities in
                            Washington the assurance that if the Philippine Assembly should pass
                            such a measure it would not be opposed in Washington. You requested the
                            views of the Department of State in regard to this matter and an
                            indication of the reply which you should make to the Association.</p>
                        <p>The agreement between this Government and the Japanese cotton textile
                            exporters has been operating satisfactorily since the Japanese exporters
                            voluntarily prohibited the exportation to Hong Kong of those varieties
                            of cotton textiles which previously had been transshipped to the
                            Philippines. This is shown by the following statistics of arrivals of
                            cotton piece goods in the Philippines (except the port of Jolo) during
                            the past four months, as supplied by the United States Trade

                        <p>As is indicated by the above statistics, exporters of American cotton
                            textiles, at the present rate of shipment, are handling about sixty
                            percent of the combined Japanese and American trade, whereas, in the
                            negotiation of the agreement, a fairly equal division of the market
                            between American and Japanese manufacturers of cotton textiles was
                            contemplated (cotton textiles other than American or Japanese occupied
                            less than five percent of the market). From a practical viewpoint,
                            therefore, there would appear to be no objection at the present time on
                            the part of the American exporters to the continuation of the agreement
                            until such time as it may be possible to make other arrangements for
                            control of the trade. The Department of State, moreover, is not aware of
                            any reason why the Japanese cotton textile exporters should not desire
                            to renew the agreement for another year. In 1937, the Japanese entered
                            willingly into the renewal of the agreement, and their rigid enforcement
                            of the terms of the agreement (as is shown by their voluntary control of
                            their shipments to Hong Kong) indicates their desire for a continuance
                            of the agreement. This Department, however, will explore the matter of
                            the Japanese desires in this connection before taking a definite
                            position either in regard to the extension of the present agreement or
                            in regard to some other method of control of the trade.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, it should be understood that the Government of the
                            United States, by the terms of the understanding forming the basis for
                            the agreement, is precluded from taking any action calculated to
                            persuade the Philippine Government to increase its duties on cotton
                            piece goods, to take effect prior to August 1, 1938, so long as the
                            imports into the Philippines of Japanese cotton piece goods do not
                            exceed 45,000,000 square meters annually. Unless and Until, therefore,
                            the Philippine imports of Japanese cotton textiles exceed 45,000,000
                            square meters in the year beginning August 1, 1937, the Government of
                            the United States would not be in a position to indicate to the
                            Philippine Government its acceptance of any such increase in the tariff
                            on cotton piece goods.</p>
                        <p>The above explanation of the situation is for your confidential
                            information. In your reply to the Association, it is suggested that you
                            point out that, in accordance with the terms of our understanding with
                            the Japanese textile exporters, this Government will not be in a
                            position to indicate its acceptance of any tariff increase, effective
                            prior to August 1, 1938, on cotton piece goods unless the imports of
                            Japanese cotton textiles into the Philippines exceed 45,000,000 square
                            meters for the year beginning August 1, 1937; that the Department of
                            State has not taken a definite position either in regard to the
                            extension of the present agreement or in regard to any other method <pb
                                n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0625"/>of control which would afford
                            American exporters of cotton textiles a fair share in the Philippine
                            market; that the Department of State is reluctant to take a position in
                            this matter until it has had an opportunity to consider the
                            recommendations which the Joint Preparatory Committee on Philippine
                            Affairs will make in regard to the Philippine imports of cotton
                            textiles; and that, in any event, it is believed that there is ample
                            time before the expiration of the agreement to give consideration to the
                            question of renewing the agreement or adopting some other method of
                            control.</p>

                            Suma was reminded that the quota of forty-five million square meters in
                            the original agreement had been fixed in the mutual expectation that
                            this would divide the Philippine market equally between Japan and the
                            United States and it was pointed out that as the total importation of
                            cotton piece goods into the Philippine Islands had not subsequently
                            increased, we could find no basis for the request of the Japanese
                            Association that the quota be increased over the present figure. With
                            reference to the desire expressed by Mr. Suma that the arrangement be
                            renewed for a period of two years, it was explained that this Government
                            did not desire to commit itself for a longer period than one year in
                            view of a possibility of action being taken during the coming year to
                            affect <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0626"/>adjustments in the
                            existing trade relations between the United States and the Philippines.
                            Mr. Suma was also told that we would like to have included in the text
                            of our proposal covering the renewal of the arrangement a statement to
                            the effect that if the quantity of Japanese cotton piece goods imported
                            into the Philippine Islands reached a figure of forty-five million
                            square meters prior to the expiration of the arrangement, the Government
                            of the United States would be released from its commitment with regard
                            to the Philippine import duties on cotton textiles.</p>
                        <p>After some discussion Mr. Suma agreed to refer to his Government our
                            proposals. He and Mr. Sakamoto appeared to appreciate our explanation of
                            the reasons why we would be unwilling to extend the arrangement for a
                            period longer than one year or to assent to an increase in the Japanese
                            quota. On the other hand, they raised objections on point three. They
                            observed that our right to release ourselves from our commitments in the
                            event that the Japanese found themselves unable to keep their exports
                            within the quota was implicit in the arrangement from the first and saw
                            no necessity for the inclusion of an explicit statement to that effect
                            in the new arrangement. Their specific objections to the inclusion of
                            such an explicit statement were (1) that the arrangement would lose its
                            character as a “gentlemen’s agreement” and become a legal agreement
                            which would have to be submitted by the Foreign Office to the Privy
                            Council and (2) that it would be viewed by the Japanese as a reflection
                            on their good faith.</p>
                        <p>It was explained to Mr. Suma that there was no question whatsoever in our
                            minds of questioning their good faith in suggesting the inclusion of
                            such a clause, but it was thought that it would merely serve to be
                            helpful in clarifying a point which we agreed was implicit in the
                            arrangement. It was finally decided to leave this latter point open for
                            further discussion, and in the meantime Mr. Ballantine offered to sound
                            out the views of this Government as to whether an oral statement by us
                            to Mr. Suma to be assented to by him to the effect that our right to be
                            released from our commitment in the event that the Japanese exceeded the
                            quota prior to the expiration of the arrangement was implicit in the
                            arrangement would be an acceptable substitute to an explicit statement
                            to that effect in our written proposal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Suma and Mr. Sakamoto said that the Japanese Embassy would report our
                            proposal to the Japanese Government and would expect to communicate with
                            Mr. Ballantine immediately upon receipt of further instructions from
                            their Government.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Suma referred to his conversation with Mr. Ballantine on June 8 in
                            regard to the question of the renewal of the Philippine Cotton Textile
                            Arrangement and said that a telegram had now been received stating that
                            the Japanese Association of Exporters was willing to extend the
                            arrangement for a period of one year and would accept the present quota
                            of 45,000,000 square meters provided that the written instrument of
                            renewal contained no explicit clause, such as had been suggested, that
                            it was understood that if the amount of Japan’s exports exceeded the
                            quota agreed upon prior to the expiration of the term of the agreement
                            the Government of the United States would be released from its
                            obligations under the arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ballantine said that he would inform the interested officers of the
                            Department of Mr. Suma’s message and it was arranged that Mr. Ballantine
                            would endeavor to consult with his associates on drafts of notes to be
                            exchanged in connection with the proposed extension of the arrangement
                            and that as soon as such drafts were prepared we should expect to seek a
                            further discussion with Mr. Suma.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Sayre, in outlining to Mr. Suma the attitude of our Government toward
                            the question of renewal of the existing agreement relating to the
                            importation of Japanese cotton piece goods into the Philippines, said
                            that we were now confronted with the possibility of going before
                            Congress during its forthcoming session in connection with
                            recommendations for legislation to carry out the recommendations of the
                            Joint Preparatory Committee. Accordingly, while this Government <pb
                                n="624" xml:id="pg_624" facs="0628"/>would like to renew the
                            existing agreement for an additional period of one year, we had felt
                            that it would be desirable to have renewal take a form somewhat
                            different from that in which it was renewed last year. Mr. Sayre handed
                            Mr. Suma a draft of a proposed note from the Department to the Japanese
                            Embassy and a draft of an acknowledgment by the Japanese Embassy
                            thereto. Mr. Sayre explained that this form of renewal took into account
                            the difference in the positions of the two Governments with regard to
                            the question of transshipments, our Government having contended from the
                            first that the quota included transshipments through intermediate ports,
                            whereas the Japanese Government notwithstanding its understanding of our
                            position had indicated that it could not publicly acknowledge that the
                            quota included transshipments. Mr. Sayre also explained that the only
                            other essential feature in which the new proposed form differed from the
                            old was the division of the quota into four quarterly periods which had
                            been designed with a view to avoiding possible embarrassment should the
                            Department have occasion to go before Congress in regard to the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Suma expressed his first-hand reaction that the present proposal
                            would be regarded by the Japanese exporters as denoting suspicion on our
                            part of Japan’s good faith in this matter. Mr. Sayre and Mr. Ballantine
                            then went over the ground again with Mr. Suma to make clear that the
                            suggested form of renewal had not been prompted by any suspicion of
                            Japan’s good faith, and Mr. Suma was apparently satisfied with our
                            explanation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sayre then requested that Mr. Suma refer the two drafts to the
                            Japanese Government and made it quite clear that if the Japanese
                            Government wished to offer any counter-suggestions or changes we would
                            be quite prepared to consider them. He said that we had no wish to close
                            any doors. Mr. Suma said that he would refer the two drafts to his
                            Government and would expect a reply at an early date.<note n="36"

                            31, 1938, the United States Government wishes to declare to the Japanese
                            Embassy, for communication to the Japanese Government and to the
                            Association of Japanese Exporters of Cotton Piece Goods into the
                            Philippines, its policy for a further period of one year from August 1,
                            1938 through July 31, 1939, in regard to the imports into the
                            Philippines of Japanese cotton piece goods, to-wit:</p>
                        <p>So long as the imports into the Philippines of Japanese cotton piece
                            goods do not exceed 11,250,000 square meters in any quarter, the United
                            States Government will take no action directed toward securing an
                            increase in Philippine tariff rates on cotton piece goods to become
                            effective prior to August 1, 1939. If imports in any quarter should
                            amount to less than or more than 11,250,000 square meters, the
                            deficiency shall be added to or the excess subtracted from the allowance
                            for any succeeding quarter or quarters, providing that such excess of
                            imports as may be brought into the Philippines within any quarter shall
                            never be more than 2,250,000 square meters (this being twenty percent of
                            the normal quarterly quota allowance).</p>

                        <p>With reference to the memorandum of the Department of State, dated July
                            22, 1938, declaring the policy of the United States Government for the
                            period August 1, 1938 through July 31, 1939, in regard to the
                            importation into the Philippines of Japanese cotton piece goods, the
                            Japanese Embassy is now instructed to inform the Government of the
                            United States as follows:</p>
                        <p>The Association of Japanese Exporters of Cotton Piece Goods declares that
                            it will, during the period of one year from August 1, 1938 through July
                            31, 1939, limit the imports of Japanese cotton piece goods into the
                            Philippines within the quantitative limitations set forth in the
                            memorandum of the Department of State dated July 22, 1938, and will
                            continue its voluntary efforts to make its restrictions upon shipments
                            via intermediary ports as effective as they were during the period from
                            August 1, 1937, to the date of this memorandum.</p>

                            Philippine cotton textile agreement for one year from August 1, 1938,
                            having been effected,<note n="40" xml:id="d823fn40"><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Supra</hi>.</note> the texts of the documents exchanged were
                            compared with the texts of the drafts originally agreed upon. In handing
                            Mr. Suma the Department’s note, Mr. Sayre observed that our Government
                            had at the instance of the Japanese Government agreed to the omission of
                            the phrase “from all sources” in the second paragraph of our note on the
                            basis of Mr. Suma’s oral assurance that notwithstanding the omission of
                            this phrase it was clearly intended that the agreement applied to
                            imports into the Philippines of Japanese piece goods from all sources.
                            Mr. Suma assented to this interpretation. Mr. Sayre further observed
                            that in drafting this agreement we had been ever mindful of the
                            desirability of retaining its character as a gentleman’s agreement and
                            therefore we had avoided defining its terms too narrowly. Mr. Sayre
                            pointed out that even without violating the letter of the agreement it
                            might be possible for Japanese exporters to flood the Philippine market
                            by utilizing large carry-overs from previous quarterly periods to bunch
                            heavy shipments in subsequent quarters. Mr. Sayre said that it was quite
                            apparent that such a procedure would be entirely contrary to the spirit
                            of the agreement, the underlying purpose of which was to ensure against
                            any sudden dislocations or disturbances of the market and that it was
                            therefore desirable that shipments be distributed as evenly as possible
                            through the four quarterly periods. Mr. Suma said that he would
                            particularly impress upon his Government and upon the Japanese exporters
                            the importance of this point, the force of which he appreciated, in
                            order to avoid any detrimental influence upon Japanese-American trade
                                relations.<note n="41" xml:id="d823fn41">On January 7, 1939, Mr.
                                Ballantine noted that “Japan is far behind her allotted quota under
                                the agreement”. (611B.9417/307)</note></p>
                        <p>There was then discussed a draft of a proposed press release. Mr. Suma
                            demurred to the giving out of any details regarding the modifications
                            made in the substance of the agreement but finally agreed to submit to
                            his Government for approval the following draft of a proposed press
